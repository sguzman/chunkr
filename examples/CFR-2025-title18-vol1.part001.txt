Where two or more public utilities are parties to the same rate schedule or tariff, each public utility transmitting or selling electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission shall post and file such rate schedule, or the rate schedule may be filed by one such public utility and all other parties having an obligation to file may post and file a certificate of
concurrence on the form indicated in § 131.52 of this chapter:
Provided, however,
In cases where two or more public utilities are required to file rate schedules or certificates of concurrence such public utilities may authorize a designated representative to file upon behalf of all parties if upon written request such parties have been granted Commission authorization therefor.
(b) A rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement applicable to a transmission or sale of electric energy, other than that which proposes to supersede, cancel or otherwise change the provisions of a rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement required to be on file with this Commission, shall be filed as an initial rate in accordance with § 35.12.
(c) A rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement applicable to a transmission or sale of electric energy which proposes to supersede, cancel or otherwise change any of the provisions of a rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement required to be on file with this Commission (such as providing for other or additional rates, charges, classifications or services, or rules, regulations, practices or contracts for a particular customer or customers) shall be filed as a change in rate in accordance with § 35.13, except cancellation or termination which shall be filed as a change in accordance with § 35.15.
(d)(1) The provisions of this paragraph (d) shall apply to rate schedules, tariffs or service agreements tendered for filing on or after August 1, 1976, which are applicable to the transmission or sale of firm power for resale to an all-requirements customer, whether tendered pursuant to § 35.12 as an initial rate schedule or tendered pursuant to § 35.13 as a change in an existing rate schedule whose term has expired or whose term is to be extended.
(2) Rate schedules, tariffs or service agreements covered by the terms of paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall contain the following provision when it is the intent of the contracting parties to give the party furnishing service the unrestricted right to file unilateral rate changes under section 205 of the Federal Power Act:
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as affecting in any way the right of the party furnishing service under this rate schedule to unilaterally make application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a change in rates under section 205 of the Federal Power Act and pursuant to the Commission's Rules and Regulations promulgated thereunder.
(3) Rate schedules, tariffs or service agreements covered by the terms of paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall contain the following provision when it is the intent of the contracting parties to withhold from the party furnishing service the right to file any unilateral rate changes under section 205 of the Federal Power Act:
The rates for service specified herein shall remain in effect for the term of __________ or until __________, and shall not be subject to change through application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to the provisions of Section 205 of the Federal Power Act absent the agreement of all parties thereto.
(4) Rate schedules covered by the terms of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, but which are not covered by paragraphs (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section, are not required to contain either of the boilerplate provisions set forth in paragraph (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section.
(e) No public utility shall, directly or indirectly, demand, charge, collect or receive any rate, charge or compensation for or in connection with electric service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or impose any classification, practice, rule, regulation or contract with respect thereto, which is different from that provided in a rate schedule required to be on file with this Commission unless otherwise specifically provided by order of the Commission for good cause shown.
(f) A rate schedule applicable to the sale of electric power by a public utility to the Bonneville Power Administration under section 5(c) of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Pub. L. No. 96-501 (1980)) shall be filed in accordance with subpart D of this part.
(g) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, any service agreement that conforms to the form of service agreement that is part of the public utility's approved tariff pursuant to § 35.10a of this chapter and any market-based rate service agreement pursuant
to a tariff shall not be filed with the Commission. All agreements must, however, be retained and be made available for public inspection and copying at the public utility's business office during regular business hours and provided to the Commission or members of the public upon request. Any individually executed service agreement for transmission, cost-based power sales, or other generally applicable services that deviates in any material respect from the applicable form of service agreement contained in the public utility's tariff and all unexecuted agreements under which service will commence at the request of the customer, are subject to the filing requirements of this part.

# Subpart B—Documents To Be Submitted With a Filing
§ 35.12
Filing of initial rate schedules and tariffs.
(a) The letter of a public utility transmitting to the Commission for filing an initial rate schedule or tariff shall list the documents submitted with the filing; give the date on which the service under that rate schedule or tariff is expected to commence; state the names and addresses of those to whom the rate schedule or tariff has been mailed; contain a brief description of the kinds of services to be furnished at the rates specified therein; and summarize the circumstances which show that all requisite agreement to the rate schedule or tariff or the filing thereof, including any contract embodied therein, has in fact been obtained. In the case of coordination and interchange arrangements in the nature of power pooling transactions, all supporting data required to be submitted in support of a rate schedule or tariff filing shall also be submitted by parties filing certificates of concurrence, or a representative to file supporting data on behalf of all parties may be designated as provided in § 35.1.
(b) In addition, the following material shall be submitted:
(1) Estimates of the transactions and revenues under an initial rate schedule. This shall include estimates, by months and for the year, of the quantities of services to be rendered and of the revenues to be derived therefrom during the 12 months immediately following the month in which those services will commence. Such estimates should be subdivided by classes of service, customers, and delivery points and shall show all billing determinants, e.g., kw, kwh, fuel adjustment, power factor adjustment. These estimates will not be required where they cannot be made with relative accuracy as, for example, in cases of interconnection arrangements containing schedules of rates for emergency energy, spinning reserve or economy energy or in cases of coordination and integration of hydroelectric generating resources whose output cannot be predicted quantitatively due to water conditions.
(2)(i) Basis of the rate or charge proposed in an initial rate schedule or tariff and an explanation of how the proposed rate or charge was derived. For example, is it a standard rate of the filing public utility; is it a special rate arrived at through negotiations and, if so, were unusual customer requirements or competitive factors involved; and is it designed to produce a return substantially equal to the filing public utility's overall rate of return or is it essentially an increment cost plus a share of the savings rate? Were special cost of service studies prepared in connection with the derivation of the rate?
(ii) A summary statement of all cost (whether fully distributed, incremental or other) computations involved in arriving at the derivation of the level of the rate, in sufficient detail to justify the rate, shall be submitted with the filing, except that if the filing includes nothing more than service to one or more added customers under an established rate of the utility for a particular class of service, such summary statement of cost computations is not required. In all cases, the Secretary is authorized to require the submission of the complete cost studies as part of the filing and each filing public utility shall submit the same upon request by the Secretary in such form as he or she shall direct.
(3) A comparison of the proposed initial rate with other rates of the filing public utility for similar wholesale for resale and transmission services.
(4) If any facilities are installed or modified in order to supply the service to be furnished under the proposed rate schedule or tariff, the filing public utility shall show on an appropriate available map (or sketch) and single line diagram the additions or changes to be made.
(5) In support of the design of the proposed rate, the filing public utility shall submit the same material required to be furnished pursuant to
§ 35.13(h)(37) Statement BL. In addition to the summary cost analysis required by Statement BL, the public utility shall also submit a complete explanation as to the method used in arriving at the cost of service allocated to the sales and service for which the rate or charge is proposed, and showing the principal determinants used for allocation purposes. In connection therewith, the following data should be submitted:
(i) In the event the filing public utility considers certain special facilities as being devoted entirely to the service involved, it shall show the cost of service related to such special facilities.
(ii) Computations showing the energy responsibility of the service, based upon considerations of energy sales under the proposed rate schedule or tariff and the kWh delivered from the filing public utility's supply system.
(iii) Computations showing the demand responsibility of the service, and explaining the considerations upon which such responsibility was determined (e.g., coincident or non-coincident peak demands, etc.).

(iv)
Computing rate increases.
For purposes of this subparagraph and paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of any rate increase shall be the difference between the total revenues to be recovered under the rate change and the total revenues recovered or recoverable under the rate to be superseded or supplemented and shall be determined by:
(A) applying the components of the rate to be superseded or supplemented to the billing determinants for the twelve months of Period I;

Statement BG is a statement of revenues for Period I and Period II, including those under the changed rate for the wholesale services at issue.
(i) For each month of Period I and Period II, and in total for each of the two periods, the utility shall show all billing determinants and metered quantities for each delivery point or set of delivery points that constitutes an individual wholesale customer billing unit, and the result of applying each specific rate component to the billing determinants for each billing unit stated with the total of the computed monthly bill for the customer. If the rates include a fuel clause, the utility shall compute and total the revenues under the fuel clause to reflect fuel costs incurred during each month of Period I and Period II. That is, the fuel clause revenues for the first month of Period I shall reflect fuel costs incurred for that month, and so on for each month of Period I and Period II. In computing fuel clause revenues, the utility shall determine fuel cost according to § 35.14 of this chapter.
(ii) If the form of the proposed fuel clause would produce revenues different from those computed in accordance with clause (i), the utility shall separately compute and state such fuel clause revenues for each customer for each month of Period I and Period II.
(iii) The utility shall summarize separately revenue data computed in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) above for each month and in total for Period I and Period II, in accordance with wholesale rate groups specified in Statement BA under paragraph (h)(26) of this section. The utility shall show total electric department revenues for each period to include revenues under the changed rate for all such wholesale customer rate groups.
(iv) For Period I and as estimated for Period II, the utility shall summarize all billing determinants and revenues received from interruptible or curtailable services. Billing determinants and revenue data shall be consistent with interruptible demand and energy data in Statements BB and BD. The utility shall include an explanation of the extent to which interruptible or curtailable service revenues are or are not included in revenue credits in Statement AU under paragraph (h)(21) of this section.
(33)
Statement BH—Revenue data to reflect present rates.
Statement BH is a statement of revenues for Period I and Period II, including those under present rates for wholesale services at issue, and for total electric service to reflect such revenues for wholesale services. The utility shall prepare this statement to include data consistent with criteria specified for presentation of revenue under the changed rate in Statement BG under paragraph (h)(32) of this section.
(34)
Statement BI—Fuel cost adjustment factors.
Statement BI is a statement of monthly fuel cost adjustment factors under the changed rate and under the present rates, for Period I and Period II.
(i) If the changed rate schedule embodies a fuel cost adjustment clause, the utility shall show detailed derivations of fuel cost adjustment factors computed to reflect fuel cost incurred during each month of Period I and Period II. Fuel cost adjustment factors are those required for revenue determinations in accordance with paragraph (h)(32)(i) of Statement BG.
(ii) If additional proposed fuel clause revenue data are reported in accordance with paragraph (h)(32)(ii) of Statement BG, the utility shall show detailed derivation of applicable monthly fuel adjustment factors.
(iii) If the present rate includes a fuel cost adjustment change, the utility shall show detailed derivations of fuel cost adjustment factors for each month of Period I and Period II. The utility shall include in Statement BI derivations for all monthly factors required in the computation of present fuel clause revenues reported in Statement BH. The utility shall provide an explanation of the differences between the present and proposed fuel clauses.
(iv) All fuel cost adjustment factors shall be cost-based. The utility shall make a computational showing that shall develop adjustment factors in a manner consistent with the requirements of § 35.14 of this chapter. The utility shall provide supporting detail on cost by type of fuel, and shall show separately the allowable fuel clause cost component of purchased or interchanged energy.

# Subpart C—Other Filing Requirements
§ 35.14
Fuel cost and purchased economic power adjustment clauses.
(a) Fuel adjustment clauses (fuel clause) which are not in conformity with the principles set out below are not in the public interest. These regulations contemplate that the filing of proposed rate schedules, tariffs or service agreements which embody fuel clauses failing to conform to the following principles may result in suspension of those parts of such rate schedules, tariffs, or service agreements:
(1) The fuel clause shall be of the form that provides for periodic adjustments per kWh of sales equal to the difference between the fuel and purchased economic power costs per kWh of sales in the base period and in the current period:
Adjustment Factor =
Fm/Sm-Fb/Sb
Where:
F
is the expense of fossil and nuclear fuel and purchased economic power in the base (
b
) and current (
m
) periods; and S is the kWh sales in the base and current periods, all as defined below.
(2) Fuel and purchased economic power costs (
F
) shall be the cost of:
(i) Fossil and nuclear fuel consumed in the utility's own plants, and the utility's share of fossil and nuclear fuel consumed in jointly owned or leased plants.
(ii) The actual identifiable fossil and nuclear fuel costs associated with energy purchased for reasons other than identified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
(iii) The total cost of the purchase of economic power, as defined in paragraph (a)(11) of this section, if the reserve capacity of the buyer is adequate independent of all other purchases where non-fuel charges are included in either
F
b
or
F
m
;
(iv) Energy charges for any purchase if the total amount of energy charges incurred for the purchase is less than the buyer's total avoided variable cost;
(v)
And less
the cost of fossil and nuclear fuel recovered through all inter-system sales.
(3) Sales (S) must be all kWh's sold, excluding inter-system sales. Where for any reason, billed system sales cannot be coordinated with fuel costs for the billing period, sales may be equated to the sum of: (i) Generation, (ii) purchases, (iii) exchange received, less (iv) energy associated with pumped storage operations, less (v) inter-system sales referred to in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section, less (vi) total system losses.
(4) The adjustment factor developed according to this procedure shall be modified to properly allow for losses (estimated if necessary) associated only with wholesale sales for resale.
(5) The adjustment factor developed according to this procedure may be further modified to allow the recovery of gross receipts and other similar revenue based tax charges occasioned by the fuel adjustment revenues.
(6) The cost of fossil fuel shall include no items other than those listed in Account 151 of the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts for Public Utilities and Licensees. The cost of nuclear fuel shall be that as shown in Account 518, except that if Account 518 also contains any expense for fossil fuel which has already been included in the cost of fossil fuel, it shall be deducted from this account. (Paragraph C of Account 518 includes the cost of other fuels used for ancillary steam facilities.)
(7) Where the cost of fuel includes fuel from company-owned or controlled
1
sources, that fact shall be noted and described as part of any filing. Where the utility purchases fuel from a company-owned or controlled source, the price of which is subject to the jurisdiction of a regulatory body, and where the price of such fuel has been approved by that regulatory body, such costs shall be presumed, subject to rebuttal, to be reasonable and includable in the adjustment clause. If the current price, however, is in litigation and is being collected subject to refund, the utility shall so advise the Commission and shall keep a separate account of such amounts paid which are subject to refund, and shall advise the Commission of the final disposition of such matter by the regulatory body having jurisdiction. With respect to the price of fuel purchases from company-owned or controlled sources pursuant to contracts which are not subject to regulatory authority, the utility company shall file such contracts and amendments thereto with the Commission for its acceptance at the time it files its fuel clause or modification thereof. Any subsequent amendment to such contracts shall likewise be filed with the Commission as a rate schedule change and may be subject to suspension under section 205 of the Federal Power Act. Fuel charges by affiliated companies which do not appear to be reasonable may result in the suspension of the fuel adjustment clause or cause an investigation thereof to be made by the Commission on its own motion under section 206 of the Federal Power Act.
1
As defined in the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts 18 CFR part 101, Definitions 5B.
(8) All rate filings which contain a proposed new fuel clause or a change in an existing fuel clause shall conform such clauses with the regulations. Within one year of the effectiveness of this rulemaking, all public utilities with rate schedules that contain a fuel clause should conform such clauses with the regulations. Recognizing that individual public utilities may have special operating characteristics that may warrant granting temporary delays in the implementation of the regulations, the Commission may, upon showing of good cause, waive the requirements of this section of the regulations for an additional one-year period so as to permit the public utilities sufficient time to adjust to the requirements.
(9) All rate filings containing a proposed new fuel clause or change in an existing fuel clause shall include:
(i) A description of the fuel clause with detailed cost support for the base cost of fuel and purchased economic power or energy.
(ii) Full cost of service data unless the utility has had the rate approved by the Commission within a year, provided that such cost of service may not be required when an existing fuel cost adjustment clause is being modified to conform to the Commission's regulations.
(10) Whenever particular circumstances prevent the use of the standards provided for herein, or the use thereof would result in an undue burden, the Commission may, upon application under § 385.207 of this chapter and for good cause shown, permit deviation from these regulations.
(11) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the following definitions apply:
(i)
Economic power
is power or energy purchased over a period of twelve months or less where the total cost of the purchase is less than the buyer's total avoided variable cost.
(ii)
Total cost of the purchase
is all charges incurred in buying economic power and having such power delivered to the buyer's system. The total cost includes, but is not limited to, capacity or reservation charges, energy charges, adders, and any transmission or wheeling charges associated with the purchase.
(iii)
Total avoided variable cost
is all identified and documented variable costs that would have been incurred by the buyer had a particular purchase not been made. Such costs include, but are not limited to, those associated with fuel, start-up, shut-down or any purchases that would have been made in lieu of the purchase made.
(12) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the following procedures and instructions apply:
(i) A utility proposing to include purchase charges other than those for fuel or energy in fuel and purchased economic power costs (
F)
under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section shall amend its fuel cost adjustment clause so that it is consistent with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section. Such amendment shall state the system reserve capacity criteria by which the system operator decides whether a reliability purchase is required. Where the utility filing the statement is required by a State or local regulatory body (including a plant site licensing board) to file a capacity criteria statement with that body, the system reserve capacity criteria in the statement filed with the Commission shall be identical to those contained in the statement filed with the State or local regulatory body. Any utility that changes its reserve capacity criteria shall, within 45 days of such change, file an amended fuel cost and purchased economic power adjustment clause to incorporate the new criteria.
(ii) Reserve capacity shall be deemed adequate if, at the time a purchase was initiated, the buyer's system reserve capacity criteria were projected to be satisfied for the duration of the purchase without the purchase at issue.
(iii) The total cost of the purchase must be projected to be less than total avoided variable cost, at the time a purchase was initiated, before any non-fuel purchase charge may be included in
F
m.
(iv) The purchasing utility shall make a credit to
F
m
after a purchase terminates if the total cost of the purchase exceeds the total avoided variable cost. The amount of the credit shall be the difference between the total cost of the purchase and the total avoided variable cost. This credit shall be made in the first adjustment period after the end of the purchase. If a utility fails to make the credit in the first adjustment period after the end of the purchase, it shall, when making the credit, also include in
F
m
interest on the amount of the credit. Interest shall be calculated at the rate required by § 35.19a(a)(2)(iii) of this chapter, and shall accrue from the date the credit should have been made under this paragraph until the date the credit is made.
(v) If a purchase is made of more capacity than is needed to satisfy the buyer's system reserve capacity criteria because the total costs of the extra capacity and associated energy are less than the buyer's total avoided variable costs for the duration of the
purchase, the charges associated with the non-reliability portion of the purchase may be included in
F.

Upon the filing of such motion, the proposed rate schedule, tariff or service agreement sections will not become effective under section 205(d) of the Federal Power Act in the absence of Commission action making the rate schedule, tariff or service agreement filing effective.
(2) The withdrawal motion will become effective, and the rate schedule, tariff or service agreement filing will be deemed withdrawn, at the end of 15 days from the date of filing of the withdrawal motion, if no answer in opposition to the withdrawal motion is filed
within that period and if no order disallowing the withdrawal is issued within that period. If an answer in opposition is filed within the 15 day period, the withdrawal is not effective until an order accepting the withdrawal is issued.
(b)
Amendments or modifications to rate schedule, tariff or service agreement sections prior to Commission action on the filing.
A public utility may file to amend or modify, and may file a settlement that would amend or modify, a rate schedule, tariff or service agreement section contained in a rate schedule, tariff or service agreement filing that has not become effective and upon which no Commission or delegated order has yet been issued. Such filing will toll the notice period in section 205(d) of the Federal Power Act for the original filing, and establish a new date on which the entire filing will become effective, in the absence of Commission action, no earlier than 61 days from the date of the filing of the amendment or modification.
(c)
Withdrawal of suspended rate schedules, tariffs, or service agreements, or parts thereof.
Where a rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement, or part thereof has been suspended by the Commission, it may be withdrawn during the period of suspension only by special permission of the Commission granted upon application therefor and for good cause shown. If permitted to be withdrawn, any such rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement may be refiled with the Commission within a one-year period thereafter only with special permission of the Commission for good cause shown.
(d)
Changes in suspended rate schedules, tariffs, or service agreements, or parts thereof.
A public utility may not, within the period of suspension, file any change in a rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement, or part thereof, which has been suspended by order of the Commission except by special permission of the Commission granted upon application therefor and for good cause shown.
(e)
Changes in rate schedules or tariffs or parts thereof continued in effect and which were proposed to be changed by the suspended filing.
A public utility may not, within the period of suspension, file any change in a rate schedule or tariff or part thereof continued in effect by operation of an order of suspension and which was proposed to be changed by the suspended filing, except by special permission of the Commission granted upon application therefor and for good cause shown.

§ 35.18
Asset retirement obligations.
(a) A public utility that files a rate schedule, tariff or service agreement under § 35.12 or § 35.13 and has recorded an asset retirement obligation on its books must provide a schedule, as part of the supporting work papers, identifying all cost components related to the asset retirement obligations that are included in the book balances of all accounts reflected in the cost of service computation supporting the proposed rates. However, all cost components related to asset retirement obligations that would impact the calculation of rate base, such as electric plant and related accumulated depreciation and accumulated deferred income taxes, may not be reflected in rates and must be removed from the rate base calculation through a single adjustment.
(b) A public utility seeking to recover nonrate base costs related to asset retirement costs in rates must provide, with its filing under § 35.12 or § 35.13, a detailed study supporting the amounts proposed to be collected in rates.
(c) A public utility that has recorded asset retirement obligations on its books, but is not seeking recovery of the asset retirement costs in rates, must remove all asset-retirement-obligations-related cost components from the cost of service supporting its proposed rates.

§ 35.19a
Refund requirements under suspension orders.
(a)
Refunds.
(1) The public utility whose proposed increased rates or charges were suspended shall refund at such time in such amounts and in such manner as required by final order of the Commission the portion of any increased rates or charges found by the Commission in that suspension proceeding not to be justified, together with interest as required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) Interest shall be computed from the date of collection until the date refunds are made as follows:
(i) At a rate of seven percent simple interest per annum on all excessive rates or charges held prior to October 10, 1974;

(iii)(A) At an average prime rate for each calendar quarter on all excessive rates or charges held (including all interest applicable to such rates or charges) on or after October 1, 1979. The applicable average prime rate for each calendar quarter shall be the arithmetic mean, to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent, of the prime rate values published in the
Federal Reserve Bulletin,
or in the Federal Reserve's “Selected Interest Rates” (Statistical Release H. 15), for the fourth, third, and second months preceding the first month of the calendar quarter.
(B) The interest required to be paid under clause (iii)(A) shall be compounded quarterly.
(3) Any public utility required to make refunds pursuant to this section shall bear all costs of such refunding.
(b)

§ 35.23
General provisions.
(a)
Applicability.
This subpart applies to any wholesale sale of electric energy in a coordination transaction by a public utility if that sale requires the use of an emissions allowance.
(b)
Implementation Procedures.
(1) If a public utility has a coordination rate schedule on file that expressly provides for the recovery of all incremental or out-of-pocket costs, such utility may make an abbreviated rate filing detailing how it will recover emissions allowance costs. Such filing must include the following: the index or combination of indices to be used; the method by which the emission allowance amounts will be calculated; timing procedures; how inconsistencies, if any, with dispatch criteria will be reconciled; and how any other rate impacts will be addressed. In addition, a utility making an abbreviated filing must:
(i) Clearly identify the filing as being limited to an amendment to a coordination rate to reflect the cost of emissions allowances, in the first paragraph of the letter of transmittal accompanying the filing;
(ii) Submit the revisions in accordance with § 35.7; and
(iii) Identify each rate schedule to which the amendment applies.
(2) The abbreviated filing must apply consistent treatment to all coordination rate schedules. If the filing does not apply consistent rate treatment, the public utility must explain why it does not do so.
(3) If a public utility wants to charge incremental costs for emissions allowances, but its rate schedule on file with the Commission does not provide for the recovery of all incremental costs, the selling public utility may submit an abbreviated filing if all customers agree to the rate change. If customers do not agree, the selling public utility must tender its emissions allowance proposal in a separate section 205 rate filing, fully justifying its proposal.

General rules
—(1)
Tax normalization required.
(i) A public utility must compute the income tax component of its cost of service by using tax normalization for all transactions to which this section applies.
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, application of tax normalization by a public utility under this section to compute the income tax component will not be subject to case-by-case adjudication.
(2)
Reduction of, and addition to, rate base.
(i) The rate base of a public utility using tax normalization under this section must be reduced by the balances that are properly recordable in Account 281, “Accumulated deferred income taxes-accelerated amortization property;” Account 282, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—other property;” and Account 283, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—other.” Balances that are properly recordable in Account 190, “Accumulated deferred income taxes,” must be treated as an addition to rate base.
(ii) Such rate base reductions or additions must be limited to deferred taxes related to rate base, construction or other jurisdictional activities.
(iii) If a public utility uses an approved purchased gas adjustment clause or a research, development and demonstration tracking clause, the rate base reductions or additions required under this subparagraph must apply only to the extent that the balances in Account 190 and Accounts 281 through 283 are not used, for purposes
of calculating carrying charges, as an offset to balances properly recordable in Account 188, “Research development and demonstration expenditures,” or Account 191, “Unrecovered purchased gas costs.”
(c)
Special rules.
(1) This paragraph applies:
(i) If the public utility has not provided deferred taxes in the same amount that would have accrued had tax normalization been applied for the tax effects of timing difference transactions originating at any time prior to the test period; or
(ii) If, as a result of changes in tax rates, the accumulated provision for deferred taxes becomes deficient in or in excess of amounts necessary to meet future tax liabilities as determined by application of the current tax rate to all timing difference transactions originating in the test period and prior to the test period.
(2) The public utility must compute the income tax component in its cost of service by making provision for any excess or deficiency in deferred taxes described in subparagraphs (1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this paragraph.
(3) The public utility must apply a Commission-approved ratemaking method made specifically applicable to the public utility for determining the cost of service provision described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. If no Commission-approved ratemaking method has been made specifically applicable to the public utility, then the public utility must use some ratemaking method for making such provision, and the appropriateness of this method will be subject to case-by-case determination.
(d)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the term:
(1)
Tax normalization
means computing the income tax component as if the amounts of timing difference transactions recognized in each period for ratemaking purposes were also recognized in the same amount in each such period for income tax purposes.
(2)
Timing differences
means differences between amounts of expenses or revenues recognized for income tax purposes and amounts of expenses or revenues recognized for ratemaking purposes, which differences arise in one time period and reverse in one or more other time periods so that the total amounts of expenses or revenues recognized for income tax purposes and for ratemaking purposes are equal.
(3)
Commission-approved ratemaking method
means a ratemaking method approved by the Commission in a final decision including approval of a settlement agreement containing a ratemaking method only if such settlement agreement applies that method beyond the effective term of the settlement agreement.
(4)
Income tax purposes
means for the purpose of computing income tax under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or the income tax provisions of the laws of a State or political subdivision of a State (including franchise taxes).
(5)
Income tax component
means that part of the cost of service that covers income tax expenses allowable by the Commission.
(6)
Ratemaking purposes
means for the purpose of fixing, modifying, approving, disapproving or rejecting rates under the Federal Power Act or the Natural Gas Act.
(7)
Tax effect
means the tax reduction or addition associated with a specific expense or revenue transaction.
(8)
Transaction
means an activity or event that gives rise to an accounting entry that is used in determining revenues or expenses.

§ 35.25
Construction work in progress.
(a)
Applicability.
This section applies to any rate schedule filed under this part by any public utility as defined in subsection 201(e) of the Federal Power Act.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section:
(1)
Constuction work in progress
or
CWIP
means any expenditure for public utility plant in process of construction that is properly included in Accounts 107 (construction work in progress) and 120.1 (nuclear fuel in process of refinement, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication) of part 101 of this chapter, the
Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Public Utilities and Licensees Subject to the Provisions of the Federal Power Act (Major and Nonmajor), that would otherwise be eligible for allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) treatment.
(2)
Double whammy
means a situation which may arise when a wholesale electric rate customer embarks upon its own or participates in a construction program to supply itself with all or a portion of its future power needs, thereby reducing its future dependence on the CWIP of the rate applicant, but is simultaneously forced to pay to the CWIP public utility rate applicant the CWIP portion of the wholesale rates that reflects existing levels of service or a different anticipated service level.
(3)
Fuel conversion facility
means any addition to public utility plant that enables a natural gas-burning plant to convert to the use of other fuels, or that enables an oil-burning plant to convert to the use of other fuels, other than natural gas. Such facilities include those that alter internal plant workings, such as oil or coal burners, soot blowers, bottom ash removal systems and concomitant air pollution control facilities, and any facility needed for receiving and storing the fuel to which the plant is being converted, which facility would not be necessary if the plant continued to burn gas or oil.
(4)
Pollution control facility
means an identifiable structure or portions of a structure that is designed to reduce the amount of pollution produced by the power plant, but does not include any facility that reduces pollution by substituting a different method of generation or that generates the additional power necessitated by the operation of a pollution control facility.
(c)
General rule.
For purposes of any initial rate schedule or any rate schedule change filed under § 35.12 or § 35.13 of this part, a public utility may include in its rate base any costs of construction work in progress (CWIP), including allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC), as provided in this section.
(1)
Pollution control facilities
—(i)
General rule.
Any CWIP for pollution control facilities allocable to electric power sales for resale may be included in the rate base of the public utility.
(ii)
Qualification as a pollution control facility.
In determining whether a facility is a pollution control facility for purposes of this section, the Commission will consider:
(A) Whether such facility is the type facility described in the Internal Revenue Service laws, 26 U.S.C. 169(d)(1), as follows:
“A new identifiable treatment facility which is used * * * to abate or control water or atmospheric pollution or contamination by removing, altering, disposing, storing, or preventing the creation or emission of pollutants, contaminants, wastes or heat”;
(B) Whether such facility has been certified by a local, state, or federal agency as being in conformity with, or required by, a program of pollution control;
(C) Other evidence showing that such facilities are for pollution control.
(2)
Fuel conversion facilities.
Any CWIP for fuel conversion facilities allocable to electric power sales for resale may be included in the rate base of the public utility.
(3)
Non-pollution control of fuel conversion (non-PC/FC) CWIP.
No more than 50 percent of any CWIP allocable to electric power sales for resale not otherwise included in rate base under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, may be included in the rate base of the public utility.
(4)
Forward looking allocation ratios.
Every test period CWIP project requested for wholesale rate base treatment pursuant to § 35.26(c)(1), (2), and (3) of this part will be allocated to the customer classes on the basis of forward looking allocation ratios reflecting the anticipated average annual use the wholesale customers will make of the system over the estimated service life of the project. Supporting documentation, as required by §§ 35.12 and 35.13 of this part, must be in sufficient detail to permit examination and verification of the forward looking allocation ratio's recognition of each wholesale customer's plans, if any, for future alternative or supplementary power supplies. For the purpose of preventing anticompetitive effects, including CWIP-induced price squeeze
and double whammy, sufficient recognition of such plans may require the public utility applicant to provide for separate customer groups or provide for a rate design incorporating selected CWIP project credits.
(d)
Effective date.
If a public utility proposes in its filed rates to include CWIP in rate base under this section, that portion of the rate related to CWIP is collectible at the time the general rates become effective pursuant to Commission order, whether or not subject to refund, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section.
(e)
Discontinuance of AFUDC.
On the date that any proposed rate that includes CWIP in rate base becomes effective, a public utility that has included CWIP in rate base must discontinue the capitalization of any AFUDC related to those amounts of CWIP is rate base.
(f)
Accounting procedures.
When a public utility files to include CWIP in its rate base pursuant to this section, it must propose accounting procedures in that rate schedule filing that:
(1) Ensure that wholesale customers will not be charged for both capitalized AFUDC and corresponding amounts of CWIP proposed to be included in rate base; and
(2) Ensure that wholesale customers will not be charged for any corresponding AFUDC capitalized as a result of different accounting or ratemaking treatments accorded CWIP by state or local regulatory authorities.
(g)
Anticompetitive procedures
—(1)
Filing requirements.
In order to facilitate Commission review of the anticompetitive effects of applications for CWIP pursuant to § 35.26(c)(3), a public utility applying for rates based upon inclusion of such CWIP in rate base must include the following information in its filing:
(i) The percentage of the proposed increase in the jurisdictional rate level attributable to non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP and the percentage of non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP supporting the proposed rate level;
(ii) The percentage of non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP permitted by the state or local commission supporting the current retail rates of the public utility against which the relevant wholesale customers compete; and
(iii) Individual earned rate of return analyses of each of the competing retail rates developed on a basis fully consistent with the wholesale cost of service for the same test period if the requested percentage of wholesale non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP exceeds that permitted by the relevant state or local authority to support the currently competing retail rates.
(2)
Preliminary relief.
(i) If an intervenor in its initial pleading alleges that a price squeeze will occur as a direct result of the public utility's request for CWIP pursuant to § 35.26(c)(3), makes a showing that it is likely to incur harm if such CWIP is allowed subject to refund, and makes a showing of how the harm to the intervenor would be mitigated or eliminated by the types of preliminary relief requested, the Commission will consider preliminary relief at the suspension stage of the case pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section. In determining whether to grant preliminary relief, the Commission will balance the following public interest considerations:
(A) The harm to the intervenor if it is not granted preliminary relief from the requested CWIP;
(B) The harm to the public utility if, during the interim period of preliminary relief, the public utility is required to recover its financing charges later through AFUDC rather than immediately through CWIP; and
(C) Mitigating bias against investment in new plants, ensuring accurate price signals, and fostering rate stability.
(ii) Whether or not preliminary relief is granted at the suspension stage will not preclude consideration of further interim or final remedies later in the proceedings, if warranted.
(3) If the Commission makes a final determination that a price squeeze due solely to allowance of a lower percentage of non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP in the public utility's retail rate base than allowed by this Commission, the Commission will consider an adjustment to non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP in order to eliminate or mitigate the price squeeze.
(4) If an intervenor meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the Commission, depending on the type of showing made including the likelihood, immediacy, and severity of any anticompetitive harm, may:
(i) Suspend the entire rate increase or all or a portion of the non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP component for up to five months;
(ii) Allow all or a portion of the non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP only prospectively from the issuance of the Commission's final order on rehearing on the matter; or
(iii) Take such other action as is proper under the circumstances.

(c)
Recovery of wholesale stranded costs
—(1)
General requirement.
A public utility or transmitting utility will be allowed to seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs only as follows:
(i) No public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs if such recovery is explicitly prohibited by a contract or settlement agreement, or by any power sales or transmission rate schedule or tariff.
(ii) No public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of stranded costs associated with a new wholesale requirements contract if such contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision.
(iii) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with a new wholesale requirements contract containing an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, and the seller under the contract is a public utility, the public utility may seek recovery of such costs, in accordance with the contract, through rates for electric energy under sections 205-206 of the FPA. The public utility may not seek recovery of such costs through any transmission rate for FPA section 205 or 211 transmission services.
(iv) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with a new wholesale requirements contract, and the seller under the contract is a transmitting utility but not also a public utility, the transmitting utility may not seek an order from the Commission allowing recovery of such costs.
(v) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, if the seller under such contract is a public utility, and if the contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, the public utility may seek recovery of stranded costs only as follows:
(A) If either party to the contract seeks a stranded cost amendment pursuant to a section 205 or section 206 filing under the FPA made prior to the expiration of the contract, and the Commission accepts or approves an amendment permitting recovery of stranded costs, the public utility may seek recovery of such costs through FPA section 205-206 rates for electric energy.
(B) If the contract is not amended to permit recovery of stranded costs as described in paragraph (c)(1)(v)(A) of this section, the public utility may file a proposal, prior to the expiration of the contract, to recover stranded costs through FPA section 205-206 or section 211-212 rates for wholesale transmission services to the customer.
(vi) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, if the seller under such contract is a transmitting utility but not also a public utility, and if the contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, the transmitting utility may seek recovery of stranded costs through FPA section 211-212 transmission rates.
(vii) If a retail customer becomes a legitimate wholesale transmission customer of a public utility or transmitting utility,
e.g.,
through municipalization, and costs are stranded as a result of the retail-turned-wholesale customer's access to wholesale transmission, the utility may seek recovery of such costs through FPA section 205-206 or section 211-212 rates for wholesale transmission services to that customer.
(2)
Evidentiary demonstration for wholesale stranded cost recovery.
A public utility or transmitting utility seeking to recover wholesale stranded costs in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) (v) through (vii) of this section must demonstrate that:
(i) It incurred costs to provide service to a wholesale requirements customer or retail customer based on a reasonable expectation that the utility would continue to serve the customer;
(ii) The stranded costs are not more than the customer would have contributed to the utility had the customer remained a wholesale requirements customer of the utility, or, in the case of a retail-turned-wholesale customer, had the customer remained a retail customer of the utility; and
(iii) The stranded costs are derived using the following formula: Stranded Cost Obligation = (Revenue Stream Estimate—Competitive Market Value Estimate) × Length of Obligation (reasonable expectation period).
(3)
Rebuttable presumption.
If a public utility or transmitting utility seeks recovery of wholesale stranded costs associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, as permitted in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the existing wholesale requirements contract contains a notice provision, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve the customer beyond the term of the notice provision.
(4)
Procedure for customer to obtain stranded cost estimate.
A customer under an existing wholesale requirements contract with a public utility seller may obtain from the seller an estimate of the customer's stranded cost obligation if it were to leave the public utility's generation supply system by filing with the public utility a request for an estimate at any time prior to the termination date specified in its contract.
(i) The public utility must provide a response within 30 days of receiving the request. The response must include:
(A) An estimate of the customer's stranded cost obligation based on the
formula in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section;
(B) Supporting detail indicating how each element in the formula was derived;
(C) A detailed rationale justifying the basis for the utility's reasonable expectation of continuing to serve the customer beyond the termination date in the contract;
(D) An estimate of the amount of released capacity and associated energy that would result from the customer's departure; and
(E) The utility's proposal for any contract amendment needed to implement the customer's payment of stranded costs.
(ii) If the customer disagrees with the utility's response, it must respond to the utility within 30 days explaining why it disagrees. If the parties cannot work out a mutually agreeable resolution, they may exercise their rights to Commission resolution under the FPA.
(5) A customer must be given the option to market or broker a portion or all of the capacity and energy associated with any stranded costs claimed by the public utility.
(i) To exercise the option, the customer must so notify the utility in writing no later than 30 days after the public utility files its estimate of stranded costs for the customer with the Commission.
(A) Before marketing or brokering can begin, the utility and customer must execute an agreement identifying, at a minimum, the amount and the price of capacity and associated energy the customer is entitled to schedule, and the duration of the customer's marketing or brokering of such capacity and energy.
(ii) If agreement over marketing or brokering cannot be reached, and the parties seek Commission resolution of disputed issues, upon issuance of a Commission order resolving the disputed issues, the customer may reevaluate its decision in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section to exercise the marketing or brokering option. The customer must notify the utility in writing within 30 days of issuance of the Commission's order resolving the disputed issues whether the customer will market or broker a portion or all of the capacity and energy associated with stranded costs allowed by the Commission.
(iii) If a customer undertakes the brokering option, and the customer's brokering efforts fail to produce a buyer within 60 days of the date of the brokering agreement entered into between the customer and the utility, the customer shall relinquish all rights to broker the released capacity and associated energy and will pay stranded costs as determined by the formula in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
(d)
Recovery of retail stranded costs
—(1)
General requirement.
A public utility may seek to recover retail stranded costs through rates for retail transmission services only if the state regulatory authority does not have authority under state law to address stranded costs at the time the retail wheeling is required.
(2)
Evidentiary demonstration necessary for retail stranded cost recovery.
A public utility seeking to recover retail stranded costs in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section must demonstrate that:
(i) It incurred costs to provide service to a retail customer that obtains retail wheeling based on a reasonable expectation that the utility would continue to serve the customer; and
(ii) The stranded costs are not more than the customer would have contributed to the utility had the customer remained a retail customer of the utility.

(1) A public utility subject to the requirements of this section and 18 CFR parts 37 (Open Access Same-Time Information System) and 358 (Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers) may file a request for waiver of all or part of such requirements for good cause shown. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, an application for waiver must be filed no later than 60 days prior to the time the public utility would have to comply with the requirement.
(2) The requirements of this section, 18 CFR parts 37 (Open Access Same-Time Information System) and 358 (Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers) are waived for any public utility that is or becomes subject to such requirements solely because it owns, controls, or operates Interconnection Customer's Interconnection Facilities, in whole or in part, as that term is defined in the standard generator interconnection procedures and agreements referenced in paragraph (f) of this section, or comparable jurisdictional interconnection facilities that are the subject of interconnection agreements other than the standard generator interconnection procedures and agreements referenced in paragraph (f) of this section, if the entity that owns, operates, or controls such facilities either sells electric energy, or files a statement with the Commission that it commits to comply with and be bound by the obligations and procedures applicable to electric utilities under section 210 of the Federal Power Act.
(i) The waivers referenced in this paragraph (d)(2) shall be deemed to be revoked as of the date the public utility ceases to satisfy the qualifications of this paragraph (d)(2), and may be revoked by the Commission if the Commission determines that it is in the public interest to do so. After revocation of its waivers, the public utility must comply with the requirements that had been waived within 60 days of revocation.
(ii) Any eligible entity that seeks interconnection or transmission services with respect to the interconnection facilities for which a waiver is in effect pursuant to this paragraph (d)(2) may follow the procedures in sections 210, 211, and 212 of the Federal Power Act, 18 CFR 2.20, and 18 CFR part 36. In any proceeding pursuant to this paragraph (d)(2)(ii):
(A) The Commission will consider it to be in the public interest to grant priority rights to the owner and/or operator of interconnection facilities specified in this paragraph (d)(2) to use capacity thereon when such owner and/or operator can demonstrate that it has specific plans with milestones to use such capacity to interconnect its or its affiliate's future generation projects.
(B) For the first five years after the commercial operation date of the interconnection facilities specified in this paragraph (d)(2), the Commission will apply the rebuttable presumption that the owner and/or operator of such facilities has definitive plans to use the capacity thereon, and it is thus in the public interest to grant priority rights to the owner and/or operator of such facilities to use capacity thereon.
(e)
Non-public utility procedures for tariff reciprocity compliance.
(1) A non-public utility may submit an open access transmission tariff and a request for declaratory order that its voluntary transmission tariff meets the requirements of Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the
pro forma
tariff.

(
3
) A maximum amount of electric energy reduction that the demand response resource may be required to provide either daily or weekly.
(ii)
Removal of deviation charges.
A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization with a tariff that contains a day-ahead and a real-time market may not assess charge to a purchaser of electric energy in its day-ahead market for purchasing less power in the real-time market during a real-time market period for which the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization declares an operating reserve shortage or makes a generic request to reduce load to avoid an operating reserve shortage.
(iii)
Aggregation of retail customers.
Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must accept bids from an aggregator of retail customers that aggregates the demand response of the customers of utilities that distributed more than 4 million megawatt-hours in the previous fiscal year, and the customers of utilities that distributed 4 million megawatt-hours or less in the previous fiscal year, where the relevant electric retail regulatory authority permits such customers' demand response to be bid into organized markets by an aggregator of retail customers. An independent system operator or regional transmission organization must not accept bids from an aggregator of retail customers that aggregates the demand response of the customers of utilities that distributed more than 4 million megawatt-hours in the previous fiscal year, where the relevant electric retail regulatory authority prohibits such customers' demand response to be bid into organized markets by an aggregator of retail customers, or the customers of utilities that distributed 4 million megawatt-hours or less in the previous fiscal year, unless the relevant electric retail regulatory authority permits such customers' demand response to be bid into organized markets by an aggregator of retail customers.
(iv)
Price formation during periods of operating reserve shortage.
(A) Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must modify its market rules to allow the market-clearing price during periods of operating reserve shortage to reach a level that rebalances supply and demand so as to maintain reliability while providing sufficient provisions for mitigating market power. Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must trigger shortage pricing for any interval in which a shortage of energy or operating reserves is indicated during the pricing of resources for that interval.
(B) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization may phase in this modification of its market rules.

(A) Pay to those demand response resources the market price for energy for these reductions when these demand response resources have the capability to balance supply and demand and when payment of the market price for energy to these resources is cost-effective as determined by a net benefits test accepted by the Commission;
(B) Allocate the costs associated with demand response compensation proportionally to all entities that purchase from the relevant energy market in the area(s) where the demand response reduces the market price for energy at the time when the demand response resource is committed or dispatched.
(vi)
Settlement intervals.
Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must settle energy transactions in its real-time markets at the same time interval it dispatches energy, must settle operating reserves transactions in its real-time markets at the same time interval it prices operating reserves, and must settle intertie transactions at the same time
interval it schedules intertie transactions.
(2)
Long-term power contracting in organized markets.
Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must provide a portion of its Web site for market participants to post offers to buy or sell power on a long-term basis.

The business practices and procedures must ensure that the interests of customers or other stakeholders are equitably considered, and that deliberation and consideration of Commission-approved independent system operator's and regional transmission organization's issues are not dominated by any single stakeholder category;
(iii)
Representation of minority positions.
The business practices and procedures must ensure that, in instances where stakeholders are not in total agreement on a particular issue, minority positions are communicated to the Commission-approved independent system operator's and regional transmission organization's board of directors at the same time as majority positions; and
(iv)
Ongoing responsiveness.
The business practices and procedures must provide for stakeholder input into the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's decisions as well as mechanisms to provide feedback to stakeholders to ensure that information exchange and communication continue over time.
(7)
Compliance filings.
All Commission-approved independent system operators and regional transmission organizations must make a compliance filing with the Commission as described in Order No. 719 under the following schedule:
(i) The compliance filing addressing the accepting of bids from demand response resources in markets for ancillary services on a basis comparable to other resources, removal of deviation charges, aggregation of retail customers, shortage pricing during periods of operating reserve shortage, long-term power contracting in organized markets, Market Monitoring Units, Commission-approved independent system operators' and regional transmission organizations' board of directors' responsiveness, and reporting on the study of the need for further reforms to remove barriers to comparable treatment of demand response resources must be submitted on or before April 28, 2009.
(ii) A public utility that is approved as a regional transmission organization under § 35.34, or that is not approved but begins to operate regional markets for electric energy or ancillary services after December 29, 2008, must comply with Order No. 719 and the provisions of paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(5) of this section before beginning operations.
(8)
Frequency regulation compensation in ancillary services markets.
Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization that has a tariff that provides for the compensation for frequency regulation service must provide such compensation based on the actual service provided, including a capacity payment that includes the marginal unit's opportunity costs and a payment for performance that reflects the quantity of frequency regulation service provided by a resource when the resource is accurately following the dispatch signal.
(9)
Electric storage resources.
(i) Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must have tariff provisions providing a participation model for electric storage resources that:
(A) Ensures that a resource using the participation model for electric storage resources in an independent system operator or regional transmission organization market is eligible to provide all capacity, energy, and ancillary services that it is technically capable of providing;
(B) Enables a resource using the participation model for electric storage resources to be dispatched and ensures that such a dispatchable resource can set the wholesale market clearing price as both a wholesale seller and wholesale buyer consistent with rules that govern the conditions under which a resource can set the wholesale price;
(C) Accounts for the physical and operational characteristics of electric
storage resources through bidding parameters or other means; and
(D) Establishes a minimum size requirement for resources using the participation model for electric storage resources that does not exceed 100 kW.
(ii) The sale of electric energy from an independent system operator or regional transmission organization market to an electric storage resource that the resource then resells back to that market must be at the wholesale locational marginal price.
(10)
Transparency
—(i)
Uplift reporting.
Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must post two reports, at minimum, regarding uplift on a publicly accessible portion of its website. First, each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must post uplift, paid in dollars, and categorized by transmission zone, day, and uplift category. Transmission zone shall be defined as the geographic area that is used for the local allocation of charges. Transmission zones with fewer than four resources may be aggregated with one or more neighboring transmission zones, until each aggregated zone contains at least four resources, and reported collectively. This report shall be posted within 20 calendar days of the end of each month. Second, each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must post the resource name and the total amount of uplift paid in dollars aggregated across the month to each resource that received uplift payments within the calendar month. This report shall be posted within 90 calendar days of the end of each month.
(ii)
Reporting Operator-Initiated Commitments.
Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must post a report of each operator-initiated commitment listing the size of the commitment, transmission zone, commitment reason, and commitment start time on a publicly accessible portion of its website within 30 calendar days of the end of each month. Transmission zone shall be defined as a geographic area that is used for the local allocation of charges. Commitment reasons shall include, but are not limited to, system-wide capacity, constraint management, and voltage support.
(iii)
Transmission constraint penalty factors.
Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must include, in its tariff, its transmission constraint penalty factor values; the circumstances, if any, under which the transmission constraint penalty factors can set locational marginal prices; and the procedure, if any, for temporarily changing the transmission constraint penalty factor values. Any procedure for temporarily changing transmission constraint penalty factor values must provide for notice of the change to market participants.
(11) A resource's incremental energy offer must be capped at the higher of $1,000/MWh or that resource's cost-based incremental energy offer. For the purpose of calculating Locational Marginal Prices, Regional Transmission Organizations and Independent System Operators must cap cost-based incremental energy offers at $2,000/MWh. The actual or expected costs underlying a resource's cost-based incremental energy offer above $1,000/MWh must be verified before that offer can be used for purposes of calculating Locational Marginal Prices. If a resource submits an incremental energy offer above $1,000/MWh and the actual or expected costs underlying that offer cannot be verified before the market clearing process begins, that offer may not be used to calculate Locational Marginal Prices and the resource would be eligible for a make-whole payment if that resource is dispatched and the resource's actual costs are verified after-the-fact. A resource would also be eligible for a make-whole payment if it is dispatched and its verified cost-based incremental energy offer exceeds $2,000/MWh. All resources, regardless of type, are eligible to submit cost-based incremental energy offers in excess of $1,000/MWh.
(12)
Distributed energy resource aggregators.
(i) Each independent system operator and regional transmission organization must have tariff
provisions that allow distributed energy resource aggregations to participate directly in the independent system operator or regional transmission organization markets.
(ii) Each regional transmission organization and independent system operator, to accommodate the participation of distributed energy resource aggregations, must establish market rules that address:
(A) Eligibility to participate in the independent system operator or regional transmission organization markets through a distributed energy resource aggregation;
(B) Locational requirements for distributed energy resource aggregations;
(C) Distribution factors and bidding parameters for distributed energy resource aggregations;
(D) Information and data requirements for distributed energy resource aggregations;
(E) Modification to the list of resources in a distributed energy resource aggregation;
(F) Metering and telemetry system requirements for distributed energy resource aggregations;
(G) Coordination between the regional transmission organization or independent system operator, the distributed energy resource aggregator, the distribution utility, and the relevant electric retail regulatory authorities; and
(H) Market participation agreements for distributed energy resource aggregators.
(iii) Each regional transmission organization and independent system operator must establish a minimum size requirement for distributed energy resource aggregations that does not exceed 100 kW.
(iv) Each regional transmission organization and independent system operator must accept bids from a distributed energy resource aggregator if its aggregation includes distributed energy resources that are customers of utilities that distributed more than 4 million megawatt-hours in the previous fiscal year. An independent system operator or regional transmission organization must not accept bids from a distributed energy resource aggregator if its aggregation includes distributed energy resources that are customers of utilities that distributed 4 million megawatt-hours or less in the previous fiscal year, unless the relevant electric retail regulatory authority permits such customers to be bid into RTO/ISO markets by a distributed energy resource aggregator.
(13)
Transmission line ratings.
(i) Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must establish and maintain systems and procedures necessary to allow any public utility whose transmission facilities are under the independent control of the independent system operator or regional transmission organization to electronically update transmission line ratings for such facilities (for each period for which transmission line ratings are calculated) at least hourly, with such data submitted by those public utility transmission owners directly into the independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's EMS through SCADA or related systems.

# Subpart E—Regulations Governing Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Trust Funds
§ 35.32
General provisions.
(a) If a public utility has elected to provide for the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant through a nuclear plant decommissioning trust fund (Fund), the Fund must meet the following criteria:
(1) The Fund must be an external trust fund in the United States, established pursuant to a written trust agreement, that is independent of the utility, its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates. If the trust fund includes monies collected both in Commission-jurisdictional rates and in non-Commission-jurisdictional rates, then a separate account of the Commission-jurisdictional monies shall be maintained.
(2) The utility may provide overall investment policy to the Trustee or Investment Manager, but it may do so only in writing, and neither the utility nor its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates may serve as Investment Manager or otherwise engage in day-to-day management of the Fund or mandate individual investment decisions.
(3) The Fund's Investment Manager must exercise the standard of care, whether in investing or otherwise, that a prudent investor would use in the same circumstances. The term “prudent investor” means a prudent investor as described in Restatement of the Law (Third), Trusts § 227, including general comments and reporter's notes, pages 8-101. St. Paul, MN: American Law Institute Publishers, (1992). ISBN 0-314-84246-2. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the American Law Institute, 4025 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, and are also available in local law libraries. Copies may be inspected at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Library, Room 95-01, 888 First Street, NE. Washington, DC or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:
http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.
(4) The Trustee shall have a net worth of at least $100 million. In calculating the $100 million net worth requirement, the net worth of the Trustee's parent corporation and/or affiliates may be taken into account only if such entities guarantee the Trustee's responsibilities to the Fund.
(5) The Trustee or Investment Manager shall keep accurate and detailed accounts of all investments, receipts, disbursements and transactions of the Fund. All accounts, books and records relating to the Fund shall be open to inspection and audit at reasonable times by the utility or its designee or by the Commission or its designee. The utility or its designee must notify the Commission prior to performing any such inspection or audit. The Commission may direct the utility to conduct an audit or inspection.
(6) Absent the express authorization of the Commission, no part of the assets of the Fund may be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than to fund the costs of decommissioning the nuclear power plant to which the Fund relates, and to pay administrative costs and other incidental expenses, including taxes, of the Fund.
(7) If the Fund balances exceed the amount actually expended for decommissioning after decommissioning has been completed, the utility shall return the excess jurisdictional amount
to ratepayers, in a manner the Commission determines.
(8) Except for investments tied to market indexes or other mutual funds, the Investment Manager shall not invest in any securities of the utility for which it manages the funds or in that utility's subsidiaries, affiliates, or associates or their successors or assigns.
(9) The utility and the Fiduciary shall seek to obtain the best possible tax treatment of amounts collected for nuclear plant decommissioning. In this regard, the utility and the Fiduciary shall take maximum advantage of tax deductions and credits, when it is consistent with sound business practices to do so.
(10) Each utility shall deposit in the Fund at least quarterly all amounts included in Commission-jurisdictional rates to fund nuclear power plant decommissioning.
(b) The establishment, organization, and maintenance of the Fund shall not relieve the utility or its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates of any obligations it may have as to the decommissioning of the nuclear power plant. It is not the responsibility of the Fiduciary to ensure that the amount of monies that a Fund contains are adequate to pay for a nuclear unit's decommissioning.
(c) A utility may establish both qualified and non-qualified Funds with respect to a utility's interest in a specific nuclear plant. This section applies to both “qualified” (under the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 468A, or any successor section) and non-qualified Funds.
(d) A utility must regularly supply to the Fund's Investment Manager, and regularly update, essential information about the nuclear unit covered by the Trust Fund Agreement, including its description, location, expected remaining useful life, the decommissioning plan the utility proposes to follow, the utility's liquidity needs once decommissioning begins, and any other information that the Fund's Investment Manager would need to construct and maintain, over time, a sound investment plan.
(e) A utility should monitor the performance of all Fiduciaries of the Fund and, if necessary, replace them if they are not properly performing assigned responsibilities.
[Order 580-A, 62 FR 33348, June 19, 1997, as amended at 69 FR 18803, Apr. 9, 2004]
§ 35.33
Specific provisions.
(a) In addition to the general provisions of § 35.32, the Trustee must observe the provisions of this section.
(b) The Trustee may use Fund assets only to:
(1) Satisfy the liability of a utility for decommissioning costs of the nuclear power plant to which the Fund relates as provided by § 35.32; and
(2) Pay administrative costs and other incidental expenses, including taxes, of the Fund as provided by § 35.32.
(c) To the extent that the Trustee does not currently require the assets of the Fund for the purposes described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the Investment Manager, when investing Fund assets, must exercise the same standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the same circumstances. In this context, a “reasonable person” means a prudent investor as described in Restatement of the Law (Third), Trusts § 227, including general comments and reporter's notes, pages 8-101. St. Paul, MN: American Law Institute Publishers, 1992. ISBN 0-314-84246-2.

For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:
http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/cfr/ibr-locations.html.
(d) The utility must submit to the Commission by March 31 of each year, one original and three conformed copies of the financial report furnished to the utility by the Fund's Trustee that shows for the previous calendar year:
(1) Fund assets and liabilities at the beginning of the period;
(2) Activity of the Fund during the period, including amounts received from the utility, a summary amount for purchases of fund investments and a summary amount for sales of fund investments, gains and losses from investment activity, disbursements from the Fund for decommissioning activity and payment of Fund expenses, including taxes; and
(3) Fund assets and liabilities at the end of the period. The report should not include the liability for decommissioning.
(4) Public utilities owning nuclear plants must maintain records of individual purchase and sales transactions until after decommissioning has been completed and any excess jurisdictional amounts have been returned to ratepayers in a manner that the Commission determines. The public utility need not include these records in the financial report that it furnishes to the Commission by March 31 of each year.
(e) The utility must also mail a copy of the financial report provided to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section to anyone who requests it.
(f) If an independent public accountant has expressed an opinion on the report or on any portion of the report, then that opinion must accompany the report.

# Subpart G—Transmission Infrastructure Investment Provisions
§ 35.35
Transmission infrastructure investment.
(a)
Purpose.
This section establishes rules for incentive-based (including performance-based) rate treatments for transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce by public utilities for the purpose of benefiting consumers by ensuring reliability and reducing the cost of delivered power by reducing transmission congestion.
(b)
Definitions.
(1)
Transco
means a stand-alone transmission company that has been approved by the Commission and that sells transmission services at wholesale and/or on an unbundled retail basis, regardless of whether it is affiliated with another public utility.
(2)
Transmission Organization
means a Regional Transmission Organization, Independent System Operator, independent transmission provider, or other transmission organization finally approved by the Commission for the operation of transmission facilities.
(c)
General rule.
All rates approved under the rules of this section, including any revisions to the rules, are subject to the filing requirements of sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act and to the substantive requirements of sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act that all rates, charges, terms and conditions be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.
(d)
Incentive-based rate treatments for transmission infrastructure investment.
The Commission will authorize any incentive-based rate treatment, as discussed in this paragraph (d), for transmission infrastructure investment, provided that the proposed incentive-based rate treatment is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. A public utility's request for one or more incentive-based rate treatments, to be made in a filing pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act, or in a petition for a declaratory order that precedes a filing pursuant to section 205, must include a detailed explanation of how the proposed rate treatment complies with the requirements of section 219 of the Federal Power Act and a demonstration that the proposed rate treatment is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. The applicant must demonstrate that the facilities for which it seeks incentives either ensure reliability or reduce the cost of delivered power by reducing transmission congestion consistent with the requirements of section 219, that the
total
package of incentives is tailored to address the demonstrable risks or challenges faced by the applicant in undertaking the project, and that resulting rates are just and reasonable. For purposes of this paragraph (d), incentive-based rate treatment means any of the following:
(1) For purposes of this paragraph (d), incentive-based rate treatment means any of the following:
(i) A rate of return on equity sufficient to attract new investment in transmission facilities;
(ii) 100 percent of prudently incurred Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) in rate base;
(iii) Recovery of prudently incurred pre-commercial operations costs;
(iv) Hypothetical capital structure;
(v) Accelerated depreciation used for rate recovery;
(vi) Recovery of 100 percent of prudently incurred costs of transmission facilities that are cancelled or abandoned due to factors beyond the control of the public utility;
(vii) Deferred cost recovery; and
(viii) Any other incentives approved by the Commission, pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph, that are determined to be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.
(2) In addition to the incentives in § 35.35(d)(1), the Commission will authorize the following incentive-based rate treatments for Transcos, provided that the proposed incentive-based rate treatment is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential:
(i) A return on equity that both encourages Transco formation and is sufficient to attract investment; and
(ii) An adjustment to the book value of transmission assets being sold to a
Transco to remove the disincentive associated with the impact of accelerated depreciation on federal capital gains tax liabilities.
(e)
Incentives for joining a Transmission Organization.
The Commission will authorize an incentive-based rate treatment, as discussed in this paragraph (e), for public utilities that join a Transmission Organization, if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed incentive-based rate treatment is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. Applicants for the incentive-based rate treatment must make a filing with the Commission under section 205 of the Federal Power Act. For purposes of this paragraph (e), an incentive-based rate treatment means a return on equity that is higher than the return on equity the Commission might otherwise allow if the public utility did not join a Transmission Organization. The Commission will also permit transmitting utilities or electric utilities that join a Transmission Organization the ability to recover prudently incurred costs associated with joining the Transmission Organization, either through transmission rates charged by transmitting utilities or electric utilities or through transmission rates charged by the Transmission Organization that provides services to such utilities.
(f)
Approval of prudently-incurred costs.
The Commission will approve recovery of prudently-incurred costs necessary to comply with the mandatory reliability standards pursuant to section 215 of the Federal Power Act, provided that the proposed rates are just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.
(g)
Approval of prudently incurred costs related to transmission infrastructure development.
The Commission will approve recovery of prudently-incurred costs related to transmission infrastructure development pursuant to section 216 of the Federal Power Act, provided that the proposed rates are just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.
(h)
FERC-730, Report of transmission investment activity.
Public utilities that have been granted incentive rate treatment for specific transmission projects must file FERC-730 on an annual basis beginning with the calendar year incentive rate treatment is granted by the Commission. Such filings are due by April 18 of the following calendar year and are due April 18 each year thereafter. The following information must be filed:
(1) In dollar terms, actual transmission investment for the most recent calendar year, and projected, incremental investments for the next five calendar years;
(2) For all current and projected investments over the next five calendar years, a project by project listing that specifies for each project the most up-to-date, expected completion date, percentage completion as of the date of filing, and reasons for delays. Exclude from this listing projects with projected costs less than $20 million; and
(3) For good cause shown, the Commission may extend the time within which any FERC-730 filing is to be filed or waive the requirements applicable to any such filing.
(i)
Rebuttable presumption.
(1) The Commission will apply a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has demonstrated that its project is needed to ensure reliability or reduces the cost of delivered power by reducing congestion for:
(i) A transmission project that results from a fair and open regional planning process that considers and evaluates projects for reliability and/or congestion and is found to be acceptable to the Commission; or
(ii) A project that has received construction approval from an appropriate state commission or state siting authority.
(2) To the extent these approval processes do not require that a project ensures reliability or reduce the cost of delivered power by reducing congestion, the applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that its project satisfies these criteria.
(j)
Commission authorization to site electric transmission facilities in interstate commerce.
If the Commission pursuant to its authority under section 216 of the Federal Power Act and its regulations
thereunder has issued one or more permits for the construction or modification of transmission facilities in a national interest electric transmission corridor designated by the Secretary, such facilities shall be deemed to either ensure reliability or reduce the cost of delivered power by reducing congestion for purposes of section 219(a).

§ 35.37
Market power analysis required.
(a)(1) In addition to other requirements in subparts A and B, a Seller must submit a market power analysis in the following circumstances: When seeking market-based rate authority; for Category 2 Sellers, every three years, according to the schedule posted on the Commission's website; or any other time the Commission directs a Seller to submit one. Failure to timely file an updated market power analysis will constitute a violation of Seller's market-based rate tariff. The market power analysis must be preceded by a submission of information into a relational database that will include a list of the Seller's own assets, the assets of its non-market-based rate affiliate(s) and identification of its ultimate upstream affiliate(s). The relational database submission will also include information necessary to generate the indicative screens, if necessary, as discussed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. When seeking market-based rate authority, the relational database submission must also include other market-based information concerning category status, operating reserves authorization, mitigation, and other limitations.
(2) When submitting a market power analysis, whether as part of an initial application or an update, a Seller must include a description of its ownership structure that identifies all ultimate upstream affiliate(s). With respect to any investors or owners that a Seller represents to be passive, the Seller must affirm in its narrative that the ownership interests consist solely of passive rights that are necessary to protect the passive investors' or owners' investments and do not confer control. The Seller must also include an appendix of assets and, if necessary, indicative screens as discussed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A Seller must include all supporting materials referenced in the indicative screens. The appendix of assets and indicative screens are derived from the information submitted by a Seller and its affiliates into the relational database and retrievable in conformance with the instructions posted on the Commission's website.
(b) A market power analysis must address whether a Seller has horizontal and vertical market power.
(c)(1) There will be a rebuttable presumption that a Seller lacks horizontal market power with respect to sales of energy, capacity, energy imbalance service, generation imbalance service, and primary frequency response service if it passes two indicative market power screens: a pivotal supplier analysis based on annual peak demand of the relevant market, and a market share analysis applied on a seasonal basis. There will be a rebuttable presumption that a Seller lacks horizontal market power with respect to sales of operating reserve-spinning and operating reserve-supplemental services if the Seller passes these two indicative market power screens and demonstrates in its market-based rate application how the scheduling practices in its region support the delivery of operating reserve resources from one balancing authority area to another. There will be a rebuttable presumption that a Seller possesses horizontal market power with respect to sales of energy, capacity, energy imbalance service, generation imbalance service, operating reserve-spinning service, operating reserve-supplemental service,
and primary frequency response service if it fails either screen.
(2) Sellers and intervenors may also file alternative evidence to support or rebut the results of the indicative screens. Sellers may file such evidence at the time they file their indicative screens. Intervenors may file such evidence in response to a Seller's submissions.
(3) If a Seller does not pass one or both screens, the Seller may rebut a presumption of horizontal market power by submitting a Delivered Price Test analysis. A Seller that does not rebut a presumption of horizontal market power or that concedes market power, is subject to mitigation, as described in § 35.38.
(4) In lieu of submitting the indicative market power screens, Sellers studying regional transmission organization (RTO) or independent system operator (ISO) markets that operate RTO/ISO-administered energy, ancillary services, and capacity markets may state that they are relying on Commission-approved market monitoring and mitigation to address potential horizontal market power Sellers may have in those markets.
(5) In lieu of submitting the indicative market power screens, Sellers studying RTO or ISO markets that operate RTO/ISO-administered energy and ancillary services markets, but not capacity markets, may state that they are relying on Commission-approved market monitoring and mitigation to address potential horizontal market power that Sellers may have in energy and ancillary services. However, Sellers studying such RTOs/ISOs would need to submit indicative market power screens if they wish to obtain market-based rate authority for wholesale sales of capacity in these markets.
(6) Sellers submitting simultaneous transmission import limit studies must file Submittal 1, and, if applicable, Submittal 2, in the electronic spreadsheet format provided on the Commission's Web site.
(d) To demonstrate a lack of vertical market power, a Seller that owns, operates or controls transmission facilities, or whose affiliates own, operate or control transmission facilities, must have on file with the Commission an Open Access Transmission Tariff, as described in § 35.28; provided, however, that a Seller whose foreign affiliate(s) own, operate or control transmission facilities outside of the United States that can be used by competitors of the Seller to reach United States markets must demonstrate that such affiliate either has adopted and is implementing an Open Access Transmission Tariff as described in § 35.28, or otherwise offers comparable, non-discriminatory access to such transmission facilities.
(e) To demonstrate a lack of vertical market power in wholesale energy markets through the affiliation, ownership or control of inputs to electric power production, such as the transportation or distribution of the inputs to electric power production, a Seller must provide the following information:
(1) A description of its ownership or control of, or affiliation with an entity that owns or controls, intrastate natural gas transportation, intrastate natural gas storage or distribution facilities;
(2) Physical coal supply sources and ownership or control over who may access transportation of coal supplies; and
(3) A Seller must ensure that this information is included in the record of each new application for market-based rates and each updated market power analysis. In addition, a Seller is required to make an affirmative statement that it and its affiliates have not erected barriers to entry into the relevant market and will not erect barriers to entry into the relevant market.
(f) If the Seller seeks to protect any portion of a filing from public disclosure, the Seller must make its filing in accordance with the Commission's instructions for filing privileged materials and critical energy infrastructure information in § 388.112 of this chapter.
[Order 697, 72 FR 40038, July 20, 2007, as amended by Order 697-B, 73 FR 79627, Dec. 30, 2008; Order 769, 77 FR 65475, Oct. 29, 2012; Order 784, 78 FR 46209, July 30, 2013; Order 816, 80 FR 67108, Oct. 30, 2015; Order 819, 80 FR 73977, Nov. 27, 2015; Order 861, 84 FR 36386, July 26, 2019; Order 860, 84 FR 36428, July 26, 2019]
§ 35.38
Mitigation.
(a) A Seller that has been found to have market power in generation or ancillary services, or that is presumed to have horizontal market power in generation or ancillary services by virtue of failing or foregoing the relevant market power screens, as described in 35.37(c), may adopt the default mitigation detailed in paragraph (b) of this section for sales of energy or capacity or paragraph (c) of this section for sales of ancillary services or may propose mitigation tailored to its own particular circumstances to eliminate its ability to exercise market power. Mitigation will apply only to the market(s) in which the Seller is found, or presumed, to have market power.
(b) Default mitigation for sales of energy or capacity consists of three distinct products:
(1) Sales of power of one week or less priced at the Seller's incremental cost plus a 10 percent adder;
(2) Sales of power of more than one week but less than one year priced at no higher than a cost-based ceiling reflecting the costs of the unit(s) expected to provide the service; and
(3) New contracts filed for review under section 205 of the Federal Power Act for sales of power for one year or more priced at a rate not to exceed embedded cost of service.
(c) Default mitigation for sales of ancillary services consist of: (1) A cap based on the relevant OATT ancillary service rate of the purchasing transmission operator; or (2) the results of a competitive solicitation that meets the Commission's requirements for transparency, definition, evaluation, and competitiveness.

§ 35.39
Affiliate restrictions.
(a)
General affiliate provisions.
As a condition of obtaining and retaining market-based rate authority, the conditions provided in this section, including the restriction on affiliate sales of electric energy and all other affiliate provisions, must be satisfied on an ongoing basis, unless otherwise authorized by Commission rule or order. Failure to satisfy these conditions will constitute a violation of the Seller's market-based rate tariff.
(b)
Restriction on affiliate sales of electric energy or capacity.
As a condition of obtaining and retaining market-based rate authority, no wholesale sale of electric energy or capacity may be made between a franchised public utility with captive customers and a market-regulated power sales affiliate without first receiving Commission authorization for the transaction under section 205 of the Federal Power Act. All authorizations to engage in affiliate wholesale sales of electric energy or capacity must be listed in a Seller's market-based rate tariff.
(c)
Separation of functions.
(1) For the purpose of this paragraph, entities acting on behalf of and for the benefit of a franchised public utility with captive customers (such as entities controlling or marketing power from the electrical generation assets of the franchised public utility) are considered part of the franchised public utility. Entities acting on behalf of and for the benefit of the market-regulated power sales affiliates of a franchised public utility with captive customers are considered part of the market-regulated power sales affiliates.
(2) (i) To the maximum extent practical, the employees of a market-regulated power sales affiliate must operate separately from the employees of any affiliated franchised public utility with captive customers.
(ii) Franchised public utilities with captive customers are permitted to share support employees, and field and maintenance employees with their market-regulated power sales affiliates. Franchised public utilities with captive customers are also permitted to share senior officers and boards of directors with their market-regulated power sales affiliates; provided, however, that the shared officers and boards of directors must not participate in directing, organizing or executing generation or market functions.
(iii) Notwithstanding any other restrictions in this section, in emergency circumstances affecting system reliability, a market-regulated power sales affiliate and a franchised public utility with captive customers may take steps
necessary to keep the bulk power system in operation. A franchised public utility with captive customers or the market-regulated power sales affiliate must report to the Commission and disclose to the public on its Web site, each emergency that resulted in any deviation from the restrictions of section 35.39, within 24 hours of such deviation.
(d)
Information sharing.
(1) A franchised public utility with captive customers may not share market information with a market-regulated power sales affiliate if the sharing could be used to the detriment of captive customers, unless simultaneously disclosed to the public.
(2) Permissibly shared support employees, field and maintenance employees and senior officers and board of directors under §§ 35.39(c)(2)(ii) may have access to information covered by the prohibition of § 35.39(d)(1), subject to the no-conduit provision in § 35.39(g).
(e)
Non-power goods or services.
(1) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, sales of any non-power goods or services by a franchised public utility with captive customers, to a market-regulated power sales affiliate must be at the higher of cost or market price.
(2) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, sales of any non-power goods or services by a market-regulated power sales affiliate to an affiliated franchised public utility with captive customers may not be at a price above market.
(f)
Brokering of power.
(1) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, to the extent a market-regulated power sales affiliate seeks to broker power for an affiliated franchised public utility with captive customers:
(i) The market-regulated power sales affiliate must offer the franchised public utility's power first;
(ii) The arrangement between the market-regulated power sales affiliate and the franchised public utility must be non-exclusive; and
(iii) The market-regulated power sales affiliate may not accept any fees in conjunction with any brokering services it performs for an affiliated franchised public utility.
(2) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, to the extent a franchised public utility with captive customers seeks to broker power for a market-regulated power sales affiliate:
(i) The franchised public utility must charge the higher of its costs for the service or the market price for such services;
(ii) The franchised public utility must market its own power first, and simultaneously make public (on the Internet) any market information shared with its affiliate during the brokering; and
(iii) The franchised public utility must post on the Internet the actual brokering charges imposed.
(g)

§ 35.40
Ancillary services.
A Seller may make sales of ancillary services at market-based rates only if it has been authorized by the Commission and only in specific geographic markets as the Commission has authorized.
§ 35.41
Market behavior rules.
(a)
Unit operation.
Where a Seller participates in a Commission-approved organized market, Seller must operate and schedule generating facilities, undertake maintenance, declare outages, and commit or otherwise bid supply in a manner that complies with the Commission-approved rules and regulations of the applicable market. A Seller is not required to bid or supply electric
energy or other electricity products unless such requirement is a part of a separate Commission-approved tariff or is a requirement applicable to Seller through Seller's participation in a Commission-approved organized market.
(b)
Communications.
A Seller must provide accurate and factual information and not submit false or misleading information, or omit material information, in any communication with the Commission, Commission-approved market monitors, Commission-approved regional transmission organizations, Commission-approved independent system operators, or jurisdictional transmission providers, unless Seller exercises due diligence to prevent such occurrences.
(c)
Price reporting.
To the extent a Seller engages in reporting of transactions to publishers of electric or natural gas price indices, Seller must provide accurate and factual information, and not knowingly submit false or misleading information or omit material information to any such publisher, by reporting its transactions in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth in the
Policy Statement on Natural Gas and Electric Price Indices,
issued by the Commission in Docket No. PL03-3-000, and any clarifications thereto. Seller must identify as part of its Electric Quarterly Report filing requirement in § 35.10b of this chapter the publishers of electricity and natural gas indices to which it reports its transactions. In addition, Seller must adhere to any other standards and requirements for price reporting as the Commission may order.
(d)
Records retention.
A Seller must retain, for a period of five years, all data and information upon which it billed the prices it charged for the electric energy or electric energy products it sold pursuant to Seller's market-based rate tariff, and the prices it reported for use in price indices.
[Order 697, 72 FR 40038, July 20, 2007, as amended by Order 768, 77 FR 61924, Oct. 11, 2012]
§ 35.42
Change in status reporting requirement.
(a) As a condition of obtaining and retaining market-based rate authority, a Seller must timely report to the Commission any change in status that would reflect a departure from the characteristics the Commission relied upon in granting market-based rate authority. A change in status includes, but is not limited to, the following:
(1) Ownership or control of generation capacity or long-term firm purchases of capacity and/or energy that results in cumulative net increases (
i.e.,
the difference between increases and decreases in affiliated generation capacity) of 100 MW or more of capacity based on nameplate or seasonal capacity ratings, or, for solar photovoltaic facilities, nameplate capacity, or, for other energy-limited resources, nameplate or five-year average capacity factors, in any individual relevant geographic market, or of inputs to electric power production, or ownership, operation or control of transmission facilities; or
(2) Affiliation with any entity not disclosed in the application for market-based rate authority that:
(i) Owns or controls generation facilities or has long-term firm purchases of capacity and/or energy that results in cumulative net increases (
i.e.,
the difference between increases and decreases in affiliated generation capacity) of 100 MW or more of capacity based on nameplate or seasonal capacity ratings, or, for solar photovoltaic facilities, nameplate capacity, or, for other energy-limited resources, nameplate or five-year average capacity factors, in any individual relevant geographic market;
(ii) Owns or controls inputs to electric power production;
(iii) Owns, operates or controls transmission facilities;
(iv) Has a franchised service area; or
(v) Is an ultimate upstream affiliate.
(b) Any change in status subject to paragraph (a) of this section must be filed quarterly. Power sales contracts with future delivery are reportable once the physical delivery has begun. Sellers shall file change in status in accordance with the following schedule: For the period from January 1 through March 31, file by April 30; for the period from April 1 through June 30, file by July 31; for the period July 1 through September 30, file by October 31; and
for the period October 1 through December 31, file by January 31. Failure to timely file a change in status constitutes a tariff violation.
(c) Changes in status must be prepared in conformance with the instructions posted on the Commission's website.
(d) A Seller must report on a monthly basis changes to its previously-submitted relational database information, excluding updates to the horizontal market power screens. These submissions must be made by the 15th day of the month following the change. The submission must be prepared in conformance with the instructions posted on the Commission's website.

(B) Any company 10 percent or more of whose outstanding voting securities are owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, directly or indirectly, by the specified company;
(C) Any person or class of persons that the Commission determines, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, to stand in such relation to the specified company that there is liable to be an absence of arm's-length bargaining in transactions between them as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that the person be treated as an affiliate; and
(D) Any person that is under common control with the specified company.
(E) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, owning, controlling or holding with power to vote, less than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of a specified company creates a rebuttable presumption of lack of control.
(ii) For any exempt wholesale generator (as defined under § 366.1 of this chapter), consistent with section 214 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824m), which provides that “affiliate” will have the same meaning as provided in section 2(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79b(a)(11)):

(2)
Captive customers
means any wholesale or retail electric energy customers served by a franchised public utility under cost-based regulation.
(3)
Franchised public utility
means a public utility with a franchised service obligation under state law.
(4)
Market-regulated power sales affiliate
means any power seller affiliate other than a franchised public utility, including a power marketer, exempt wholesale generator, qualifying facility or other power seller affiliate, whose
power sales are regulated in whole or in part on a market-rate basis.
(5)
Non-utility affiliate
means any affiliate that is not in the power sales or transmission business, other than a local gas distribution company or an interstate natural gas pipeline.
(b) The provisions of this subpart apply to all franchised public utilities that have captive customers or that own or provide transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities.
§ 35.44
Protections against affiliate cross-subsidization.
(a)
Restriction on affiliate sales of electric energy.
No wholesale sale of electric energy may be made between a franchised public utility with captive customers and a market-regulated power sales affiliate without first receiving Commission authorization for the transaction under section 205 of the Federal Power Act. This requirement does not apply to energy sales from a qualifying facility, as defined by 18 CFR 292.101, made under market-based rate authority granted by the Commission.
(b)
Non-power goods or services.
(1) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, and except as permitted by paragraph (b)(4) of this section, sales of any non-power goods or services by a franchised public utility that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, including sales made to or through its affiliated exempt wholesale generators or qualifying facilities, to a market-regulated power sales affiliate or non-utility affiliate must be at the higher of cost or market price.
(2) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, and except as permitted by paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, a franchised public utility that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, may not purchase or receive non-power goods and services from a market-regulated power sales affiliate or a non-utility affiliate at a price above market.
(3) A franchised public utility that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, may only purchase or receive non-power goods and services from a centralized service company at cost.
(4) A company in a single-state holding company system, as defined in § 366.3(c)(1) of this chapter, may provide general administrative and management non-power goods and services to, or receive such goods and services from, other companies in the same holding company system, at cost, provided that the only parties to transactions involving these non-power goods and services are affiliates or associate companies, as defined in § 366.1 of this chapter, of a holding company in the holding company system.
(c)
Exemption for price under fuel adjustment clause regulations.
Where the price of fuel from a company-owned or controlled source is found or presumed under § 35.14 to be reasonable and includable in the adjustment clause, transactions involving that fuel shall be exempt from the affiliate price restrictions in § 35.44(b).

This section establishes rules for incentive-based rate treatments for utilities with rates on file with the Commission that voluntarily make cybersecurity investments as described in this section.
(b)
Definitions.
As used in this section:
Advanced Cybersecurity Technology
means any technology, operational capability, or service, including computer hardware, software, or a related
asset, that enhances the security posture of public utilities through improvements in the ability to protect against, detect, respond to, or recover from a cybersecurity threat (as defined in section 102 of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 (6 U.S.C. 1501)).
Advanced Cybersecurity Technology Information
means information relating to Advanced Cybersecurity Technology or proposed Advanced Cybersecurity Technology that is generated by or provided to the Commission or another Federal agency. Pursuant to FPA section 219A(g), Advanced Cybersecurity Technology Information is considered to be Critical Electric Infrastructure Information.

has the same meaning as defined in 18 CFR 388.113.
Electric Reliability Organization
has the same meaning as defined in § 39.1 of this subchapter.
Reliability Standard
has the same meaning as defined in § 39.1 of this subchapter.
(c)
Incentive-based rate treatment for cybersecurity investment.
The Commission will authorize incentive-based rate treatment for a utility that voluntarily makes an investment in Advanced Cybersecurity Technology and for a utility that voluntarily participates in a cybersecurity threat information sharing program under this section, provided that the utility meets the requirements of this section and the utility demonstrates that the resulting rate is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential, as required by sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act. Incentive-based rate treatment is available to both public and non-public utilities that have or will have a rate on file with the Commission. A utility may request a single incentive-based rate treatment as specified in paragraph (f) of this section for an eligible cybersecurity investment that meets the eligibility criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Eligibility criteria.
Pursuant to paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section, a utility may receive incentive-based rate treatment for a cybersecurity investment that:
(1) Materially improves cybersecurity through either Advanced Cybersecurity Technology or participation in a cybersecurity threat information sharing program; and
(2) Is not already mandated by the Reliability Standards as maintained by the Electric Reliability Organization, or otherwise mandated by local, State, or Federal law, decision, or directive; otherwise legally mandated; or an action taken in response to a Federal or State agency merger condition, consent decree from Federal or State agency, or settlement agreement that resolves a dispute between a utility and a public or private party.
(e)
Demonstrating satisfaction of the eligibility criteria.
A utility shall demonstrate to the Commission that a proposed cybersecurity investment satisfies the eligibility criteria in paragraph (d) of this section. Such demonstration shall show that the cybersecurity investment fulfills at least one of the provisions in the following paragraphs (e)(1) through (3):
(1) A utility shall demonstrate that a cybersecurity investment qualifies as one or more of the pre-qualified cybersecurity investments. The Commission shall rebuttably presume that pre-qualified cybersecurity investments satisfy the eligibility criteria. The Commission shall maintain a list on its website of pre-qualified cybersecurity investments and shall update such list from time to time either subject to notice and comment procedures or in a rulemaking.
(2) A utility shall demonstrate that a cybersecurity investment satisfies each of the eligibility criteria in paragraph (d) of this section. The Commission shall not presume that such demonstration satisfies the eligibility criteria.
(3) A utility shall demonstrate that it will make cybersecurity investments to comply with a Reliability Standard that is approved by the Commission but has not yet taken effect as approved by the Commission. The Commission shall not presume that such demonstration satisfies the eligibility criteria. Any incentives authorized by the Commission pursuant to this section shall terminate when the Reliability Standard takes effect.
(f)
Types of incentive-based rate treatment for cybersecurity investment.
For purposes of this section, incentive-based rate treatment shall mean deferral of expenses as a regulatory asset.
(g)
Incentive duration.
(1) A deferred Advanced Cybersecurity Technology regulatory asset whose costs are typically expensed shall be:
(i) Amortized over a period of up to five years;
(ii) Limited to expenses incurred in the first five years following Commission approval of the incentive;
(iii) Limited to ongoing expenses that the applicable utility was not already undertaking more than three months prior to filing an incentive request; and
(iv) Terminated when the cybersecurity investment or activity that serves as the basis of that incentive becomes mandatory.
(2) An incentive granted for participation in a qualified cybersecurity threat information sharing program will not be subject to the five-year duration limitation provisions of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section for as long as the utility participates in the qualified cybersecurity threat information sharing program and such participation is not mandatory as to the utility. A utility participating in a qualified cybersecurity threat information sharing program is eligible to continue deferring expenses associated with such participation, which for each year would be amortized over the next five years.
(h)
Incentive applications.
For the purpose of this section, a utility's request for incentive based-rate treatments for one or more cybersecurity investments must be made in a filing pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act, or in a petition for a declaratory order that precedes a filing pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act. Utilities may file such a request either as a part of a general rate request or on a single-issue basis. Such a request shall include a detailed explanation to include the following information:
(1) A demonstration that the cybersecurity investment satisfies the eligibility criteria, which includes an attestation that cybersecurity investment is not mandatory, as required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and that the resulting rate is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential;
(2) A detailed description of relevant cybersecurity expenses, including whether such cybersecurity expenses are:
(i) Associated with third-party provision of hardware, software, computing networking services, and/or cybersecurity monitoring services;
(ii) For training to implement network analysis and monitoring programs, and/or other cybersecurity protocols; and/or
(iii) Other cybersecurity expenses;
(3) Estimates of the cost of such cybersecurity expenses;
(4) When the cybersecurity expenses are expected to be incurred; and
(5) An attestation that the utility either has not already been undertaking duplicative or materially the same expenses for more than three months or that the utility is participating in a cybersecurity threat information-sharing program for the expense at issue. In the case of cybersecurity investments made to comply with a Reliability Standard that is approved by the Commission but has not yet taken effect as approved by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the utility must attest that it has not already been undertaking duplicative or materially the same expenses for more than three months prior to the date that the Commission's approval of the Reliability Standard becomes effective.
(i)
Reporting requirements.
A utility that has received Commission approval for incentive-based rate treatment under this section shall make an annual informational filing on June 1, provided that the utility has received such Commission approval at least 60 days prior to June 1 of that year. A utility that receives Commission approval of an incentive-based rate treatment under this section later than 60 days prior to June 1 shall submit an annual informational filing beginning on June 1 of the following year. The annual filing shall detail the specific cybersecurity investments that were made pursuant to the Commission's approval and the corresponding FERC account used. The annual informational
filing shall describe the deferred expenses in sufficient detail to demonstrate that such expenses are specifically related to the cybersecurity investment granted incentives and not for ongoing services including system maintenance, surveillance, and other labor costs. Utilities shall provide a detailed description of any material changes in the nature of such expenses from prior year informational filings.
(j)
Transmittal of CEII in incentive applications and annual reports.
As appropriate, any CEII submitted to the Commission in a utility's incentive application made pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section or contained in its reporting requirements made pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section shall be filed consistent with part 388 of this title.

§ 37.4
[Reserved]
§ 37.5
Obligations of Transmission Providers and Responsible Parties.
(a) Each Transmission Provider is required to provide for the operation of an OASIS, either individually or jointly with other Transmission Providers, in accordance with the requirements of this Part. The Transmission Provider may delegate this responsibility to a Responsible Party such as another Transmission Provider, an Independent System Operator, a Regional Transmission Group, or a Regional Reliability Council.
(b) A Responsible Party must provide access to an OASIS providing standardized information relevant to the availability of transmission capacity, prices, and other information (as described in this part) pertaining to the transmission system for which it is responsible.
(c) A Responsible Party may not deny or restrict access to an OASIS user merely because that user makes automated computer-to-computer file transfers or queries, or extensive requests for data.
(d) In the event that an OASIS user's grossly inefficient method of accessing an OASIS node or obtaining information from the node seriously degrades the performance of the node, a Responsible Party may limit a user's access to the OASIS node without prior Commission approval. The Responsible Party must immediately contact the OASIS
user to resolve the problem. Notification of the restriction must be made to the Commission within two business days of the incident and include a description of the problem. A closure report describing how the problem was resolved must be filed with the Commission within one week of the incident.
(e) In the event that an OASIS user makes an error in a query, the Responsible Party can block the affected query and notify the user of the nature of the error.

(1)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section the terms listed below have the following meanings:
(i)
Posted path
means any control area to control area interconnection; any path for which service is denied, curtailed or interrupted for more than 24 hours in the past 12 months; and any path for which a customer requests to have ATC or TTC posted. For this last category, the posting must continue for 180 days and thereafter until 180 days have elapsed from the most recent request for service over the requested path. For purposes of this definition, an hour includes any part of an hour during which service was denied, curtailed or interrupted.
(ii)
Constrained posted path
means any posted path having an ATC less than or equal to 25 percent of TTC at any time during the preceding 168 hours or for which ATC has been calculated to be less than or equal to 25 percent of TTC for any period during the current hour or the next 168 hours.
(iii)
Unconstrained posted path
means any posted path not determined to be a constrained posted path.
(iv) The word
interconnection,
as used in the definition of “posted path”, means all facilities connecting two adjacent systems or control areas.
(v)
Available transfer capability
or
ATC
means the transfer capability remaining in the physical transmission network for further commercial activity over and above already committed uses, or such definition as contained in Commission-approved Reliability Standards.
(vi)
Total transfer capability
or
TTC
means the amount of electric power that can be moved or transferred reliably from one area to another area of
the interconnected transmission systems by way of all transmission lines (or paths) between those areas under specified system conditions, or such definition as contained in Commission-approved Reliability Standards.
(vii)
Capacity Benefit Margin
or
CBM
means the amount of TTC preserved by the Transmission Provider for load-serving entities, whose loads are located on that Transmission Provider's system, to enable access by the load-serving entities to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements, or such definition as contained in Commission-approved Reliability Standards.
(viii)
Transmission Reliability Margin
or
TRM
means the amount of TTC necessary to provide reasonable assurance that the interconnected transmission network will be secure, or such definition as contained in Commission-approved Reliability Standards.
(2)
Calculation methods, availability of information, and requests.

Such calculations shall be conducted in a manner that is transparent, consistent with anticipated system conditions and outages for the relevant timeframe, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.
(ii) On request, the Responsible Party must make all data used to calculate ATC, TTC, CBM, and TRM for any constrained posted paths publicly available (including the limiting element(s) and the cause of the limit (
e.g.
, thermal, voltage, stability), as well as load forecast assumptions) in electronic form within one week of the posting. The information is required to be provided only in the electronic format in which it was created, along with any necessary decoding instructions, at a cost limited to the cost of reproducing the material. This information is to be retained for six months after the applicable posting period.
(iii) System planning studies, facilities studies, and specific network impact studies performed for customers or the Transmission Provider's own network resources are to be made publicly available in electronic form on request and a list of such studies shall be posted on the OASIS. A study is required to be provided only in the electronic format in which it was created, along with any necessary decoding instructions, at a cost limited to the cost of reproducing the material. These studies are to be retained for five years.

Notice to audited person.
(a)
Applicability.
This part applies to all audits conducted by the Commission or its staff under authority of the Federal Power Act except for Electric Reliability Organization audits conducted pursuant to the authority of part 39 of the Commission's regulations.
(b)
Notice.
An audit conducted by the Commission's staff under authority of the Federal Power Act may result in a notice of deficiency or audit report or similar document containing a finding or findings that the audited person has not complied with a requirement of the Commission with respect to, but not limited to, the following: A filed tariff or tariffs, contracts, data, records, accounts, books, communications or papers relevant to the audit of the audited person; matters under the Standards of Conduct or the Code of Conduct; and the activities or operations of the audited person. The notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document may also contain one or more proposed remedies that address findings of noncompliance. Where such findings, with or without proposed remedies, appear in a notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document, such document shall be provided to the audited person, and the finding or findings, and any proposed remedies, shall be noted and explained. The audited person shall timely indicate in a written response any and all findings or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagrees. The audited person shall have 15 days from the date it is sent the notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document to provide a written response to the audit staff indicating any and all findings or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagrees, and such further time as the audit staff may provide in writing to the audited person at the time the document is sent to the audited person. The audited person may move the Commission for additional time to provide a written response to the audit staff and such motion shall be granted for good cause shown. Any initial order that the Commission subsequently may issue with respect to the notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document shall note, but not address on the merits, the finding or findings, or the proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagreed. The Commission shall provide the audited person 30 days to respond to the initial Commission order concerning a notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document with respect to the finding or findings or any proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which it disagreed.
[Order 675-A, 71 FR 29784, May 24, 2006]
§ 41.2
Response to notification.
Upon issuance of a Commission order that notes a finding or findings, or proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in
any combination, with which the audited person has disagreed, the audited person may: Acquiesce in the findings and/or proposed remedies by not timely responding to the Commission order, in which case the Commission may issue an order approving them or taking other action; or challenge the finding or findings and/or any proposed remedies, with which it disagreed by timely notifying the Commission in writing that it requests Commission review by means of a shortened procedure or, if there are material facts in dispute which require cross-examination, a trial-type hearing.
[Order 675, 71 FR 9706, Feb. 27, 2006]
§ 41.3
Shortened procedure.
If the audited person subject to a Commission order described in § 41.1 notifies the Commission that it seeks to challenge one or more audit findings, or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, by the shortened procedure, the Commission shall thereupon issue a notice setting a schedule for the filing of memoranda. The person electing the use of the shortened procedure, and any other interested entities, including the Commission staff, shall file, within 45 days of the notice, an initial memorandum that addresses the relevant facts and applicable law that support the position or positions taken regarding the matters at issue. Reply memoranda shall be filed within 20 days of the date by which the initial memoranda are due to be filed. Only participants who filed initial memoranda may file reply memoranda. Subpart T of part 385 of this chapter shall apply to all filings. Within 20 days after the last date that reply memoranda under the shortened procedure may be timely filed, the audited person who elected the shortened procedure may file a motion with the Commission requesting a trial-type hearing if new issues are raised by a party. To prevail in such a motion, the audited person must show that a party to the shortened procedure raised one or more new issues of material fact relevant to resolution of a matter in the shortened procedure such that fundamental fairness requires a trial-type hearing to resolve the new issue or issues so raised. Parties to the shortened procedure and the Commission staff may file responses to the motion. In ruling upon the motion, the Commission may determine that some or all of the issues be litigated in a trial-type hearing.
[Order 675, 71 FR 9706, Feb. 27, 2006]

Verification.
The facts stated in the memorandum must be sworn to by persons having knowledge thereof, which latter fact must affirmatively appear in the affidavit. Except under unusual circumstances, such persons should be those who would appear as witnesses if hearing were had to testify as to the facts stated in the memorandum.
§ 41.6
Determination.
If no formal hearing is had the matter in issue will be determined by the Commission on the basis of the facts and arguments submitted.
§ 41.7
Assignment for oral hearing.
Except when there are no material facts in dispute, when a person does not consent to the shortened procedure, the Commission will assign the proceeding for hearing as provided by subpart E of part 385 of this chapter. Notwithstanding a person's not giving consent to the shortened procedure, and instead seeking assignment for hearing as provided for by subpart E of part 385 of this chapter, the Commission will not assign the proceeding for a hearing when no material facts are in dispute. The Commission may also, in its discretion, at any stage in the proceeding, set the proceeding for hearing.

# Certification of Compliance With Accounting Regulations
§ 41.10
Examination of accounts.
(a) All Major and Nonmajor public utilities and licensees not classified as Class C or Class D prior to January 1, 1984 shall secure, for the year 1968 and each year thereafter until December 31, 1975, the services of an independent certified public accountant, or independent licensed public accountant, certified or licensed by a regulatory authority of a State or other political subdivision of the United States, to test compliance in all material respects of those schedules as are indicated in the General Instructions set out in the Annual Report, Form No. 1, with the Commission's applicable Uniform System of Accounts and published accounting releases. The Commission expects that identification of questionable matters by the independent accountant will facilitate their early resolution and that the independent accountant will seek advisory rulings by the Commission on such items. This examination shall be deemed supplementary to periodic Commission examinations of compliance.
(b) Beginning January 1, 1976, and each year thereafter, only independent certified public accountants, or independent licensed public accountants who were licensed on or before December 31, 1970, will be authorized to conduct annual audits and to certify to compliance in all material respects, of those schedules as are indicated in the General Instructions set out in the Annual Report, Form No. 1, with the Commission's applicable Uniform System of Accounts, published accounting releases and all other regulatory matters.

§ 41.11
Report of certification.
Each Major and Nonmajor (including those companies classified as nonoperating under Part 101, General Instruction 1(A)(3) of this chapter) public utility or licensee operating on a calendar year and not classified as Class C or Class D prior to January 1, 1984 must file with the Commission a letter or report of the independent accountant certifying approval, together with or within 30 days after the filing of the Annual Report, Form No. 1, covering the subjects and in the form prescribed in the General Instructions of the Annual Report. For such utility or licensee operating on a non-calendar fiscal year, the letter or report of the independent accountant certifying approval must be filed within 150 days of the close of the company's fiscal year; the letter or report must also identify which, if any, of the examined schedules do not conform to the Commission's requirements and shall describe the discrepancies that exist. The Commission will not be bound by a certification of compliance made by an independent accountant pursuant to this paragraph.
[73 FR 58736, Oct. 7, 2008]
§ 41.12
Qualifications of accountants.
The Commission will not recognize any certified public accountant or public accountant through December 31, 1975, who is not in fact independent. Beginning January 1, 1976, and each year thereafter, the Commission will recognize only independent certified public accountants, or independent licensed public accountants who were licensed on or before December 31, 1970, who are in fact independent. For example, an accountant will not be considered independent with respect to any person or any of its parents or subsidiaries in whom he has, or had during the period of report, any direct financial interest. The Commission will determine the fact of independence by considering all the relevant circumstances including evidence bearing on the relationships between the accountant and that person or any affiliate thereof.

# PART 42—LONG-TERM FIRM TRANSMISSION RIGHTS IN ORGANIZED ELECTRICITY MARKETS

# Authority:
16 U.S.C. 791a-825r and section 217 of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 824q.

# Source:
Order 681, 71 FR 43619, Aug. 1, 2006, unless otherwise noted.
§ 42.1
Requirement that Transmission Organizations with Organized Electricity Markets Offer Long-Term Firm Transmission Rights.
(a)
Purpose.
This section requires a transmission organization with one or more organized electricity markets (administered either by it or by another entity) to make available long-term firm transmission rights, pursuant to section 217(b)(4) of the Federal Power Act, that satisfy each of the guidelines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. This section does not require that a specific type of long-term firm transmission right be made available, and is intended to permit transmission organizations flexibility in satisfying the guidelines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Definitions.
As used in this section:
(1)
Transmission Organization
means a Regional Transmission Organization, Independent System Operator, independent transmission provider, or other independent transmission organization finally approved by the Commission for the operation of transmission facilities.
(2)
Load serving entity
means a distribution utility or an electric utility that has a service obligation.
(3)
Service obligation
means a requirement applicable to, or the exercise of authority granted to, an electric utility under Federal, State, or local law or under long-term contracts to provide electric service to end-users or to a distribution utility.
(4)
Organized Electricity Market
means an auction-based day ahead and real time wholesale market where a single entity receives offers to sell and bids to buy electric energy and/or ancillary services from multiple sellers and buyers and determines which sales and purchases are completed and at what prices, based on formal rules contained in Commission-approved tariffs, and where the prices are used by a transmission organization for establishing transmission usage charges.
(c)
General rule.
(1) Every public utility that is a transmission organization and that owns, operates or controls facilities used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and has one or more organized electricity markets (administered either by it or by another entity) must file with the Commission, no later than January 29, 2007, one of the following:
(i) Tariff sheets and rate schedules that make available long-term firm transmission rights that satisfy each of the guidelines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section; or
(ii) An explanation of how its current tariff and rate schedules already provide for long-term firm transmission rights that satisfy each of the guidelines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) Any transmission organization approved by the Commission for operation after January 29, 2007 that has one or more organized electricity markets (administered either by it or by another entity) will be required to satisfy this general rule.
(3) Filings made in compliance with this paragraph (c) must explain how the transmission organization's transmission planning and expansion procedures will accommodate long-term firm transmission rights, including but not limited to how the transmission organization will ensure that allocated long-term firm transmission rights remain feasible over their entire term.
(4) Each transmission organization subject to this general rule must also make its transmission planning and expansion procedures and plans publicly available, including (but not limited to) both the actual plans and any underlying information used to develop the plans.
(d)
Guidelines for Design and Administration of Long-term Firm Transmission Rights.
Transmission organizations subject to paragraph (c) of this section must make available long-term firm transmission rights that satisfy the following guidelines:
(1) The long-term firm transmission right should specify a source (injection node or nodes) and sink (withdrawal node or nodes), and a quantity (MW).
(2) The long-term firm transmission right must provide a hedge against day-ahead locational marginal pricing congestion charges or other direct assignment of congestion costs for the period covered and quantity specified.
Once allocated, the financial coverage provided by a financial long-term right should not be modified during its term (the “full funding” requirement) except in the case of extraordinary circumstances or through voluntary agreement of both the holder of the right and the transmission organization.
(3) Long-term firm transmission rights made feasible by transmission upgrades or expansions must be available upon request to any party that pays for such upgrades or expansions in accordance with the transmission organization's prevailing cost allocation methods for upgrades or expansions.
(4) Long-term firm transmission rights must be made available with term lengths (and/or rights to renewal) that are sufficient to meet the needs of load serving entities to hedge long-term power supply arrangements made or planned to satisfy a service obligation. The length of term of renewals may be different from the original term. Transmission organizations may propose rules specifying the length of terms and use of renewal rights to provide long-term coverage, but must be able to offer firm coverage for at least a 10 year period.
(5) Load serving entities must have priority over non-load serving entities in the allocation of long-term firm transmission rights that are supported by existing capacity. The transmission organization may propose reasonable limits on the amount of existing capacity used to support long-term firm transmission rights.
(6) A long-term transmission right held by a load serving entity to support a service obligation should be re-assignable to another entity that acquires that service obligation.
(7) The initial allocation of the long-term firm transmission rights shall not require recipients to participate in an auction.

Revision of the list.
Each public utility relying upon any estimates for its January 31st filing, shall revise the list compiled under paragraph (b) of this section no later than March 1 of the year in which the list was originally filed to reflect actual data not available to the utility prior to that time.

Stakeholder participation.
A Project Participation Plan is required to ensure stakeholders have access to accurate and timely information on the proposed project and permit application process.
(a)
Project Participation Plan.
An applicant must develop a Project Participation Plan and file it with the pre-filing materials under § 50.5(c)(7) that:
(1) Identifies specific tools and actions to facilitate stakeholder communications and public information, including an up-to-date project website with an interactive mapping component, and a readily accessible, single point of contact for the applicant;

Order 141, 12 FR 8503, Dec. 19, 1947, provides in part as follows:
Prescribing a system of accounts for public utilities and licensees under the Federal Power Act.
The Federal Power Commission acting pursuant to authority granted by the Federal Power Act, particularly sections 301(a), 304(a), and 309, and paragraph (13) of section 3, section 4(b) thereof, and finding such action necessary and appropriate for carrying out the provisions of said act, hereby adopts the accompanying system of accounts entitled “Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Public Utilities and Licensees Subject to the Provisions of the Federal Power Act,” and the rules and regulations contained therein; and
It is hereby ordered:
(a) That said system of accounts and said rules and regulations contained therein be and the same are hereby prescribed and promulgated as the system of accounts and rules and regulations of the Commission to be kept and observed by public utilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission and by licensees holding licenses issued by the Commission, to the extent and in the manner set forth therein;
(b) That said system of accounts and rules and regulations therein contained shall, as to all public utilities now subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission and as to all present licensees, become effective on January 1, 1937, and as to public utilities and licensees which may hereafter become subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, they shall become effective as of the date when such public utility becomes subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or on the effective date of the license;
(c) That a copy of said system of accounts and rules and regulation contained therein be forthwith served upon each public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and each licensee or permittee holding a license or permit from the Commission.
This system of accounts supersedes the system of accounts prescribed for licensees under the Federal Water Power Act; and Order No. 13, entered November 20, 1922, prescribing said system of accounts, was rescinded effective January 1, 1937.
Applicability of system of accounts.
This system of accounts is applicable in principle to all licensees subject to the Commission's accounting requirements under the Federal Power Act, and to all public utilities subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act. The Commission reserves the right, however, under the provisions of section 301(a) of the Federal Power Act to classify such licensees and public utilities and to prescribe a system of classification of accounts to be kept by and which will be convenient for and meet the requirements of each class.
This system of accounts is applicable to public utilities, as defined in this part, and to licensees engaged in the generation and sale of electric energy for ultimate distribution to the public.
This system of accounts shall also apply to agencies of the United States engaged in the generation and sale of electric energy for ultimate distribution to the public, so far as may be practicable, in accordance with applicable statutes.
In accordance with the requirements of section 3 of the Act (49 Stat. 839; 16 U.S.C. 796(13)), the “classification of investment in road and equipment of steam roads, issue of 1914, Interstate Commerce Commission”, is published and promulgated as a part of the accounting rules and regulations of the Commission, and a copy thereof appears as part 103 of this chapter. Irrespective of any rules and regulations contained in this system of accounts, the cost of original projects licensed under the Act, and also the cost of additions thereto and betterments thereof, shall be determined under the rules and principles as defined and interpreted in said classification of the Interstate Commerce Commission so far as applicable.

# General Instructions
1.
Classification of utilities.
A. For purpose of applying the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission, electric utilities and licensees are divided into classes, as follows:
(1)
Major.
Utilities and licensees that had, in each of the last three consecutive years, sales or transmission service that exceeded any one or more of the following:
(a) One million megawatt-hours of total sales;
(b) 100 megawatt-hours of sales for resale;
(c) 500 megawatt-hours of power exchanges delivered; or
(d) 500 megawatt-hours of wheeling for others (deliveries plus losses).
(2)
Nonmajor.
Utilities and licensees that are not classified as
Major
(as defined above), and had total sales in each of the last three consecutive years of 10,000 megawatt-hours or more.
(3)
Nonoperating.
Utilities and licensees formerly designated as Major or Nonmajor that have ceased operation but continue to collect amounts pursuant to a Commission-accepted tariff or rate schedule, or a Commission order.
B. This system applies to Major, Nonmajor, and Nonoperating utilities and licensees. Provisions have been incorporated into this system for those entities which, prior to January 1, 1984, were applying the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Public Utilities and Licensees subject to the Provisions of the Federal Power Act (Class C and Class D) [part 104 of this chapter, now revoked]. The notations (
Nonmajor
) and (
Major
) have been used to indicate those instructions and accounts from previous systems and classifications, which by definition, are not interchangeable without causing a loss of detail for the Major (previously Class A and Class B) or an increase in detail burden on the Nonmajor (previously Class C and Class D).
C. The class to which any utility or licensee belongs will originally be determined by its annual megawatt hours in each of the last three consecutive years, or in the case of a newly established entity, the projected data shall be the basis. Subsequent changes in classification shall be made as necessary when the megawatt-hours for each of the three immediately preceding years shall exceed the upper limit, or be less than the lower limit of the classification previously applicable to the utility.
D. Any utility may, at its option, adopt the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission for any larger class of utilities.
2.
Records.
A. Each utility shall keep its books of account, and all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in such books of account so
as to be able to furnish readily full information as to any item included in any account. Each entry shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant thereto.
B. The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records, such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.
C. No utility shall destroy any such books or records unless the destruction thereof is permitted by rules and regulations of the Commission.
D. In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary or experimental accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts, may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.
E. All amounts included in the accounts prescribed herein for electric plant and operating expenses shall be just and reasonable and any payments or accruals by the utility in excess of just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 426.5, Other Deductions.
F. The arrangement or sequence of the accounts prescribed herein shall not be controlling as to the arrangement or sequence in report forms which may be prescribed by the Commission.
3.
Numbering System.
A. The account numbering plan used herein consists of a system of three-digit whole numbers as follows:
100-199 Assets and other debits.
200-299 Liabilities and other credits.
300-399 Plant accounts.
400-432, 434-435 Income accounts.
433, 436-439 Retained earnings accounts.
440-459 Revenue accounts.
500-599 Production, transmission and distribution expenses.
900-949 Customer accounts, customer service and informational, sales, and general and administrative expenses.
B. In certain instances, numbers have been skipped in order to allow for possible later expansion or to permit better coordination with the numbering system for other utility departments.
C. The numbers prefixed to account titles are to be considered as parts of the titles. Each utility, however, may adopt for its own purposes a different system of account numbers (see also general instruction 2D) provided that the numbers herein prescribed shall appear in the descriptive headings of the ledger accounts and in the various sources of original entry; however, if a utility uses a different group of account numbers and it is not practicable to show the prescribed account numbers in the various sources of original entry, such reference to the prescribed account numbers may be omitted from the various sources of original entry. Moreover, each utility using different account numbers for its own purposes shall keep readily available a list of such account numbers which it uses and a reconciliation of such account numbers with the account numbers provided herein. It is intended that the utility's records shall be so kept as to permit ready analysis by prescribed accounts (by direct reference to sources of original entry to the extent practicable) and to permit preparation of financial and operating statements directly from such records at the end of each accounting period according to the prescribed accounts.
4.
Accounting Period.
Each utility shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that for each month all transactions applicable thereto, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the books of the utility. Amounts applicable or assignable to specific utility departments shall be so segregated monthly. Each utility shall close its books at the end of each calendar year unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.
5.
Submittal of Questions.
To maintain uniformity of accounting, utilities shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Commission for consideration and decision.
6.
Item Lists.
Lists of
items
appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the application of the prescribed accounting. The lists are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an item in a list warrants the inclusion of the item in
the account mentioned only when the text of the account also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one list. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts.
7.
Extraordinary Items.
It is the intent that net income shall reflect all items of profit and loss during the period with the exception of prior period adjustments as described in paragraph 7.1 and long-term debt as described in paragraph 17 below. Those items related to the effects of events and transactions which have occurred during the current period and which are of unusual nature and infrequent occurrence shall be considered extraordinary items. Accordingly, they will be events and transactions of significant effect which are abnormal and significantly different from the ordinary and typical activities of the company, and which would not reasonably be expected to recur in the forseeable future. (In determining significance, items should be considered individually and not in the aggregate. However, the effects of a series of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable event or plan of action should be considered in the aggregate. To be considered as extraordinary under the above guidelines, an item should be more than approximately 5 percent of income, computed before extraordinary items. Commission approval must be obtained to treat an item of less than 5 percent, as extraordinary. (See accounts 434 and 435.)
7.1
Prior period items.
A. Items of profit and loss related to the following shall be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current year:
(1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior year.
(2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of pre-acquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries.
B. All other items of profit and loss recognized during the year shall be included in the determination of net income for that year.
8.
Unaudited Items (Major Utility).
Whenever a financial statement is required by the Commission, if it is known that a transaction has occurred which affects the accounts but the amount involved in the transaction and its effect upon the accounts cannot be determined with absolute accuracy, the amount shall be estimated and such estimated amount included in the proper accounts. The utility is not required to anticipate minor items which would not appreciably affect the accounts.
9.
Distribution of Pay and Expenses of Employees.
The charges to electric plant, operating expense and other accounts for services and expenses of employees engaged in activities chargeable to various accounts, such as construction, maintenance, and operations, shall be based upon the actual time engaged in the respective classes of work, or in case that method is impracticable, upon the basis of a study of the time actually engaged during a representative period.
10.
Payroll Distribution.
Underlying accounting data shall be maintained so that the distribution of the cost of labor charged direct to the various accounts will be readily available. Such underlying data shall permit a reasonably accurate distribution to be made of the cost of labor charged initially to clearing accounts so that the total labor cost may be classified among construction, cost of removal, electric operating functions (steam generation, nuclear generation, hydraulic generation, transmission, distribution, etc.) and nonutility operations.
11.
Accounting to be on Accrual Basis.
A. The utility is required to keep its accounts on the accrual basis. This requires the inclusion in its accounts of all known transactions of appreciable amount which affect the accounts. If bills covering such transactions have not been received or rendered, the amounts shall be estimated and appropriate adjustments made when the bills are received.
B. When payments are made in advance for items such as insurance, rents, taxes or interest the amount applicable to future periods shall be charged to account 165, Prepayments,
and spread over the periods to which applicable by credits to account 165, and charges to the accounts appropriate for the expenditure.
12.
Records for Each Plant (Major Utility).
Separate records shall be maintained by electric plant accounts of the book cost of each plant owned, including additions by the utility to plant leased from others, and of the cost of operating and maintaining each plant owned or operated. The term
plant
as here used means each generating station and each transmission line or appropriate group of transmission lines.
13.
Accounting for Other Departments.
If the utility also operates other utility departments, such as gas, water, etc., it shall keep such accounts for the other departments as may be prescribed by proper authority and in the absence of prescribed accounts, it shall keep such accounts as are proper or necessary to reflect the results of operating each such department. It is not intended that proprietary and similar accounts which apply to the utility as a whole shall be departmentalized.
14.
Transactions With Associated Companies (Major Utility).
Each utility shall keep its accounts and records so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously statements of all transactions with associated companies. The statements may be required to show the general nature of the transactions, the amounts involved therein and the amounts included in each account prescribed herein with respect to such transactions. Transactions with associated companies shall be recorded in the appropriate accounts for transactions of the same nature. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed as restraining the utility from subdividing accounts for the purpose of recording separately transactions with associated companies.
15.
Contingent Assets and Liabilities (Major Utility).
Contingent assets represent a possible source of value to the utility contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions regarded as uncertain. Contingent liabilities include items which may under certain conditions become obligations of the utility but which are neither direct nor assumed liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. The utility shall be prepared to give a complete statement of significant contingent assets and liabilities (including cumulative dividends on preference stock) in its annual report and at such other times as may be requested by the Commission.
16.
Separate Accounts or Records for Each Licensed Project.
The accounts or records of each licensee shall be so kept as to show for each project (including pumped storage) under license;
(a) The actual legitimate original cost of the project, including the original cost (or fair value, as determined under section 23 of the Federal Power Act) of the original project, the original cost of additions thereto and betterments thereof and credits for property retired from service, as determined under the Commission's regulations;
(b) The charges for operation and maintenance of the project property directly assignable to the project;
(c) The credits and debits to the depreciation and amortization accounts, and the balances in such accounts;
(d) The credits and debits to operating revenue, income, and retained earnings accounts that can be identified with and directly assigned to the project.

# Note:
The purpose of this instruction is to insure that accounts or records are currently maintained by each licensee from which reports may be made to the Commission for use in determining the net investment in each licensed project. The instruction covers only the debit and credit items appearing in the licensee's accounts which may be identified with and assigned directly to any licensed project. In the determination of the net investment as defined in section 3 of the Federal Power Act, allocations of items affecting the net investment may be required where direct assignment is not practicable.
17.
Long-Term Debt: Premium, Discount and Expense, and Gain or Loss on Reacquisition.
A.
Premium, discount and expense.
A separate premium, discount and expense account shall be maintained for each class and series of long-term debt (including receivers' certificates) is- sued or assumed by the utility. The premium will be recorded in account
225, Unamortized Premium on Long-Term Debt, the discount will be recorded in account 226, Unamortized Discount on Long-Term Debt—Debit, and the expense of issuance shall be recorded in account 181, Unamortized Debt Expense.
The premium, discount and expense shall be amortized over the life of the respective issues under a plan which will distribute the amounts equitably over the life of the securities. The amortization shall be on a monthly basis, and amounts thereof relating to discount and expense shall be charged to account 428, Amortization of Debt Discount and Expense. The amounts relating to premium shall be credited to account 429, Amortization of Premium on Debt—Credit.
B.
Reacquisition, without refunding.
When long-term debt is reacquired or redeemed without being converted into another form of long-term debt and when the transaction is not in connection with a refunding operation (primarily redemptions for sinking fund purposes), the difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition and the face value; plus any un- amortized premium less any related unamortized debt expense and reacquisition costs; or less any unamortized discount, related debt expense and reacquisition costs applicable to the debt redeemed, retired and canceled, shall be included in account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The utility shall amortize the recorded amounts equally on a monthly basis over the remaining life of the respective security issues (old original debt). The amounts so amortized shall be charged to account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.
C.
Reacquisition, with refunding.
When the redemption of one issue or series of bonds or other long-term obligations is financed by another issue or series before the maturity date of the first issue, the difference between the amount paid upon refunding and the face value; plus any unamortized premium less related debt expense or less any unamortized discount and related debt expense, applicable to the debt refunded, shall be included in account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The utility may elect to account for such amounts as follows:
(1) Write them off immediately when the amounts are insignificant.
(2) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired, or
(3) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the life of the new issue.
Once an election is made, it shall be applied on a consistent basis. The amounts in (1), (2) or (3) above shall be charged to account 428.1. Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.
D. Under methods (2) and (3) above, the increase or reduction in current income taxes resulting from the reacquisition should be apportioned over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired or over the life of the new issue, as appropriate, as directed more specifically in paragraphs E and F below.
E. When the utility recognizes the loss in the year of reacquisition as a tax deduction, account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited and account 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, shall be credited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of account 283.
F. When the utility chooses to recognize the gain in the year of reacquisition as a taxable gain, account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited and account 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes, shall be debited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of account 190.
G. When the utility chooses to use the optional privilege of deferring the tax on the gain attributable to the reacquisition of debt by reducing the depreciable basis of utility property for tax purposes, pursuant to section 108 of
the Internal Revenue Code, the related tax effects shall be deferred as the income is recognized for accounting purposes, and the deferred amounts shall be amortized over the life of the associated property on a vintage year basis. Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited, and account 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effect applicable to the portion of the income, attributable to reacquired debt, recognized for accounting purposes during the period. Account 282 shall be debited and account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effects, during the life of the property, attributable to the reduction in the depreciable basis for tax purposes.
H. The tax effects relating to gain or loss shall be allocated as above to utility operations except in cases where a portion of the debt reacquired is directly applicable to nonutility operations. In that event, the related portion of the tax effects shall be allocated to nonutility operations. Where it can be established that reacquired debt is generally applicable to both utility and nonutility operations, the tax effects shall be allocated between utility and nonutility operations based on the ratio of net investment in utility plant to net investment in nonutility plant.
I. Premium, discount, or expense on debt shall not be included as an element in the cost of construction or acquisition of property (tangible or intangible), except under the provisions of account 432, Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction—Credit.
J.
Alternate method.
Where a regulatory authority or a group of regulatory authorities having prime rate jurisdiction over the utility specifically disallows the rate principle of amortizing gains or losses on reacquisition of long-term debt without refunding, and does not apply the gain or loss to reduce interest charges in computing the allowed rate of return for rate purposes, then the following alternate method may be used to account for gains or losses relating to reacquisition of long-term debt, with or without refunding.
(1) The difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition of any long-term debt and the face value, adjusted for unamortized discount, expenses or premium, as the case may be, applicable to the debt redeemed shall be recognized currently in income and recorded in account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or account 426.5, Other Deductions.
(2) When this alternate method of accounting is used, the utility shall include a footnote to each financial statement, prepared for public use, explaining why this method is being used along with the treatment given for ratemaking purposes.
18.
Comprehensive Interperiod In- come Tax Allocation.
A. Where there are timing differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income, the income tax effects of such transactions are to be recognized in the periods in which the differences between book accounting income and taxable income arise and in the periods in which the differences reverse using the deferred tax method. In general, comprehensive interperiod tax allocation should be followed whenever transactions enter into the determination of pretax accounting income for the period even though some transactions may affect the determination of taxes payable in a different period, as further qualified below.
B. Utilities are not required to utilize comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation until the deferred income taxes are included as an expense in the rate level by the regulatory authority having rate jurisdiction over the utility. Where comprehensive interperiod tax allocation accounting is not practiced the utility shall include as a note to each financial statement, prepared for public use, a footnote explanation setting forth the utility's accounting policies with respect to interperiod tax allocation and describing the treatment for ratemaking purposes of the
tax timing differences by regulatory authorities having rate jurisdiction.
C. Should the utility be subject to more than one agency having rate jurisdiction, its accounts shall appropriately reflect the ratemaking treatment (deferral or flow through) of each jurisdiction.
D. Once comprehensive interperiod tax allocation has been initiated either in whole or in part it shall be practiced on a consistent basis and shall not be changed or discontinued without prior Commission approval.
E. Tax effects deferred currently will be recorded as deferred debits or deferred credits in accounts 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes, 281, Accumulated Deferred Income Tax- es—Accelerated Amortization Property, 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, and 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, as appropriate. The resulting amounts recorded in these accounts shall be disposed of as prescribed in this system of accounts or as otherwise authorized by the Commission.
19.
Criteria for classifying leases.
A. If at its inception a lease meets one or more of the following criteria, the lease shall be classified as a capital lease. Otherwise, it shall be classified as an operating lease.
(1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term
(2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.
(3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.
(4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease. The lessee utility shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate, unless (A) it is practicable for the utility to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and (B) the implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit rate.
B. If at any time the lessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by renewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted in a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph A had the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised agreement shall be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the criteria in paragraph A shall be applied for purposes of classifying the new lease. Likewise, any action that extends the lease beyond the expiration of the existing lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than those already included in the lease term, shall be considered as a new agreement and shall be classified according to the above provisions. Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee) shall not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.
20.
Accounting for leases.
A. All leases shall be classified as either capital or operating leases. The accounting for capitalized leases is effective January 1, 1984, except for the retroactive classification of certain leases which, in accordance with FASB No. 71, will not be required to be capitalized until after a three year transition period. For the purpose of reporting to the FERC, the transition period
shall be deemed to end December 31, 1986.
B. The utility shall record a capital lease as an asset in account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases, Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel under Capital Leases, or account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate, and an obligation in account 227, Obligations under Capital Leases—Noncurrent, or account 243, Obligations under Capital Leases—Current, at an amount equal to the present value at the beginning of the lease term of minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, together with any profit thereon. However, if the amount so determined exceeds the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease, the amount recorded as the asset and obligation shall be the fair value.
C. The utility, as a lessee, shall recognize an asset retirement obligation (
See
General Instruction 25) arising from the plant under a capital lease unless the obligation is recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease. The utility shall record the asset retirement cost by debiting account 101.1, Property under capital leases, or account 120.6, Nuclear fuel under capital leases, or account 121, Nonutility property, as appropriate, and crediting the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations. Asset retirement costs recorded in account 101.1, account 120.6, or account 121 shall be amortized by charging rent expense (
See
Operating Expense Instruction 3), or account 518, Nuclear fuel expense (Major only), or account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, as appropriate, and crediting a separate subaccount of the account in which the asset retirement costs are recorded. Charges for the periodic accretion of the liability in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, shall be recorded by a charge to account 411.10, Accretion expense, for electric utility plant, and account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, for nonutility plant and a credit to account 230, Asset retirement obligations.
D. Rental payments on all leases shall be charged to rent expense, fuel expense, construction work in progress, or other appropriate accounts as they become payable.
E. For a capital lease, for each period during the lease term, the amounts recorded for the asset and obligation shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion of each lease payment that would have been allocated to the reduction of the obligation, if the payment had been treated as a payment on an installment obligation (liability) and allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the obligation so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance.
21.
Allowances and environmental credits.
A. Public utilities owning allowances and environmental credits for operational purposes, shall account for such allowances and environmental credits at historical cost in account 158.1, Allowance Inventory, account 158.2, Allowances Withheld, account 158.3, Bundled Environmental Credits Inventory, or account 158.4, Unbundled Environmental Credits Inventory, as appropriate.
B. Allowances and environmental credits acquired for speculative purposes shall be accounted for in account 124, Other Investments. When purchased allowances and environmental credits acquired for speculative purposes become eligible for use in different years, and the allocation of the purchase cost cannot be determined by fair value, the purchase cost allocated to allowances and environmental credits of each vintage shall be determined through use of a present-value based measurement. The interest rate used in the present-value measurement shall be the utility's incremental borrowing rate, in the month in which the allowances and environmental credits are acquired, for a loan with a term similar to the period that it will hold the allowances and environmental credits and in an amount equal to the purchase price.
C. The underlying records supporting operational allowances and environmental credits recorded in account 158.1, account 158.2, account 158.3, and account 158.4 shall be maintained in
sufficient detail at historical costs and provide the number of allowances and environmental credits and the related cost by vintage year, including allowances and environmental credits acquired at zero cost.
D. Issuances from inventory included in account 158.1, account 158.2, account 158.3, and account 158.4 shall be accounted for on a vintage basis using a monthly weighted-average method of historical cost determination. The cost of eligible allowances and environmental credits not used in the current year, shall be transferred to the vintage for the immediately following year.
E. Account 158.1 shall be credited and account 509, Allowances, debited concurrent with the monthly remittance of the allowances to be charged to expense based on each month's emissions. Account 158.3 and account 158.4 shall be credited and account 555.2, Bundled Environmental Credits, and account 555.3, Unbundled Environmental Credits, debited, respectively, so that the cost of the environmental credits to be remitted for the year is charged to expense based on each month's usage. This may, in certain circumstances, require allocation of the cost between months on a fractional basis.
F. In any period in which actual emissions exceed the amount allowable based on eligible allowances owned, the utility shall estimate the cost to acquire the additional allowances needed and charge account 158.1 with the estimated cost and credit the proper liability account. In any period in which a utility records its estimated amount of required environmental credits, the utility shall debit account 158.3 or account 158.4 with the estimated cost and credit the proper liability account. When differences between the estimated and actual costs become known, the adjustments should be made through account 158.1, account 158.3, and account 158.4, as well as account 509, account 555.2, and account 555.3 within a single month, as appropriate.
G. When a prepayment is made for allowances or environmental credits, the payment is debited to account 165, Prepayments. This accounting is not intended to influence the outcome of any rate treatment.
H. Penalties assessed by any authoritative agencies shall be charged to account 426.3, Penalties.
I. Gains on dispositions of allowances and environmental credits, other than those held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. First, if there is uncertainty as to the regulatory treatment, the gain shall be deferred in account 254, Other Regulatory Liabilities, pending resolution of the uncertainty. Second, if there is certainty as to the existence of a regulatory liability, the gain will be credited to account 254, with subsequent recognition in income when reductions in charges to customers occur or the liability is otherwise satisfied. Third, all other gains will be credited to account 411.8, Gains from Disposition of Allowances, or account 411.11, Gains from Disposition of Environmental Credits. Losses on disposition of allowances and environmental credits, other than those held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. Losses that qualify as regulatory assets shall be charged directly to account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets. All other losses shall be charged to account 411.9, Losses from Disposition of Allowances, or account 411.12, Losses from Disposition of Environmental Credits. (
See
Definition No. 31.) Gains or losses on disposition of allowances and environmental credits held for speculative purposes shall be recognized in account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate.
J. Revenues for environmental credits associated with the sale of energy shall be recorded in the appropriate operating revenue account.
22.
Depreciation Accounting.
A.
Method.
Utilities must use a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property over the service life of the property.
B.
Service lives.
Estimated useful service lives of depreciable property must be supported by engineering, economic, or other depreciation studies.
C.
Rate.
Utilities must use percentage rates of depreciation that are based on a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner
the service value of depreciable property to the service life of the property. Where composite depreciation rates are used, they should be based on the weighted average estimated useful service lives of the depreciable property comprising the composite group.
23.
Accounting for other comprehensive income.
A. Utilities shall record items of other comprehensive income in account 219, Accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts included in this account shall be maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include, foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for account 219 so that the company can readily identify the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account.
B. When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in account 219 to avoid double counting of that amount.
C. When it is probable that an item of other comprehensive income will be included in the development of cost-of-service rates in subsequent periods, that amount of unrealized losses or gains will be recorded in Accounts 182.3 or 254 as appropriate.
24.
Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
A. Utilities shall recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value, except those falling within recognized exceptions. Normal purchases or sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of goods that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all of the following characteristics:
(1) It has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.
(2) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors.
(3) Its terms require or permit net settlement, can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract, or provides for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.
B. The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon its intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges shall be recorded in account 175, derivative instrument assets, or account 244, derivative instrument liabilities, as appropriate, with the gains recorded in account 421, miscellaneous nonoperating income, and losses recorded in account 426.5, other deductions.
C. A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge. A hedge is used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. A company shall maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined.
D. If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it shall record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument to account 176, derivative instrument assets-hedges, or account 245, derivative instrument liabilities-hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the subaccount of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be
used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. In the case of a fair value hedge of a firm commitment a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged.
E. If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it shall record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in account 176, derivative instrument assets-hedges, or account 245, derivative instrument liabilities-hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in account 219, accumulated other comprehensive income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item enters into the determination of net income.
25.
Accounting for asset retirement obligations.
A. An
asset retirement obligation
represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that a company is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An
asset retirement cost
represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated asset retirement cost shall be stated at the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred.
B. The utility shall initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and charge the associated asset retirement costs to electric utility plant (including accounts 101.1 and 120.6), and nonutility plant, as appropriate, related to the plant that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost shall be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligations. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a utility shall recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement changes to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, as follows:
(1) The utility shall record the accretion of the liability by debiting account 411.10, Accretion expense, for electric utility plant, account 413, Expenses of electric plant leased to others, for electric plant leased to others, and account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, for nonutility plant and crediting account 230, Asset retirement obligations; and
(2) The utility shall recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in account 230 with the corresponding adjustment to electric utility plant, electric plant leased to others, and nonutility plant, as appropriate. The utility shall on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations.
C. Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with utility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation included in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and the actual amount paid to settle the obligation shall be accounted for as follows:
(1) Gains shall be credited to account 411.6, Gains from disposition of utility plant, and;
(2) Losses shall be charged to account 411.7, Losses from disposition of utility plant.
D. Gains or losses on the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with nonutility plant resulting
from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and the amount paid to settle the obligation, shall be accounted for as follows:
(1) Gains shall be credited to account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, and;
(2) Losses shall be charged to account 426.5, Other deductions.
E. Separate subsidiary records shall be maintained for each asset retirement obligation showing the initial liability and associated asset retirement cost, any incremental amounts of the liability incurred in subsequent reporting periods for additional layers of the original liability and related asset retirement cost, the accretion of the liability, the subsequent measurement changes to the asset retirement obligation, the depreciation and amortization of the asset retirement costs and related accumulated depreciation, and the settlement date and actual amount paid to settle the obligation. For purposes of analyses a utility shall maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation.

# Electric Plant Instructions
1.
Classification of electric plant at effective date of system of accounts (Major utilities).
A. The electric plant accounts provided herein are the same as those contained in the prior system of accounts except for inclusion of accounts for nuclear production plant and some changes in classification in the general equipment accounts. Except for these changes, the balances in the various plant accounts, as determined under the prior system of accounts, should be carried forward. Any remaining balance of plant which has not yet been classified, pursuant to the requirements of the prior system, shall be classified in accordance with the following instructions.
B. The cost to the utility of its unclassified plant shall be ascertained by analysis of the utility's records. Adjustments shall not be made to record in utility plant accounts amounts previously charged to operating expenses or to income deductions in accordance with the uniform system of accounts in effect at the time or in accordance with the discretion of management as exercised under a uniform system of accounts, or under accounting practices previously followed.
C. The detailed electric plant accounts (301 to 399, inclusive) shall be stated on the basis of cost to the utility of plant constructed by it and the original cost, estimated if not known, of plant acquired as an operating unit or system. The difference between the original cost, as above, and the cost to the utility of electric plant after giving effect to any accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization shall be recorded in account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The original cost of electric plant shall be determined by analysis of the utility's records or those of the predecessor or vendor companies with respect to electric plant previously acquired as operating units or systems and the difference between the original cost so determined, less accumulated provisions for depreciation and amortization and the cost to the utility with necessary adjustments for retirements from the date of acquisition, shall be entered in account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. Any difference between the cost of electric plant and its book cost, when not properly includible in other accounts, shall be recorded in account 116, Other Electric Plant Adjustments.
D. Plant acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instruction 19.
Criteria for Classifying Leases,
shall be recorded in Account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel under Capital Leases, as appropriate.
2.
Electric Plant To Be Recorded at Cost.
A. All amounts included in the accounts for electric plant acquired as an
operating unit or system, except as otherwise provided in the texts of the intangible plant accounts, shall be stated at the cost incurred by the person who first devoted the property to utility service. All other electric plant shall be included in the accounts at the cost incurred by the utility, except for property acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instruction 19.
Criteria for Classifying Leases,
and is recorded in Account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel under Capital Leases. Where the term
cost
is used in the detailed plant accounts, it shall have the meaning stated in this paragraph.
B. When the consideration given for property is other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined on a cash basis (see, however, definition 9). In the entry recording such transition, the actual consideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be prepared to furnish the Commission the particulars of its determination of the cash value of the consideration if other than cash.
C. When property is purchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge shall be made to the electric plant accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures occasioned solely by such form of payment.
D. The electric plant accounts shall not include the cost or other value of electric plant contributed to the company. Contributions in the form of money or its equivalent toward the construction of electric plant shall be credited to accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Plant constructed from contributions of cash or its equivalent shall be shown as a reduction to gross plant constructed when assembling cost data in work orders for posting to plant ledgers of accounts. The accumulated gross costs of plant accumulated in the work order shall be recorded as a debit in the plant ledger of accounts along with the related amount of contributions concurrently be recorded as a credit.
3.
Components of construction cost.
A. For Major utilities, the cost of construction properly includible in the electric plant accounts shall include, where applicable, the direct and overhead cost as listed and defined hereunder:
(1)
Contract work
includes amounts paid for work performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, costs incident to the award of such contracts, and the inspection of such work.
(2)
Labor
includes the pay and expenses of employees of the utility engaged on construction work, and related workmen's compensation insurance, payroll taxes and similar items of expense. It does not include the pay and expenses of employees which are distributed to construction through clearing accounts nor the pay and expenses included in other items hereunder.
(3)
Materials and supplies
includes the purchase price at the point of free delivery plus customs duties, excise taxes, the cost of inspection, loading and transportation, the related stores expenses, and the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop. In determining the cost of materials and supplies used for construction, proper allowance shall be made for unused materials and supplies, for materials recovered from temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of materials and supplies.

# Note:
The cost of individual items of equipment of small value (for example, $500 or less) or of short life, including small portable tools and implements, shall not be charged to utility plant accounts unless the correctness of the accounting therefor is verified by current inventories. The cost shall be charged to the appropriate operating expense or clearing accounts, according to the use of such items, or, if such items are consumed directly in construction work, the cost shall be included as part of the cost of the construction
(4)
Transportation
includes the cost of transporting employees, materials and supplies, tools, purchased equipment, and other work equipment (when not under own power) to and from points of construction. It includes amounts paid to others as well as the cost of operating the utility's own transportation equipment. (See item 5 following.)
(5)
Special machine service
includes the cost of labor (optional), materials and
supplies, depreciation, and other expenses incurred in the maintenance, operation and use of special machines, such as steam shovels, pile drivers, derricks, ditchers, scrapers, material unloaders, and other labor saving machines; also expenditures for rental, maintenance and operation of machines of others. It does not include the cost of small tools and other individual items of small value or short life which are included in the cost of materials and supplies. (See item 3, above.) When a particular construction job requires the use for an extended period of time of special machines, transportation or other equipment, the net book cost thereof, less the appraised or salvage value at time of release from the job, shall be included in the cost of construction.
(6)
Shop service
includes the proportion of the expense of the utility's shop department assignable to construction work except that the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop shall be included in
materials and supplies.
(7)

The cost rates for long-term debt and preferred stock shall be the weighted average cost determined in the manner indicated in § 35.13 of the Commission's Regulations Under the Federal Power Act. The cost rate for common equity shall be the rate granted common equity in the last rate proceeding before the ratemaking body having primary rate jurisdictions. If such cost rate is not available, the average rate actually earned during the preceding three years shall be used. The short-term debt balances and related cost and the average balance for construction work in progress plus nuclear fuel in process of refinement, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication shall be estimated for the current year with appropriate adjustments as actual data becomes available.

# Note:
When a part only of a plant or project is placed in operation or is completed and ready for service but the construction work as a whole is incomplete, that part of the cost of the property placed in operation or ready for service, shall be treated as
Electric Plant in Service
and allowance for funds used during construction thereon as a charge to construction shall cease. Allowance for funds used during construction on that part of the cost of the plant which is incomplete may be continued as a charge to construction until such time as it is placed in operation or is ready for service, except as limited in item 17, above.
(18)
Earnings and expenses during construction.
The earnings and expenses during construction shall constitute a component of construction costs.
(a) The earnings shall include revenues received or earned for power produced by generating plants during the construction period and sold or used by the utility. Where such power is sold to an independent purchaser before intermingling with power generated by other plants, the credit shall consist of the selling price of the energy. Where the power generated by a plant under construction is delivered to the utility's electric system for distribution and sale, or is delivered to an associated company, or is delivered to and used by the utility for purposes other than distribution and sale (for manufacturing or industrial use, for example), the credit shall be the fair value of the energy so delivered. The revenues shall also include rentals for lands, buildings etc., and miscellaneous receipts not properly includible in other accounts.
(b) The expenses shall consist of the cost of operating the power plant, and other costs incident to the production and delivery of the power for which construction is credited under paragraph (a), above, including the cost of repairs and other expenses of operating and maintaining lands, buildings, and other property, and other miscellaneous and like expenses not properly includible in other accounts.
(19)
Training costs
(Major and Nonmajor Utilities). When it is necessary that employees be trained to operate or maintain plant facilities that are being constructed and such facilities are not conventional in nature, or are new to the company's operations, these costs may be capitalized as a component of construction cost. Once plant is placed in service, the capitalization of training costs shall cease and subsequent training costs shall be expensed. (See Operating Expense Instruction 4.)
(20)
Studies
includes the costs of studies such as nuclear operational, safety, or seismic studies or environmental studies mandated by regulatory bodies relative to plant under construction. Studies relative to facilities in service shall be charged to account 183, Preliminary Survey and Investigation Charges.

The costs recognized as a result of asset retirement obligations incurred during the construction and testing of utility plant shall constitute a component of construction costs.
B. For Nonmajor utilities, the cost of construction of property chargeable to the electric plant accounts shall include, where applicable, the cost of labor; materials and supplies; transportation; work done by others for the utility; injuries and damages incurred in construction work; privileges and permits; special machine service; allowance for funds used during construction, not to exceed without prior approval of the Commission, amounts computed in accordance with the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) of paragraph (17) of this Instruction; training costs; and such portion of general engineering, administrative salaries and expenses, insurance, taxes, and other analogous items as may be properly includable in construction costs. (See Operating Expense Instruction 4.) The rates and balances of short and long-term debt, preferred stock, common equity and construction work in progress shall be determined as prescribed in paragraph (b) of paragraph (17) of this Instruction.
4.
Overhead Construction Costs.
A. All overhead construction costs, such as engineering, supervision, general office salaries and expenses, construction engineering and supervision by others than the accounting utility, law expenses, insurance, injuries and damages, relief and pensions, taxes and interest, shall be charged to particular jobs or units on the basis of the amounts of such overheads reasonably applicable thereto, to the end that each job or unit shall bear its equitable proportion of such costs and that the entire cost of the unit, both direct and overhead, shall be deducted from the plant accounts at the time the property is retired.
B. As far as practicable, the determination of pay roll charges includible in construction overheads shall be based on time card distributions thereof. Where this procedure is impractical, special studies shall be made periodically of the time of supervisory employees devoted to construction activities to the end that only such overhead costs as have a definite relation to construction shall be capitalized. The addition to direct construction costs of arbitrary percentages or amounts to cover assumed overhead costs is not permitted.
C. For Major utilities, the records supporting the entries for overhead construction costs shall be so kept as to show the total amount of each overhead for each year, the nature and amount of each overhead expenditure charged to each construction work order and to each electric plant account, and the bases of distribution of such costs.
5.
Electric Plant Purchased or Sold.
A. When electric plant constituting an operating unit or system is acquired by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, after the effective date of this system of accounts, the costs of acquisition, including expenses incidental thereto properly includible in electric plant, shall be charged to account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold.
B. The accounting for the acquisition shall then be completed as follows:
(1) The original cost of plant, estimated if not known, shall be credited to account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently charged to the appropriate electric
plant in service accounts and to account 104, Electric Plant Leased to Others, account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, and account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Electric, as appropriate.
(2) The depreciation and amortization applicable to the original cost of the properties purchased shall be charged to account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently credited to the appropriate account for accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization.
(3) The cost to the utility of any property includible in account 121, Nonutility Property, shall be transferred thereto.
(4) The amount remaining in account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, shall then be closed to account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments.
C. If property acquired in the purchase of an operating unit or system is in such physical condition when acquired that it is necessary substantially to rehabilitate it in order to bring the property up to the standards of the utility, the cost of such work, except replacements, shall be accounted for as a part of the purchase price of the property.
D. When any property acquired as an operating unit or system includes duplicate or other plant which will be retired by the accounting utility in the reconstruction of the acquired property or its consolidation with previously owned property, the proposed accounting for such property shall be presented to the Commission.
E. In connection with the acquisition of electric plant constituting an operating unit or system, the utility shall procure, if possible, all existing records relating to the property acquired, or certified copies thereof, and shall preserve such records in conformity with regulations or practices governing the preservation of records of its own construction.
F. When electric plant constituting an operating unit or system is sold, conveyed, or transferred to another by sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, the book cost of the property sold or transferred to another shall be credited to the appropriate utility plant accounts, including amounts carried in account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The amounts (estimated if not known) carried with respect thereto in the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization and in account 252, Customer Advances for Construction, shall be charged to such accounts and contra entries made to account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the difference, if any, between (1) the net amount of debits and credits and (2) the consideration received for the property (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be included in account 421.1. Gain on Disposition of Property, or account 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property. (See account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold.)

# Note:
In cases where existing utilities merge or consolidate because of financial or operating reasons or statutory requirements rather than as a means of transferring title of purchased properties to a new owner, the accounts of the constituent utilities, with the approval of the Commission, may be combined. In the event original cost has not been determined, the resulting utility shall proceed to determine such cost as outlined herein.
6.
Expenditures on Leased Property.
A. The cost of substantial initial improvements (including repairs, rear-rangements, additions, and betterments) made in the course of preparing for utility service property leased for a period of more than one year, and the cost of subsequent substantial additions, replacements, or betterments to such property, shall be charged to the electric plant account appropriate for the class of property leased. If the service life of the improvements is terminable by action of the lease, the cost, less net salvage, of the improvements shall be spread over the life of the lease by charges to account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant. However, if the service life is not terminated by action of the lease but by depreciation proper, the cost of the improvements, less net salvage, shall be accounted for as depreciable plant. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to property leased under
either capital leases or operating leases.
B. If improvements made to property leased for a period of more than one year are of relatively minor cost, or if the lease is for a period of not more than one year, the cost of the improvements shall be charged to the account in which the rent is included, either directly or by amortization thereof.
7.
Land and Land Rights.
A. The accounts for land and land rights shall include the cost of land owned in fee by the utility and rights. Interests, and privileges held by the utility in land owned by others, such as leaseholds, easements, water and water power rights, diversion rights, submersion rights, rights-of-way, and other like interests in land. Do not include in the accounts for land and land rights and rights-of-way costs incurred in connection with first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with the construction and installation of plant. Such costs shall be included in the appropriate plant accounts directly benefited.
B. Where special assessments for public improvements provide for deferred payments, the full amount of the assessments shall be charged to the appropriate land account and the unpaid balance shall be carried in an appropriate liability account. Interest on unpaid balances shall be charged to the appropriate interest account. If any part of the cost of public improvements is included in the general tax levy, the amount thereof shall be charged to the appropriate tax account.
C. The net profit from the sale of timber, cord wood, sand, gravel, other resources or other property acquired with the rights-of-way or other lands shall be credited to the appropriate plant account to which related. Where land is held for a considerable period of time and timber and other natural resources on the land at the time of purchase increases in value, the net profit (after giving effect to the cost of the natural resources) from the sales of timber or its products or other natural resources shall be credited to the appropriate utility operating income account when such land has been recorded in account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use or classified as plant in service, otherwise to account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income.
D. Separate entries shall be made for the acquisition, transfer, or retirement of each parcel of land, and each land right (except rights of way for distribution lines), or water right, having a life of more than one year. A record shall be maintained showing the nature of ownership, full legal description, area, map reference, purpose for which used, city, county, and tax district on which situated, from whom purchased or to whom sold, payment given or received, other costs, contract date and number, date of recording of deed, and book and page of record. Entries transferring or retiring land or land rights shall refer to the original entry recording its acquisition.
E. Any difference between the amount received from the sale of land or land rights, less agents' commissions and other costs incident to the sale, and the book cost of such land or rights, shall be included in account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant when such property has been recorded in account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, otherwise to account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate, unless a reserve therefor has been authorized and provided. Appropriate adjustments of the accounts shall be made with respect to any structures or improvements located on land sold.
F. The cost of buildings and other improvements (other than public improvements) shall not be included in the land accounts. If at the time of acquisition of an interest in land such interest extends to buildings or other improvements (other than public improvements) which are then devoted to utility operations, the land and improvements shall be separately appraised and the cost allocated to land and buildings or improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are removed or wrecked without being used in operations, the cost of removing or wrecking shall be charged and the salvage credited to the account
in which the cost of the land is recorded.
G. When the purchase of land for electric operations requires the purchase of more land than needed for such purposes, the charge to the specific land account shall be based upon the cost of the land purchased, less the fair market value of that portion of the land which is not to be used in utility operations. The portion of the cost measured by the fair market value of the land not to be used shall be included in account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, or account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate.
H. Provisions shall be made for amortizing amounts carried in the accounts for limited-term interests in land so as to apportion equitably the cost of each interest over the life thereof. (For Major utilities, see account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization of Electric Plant Utility, and account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant. For Nonmajor utilities, see account 404.)

9.
Equipment.
A. The cost of equipment chargeable to the electric plant accounts, unless otherwise indicated in the text of an equipment account, includes the net purchase price thereof, sales taxes, investigation and inspection expenses necessary to such purchase, expenses of transportation when borne by the utility, labor employed, materials and supplies consumed, and expenses incurred by the utility in unloading and placing the equipment in readiness to operate. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of plant.
B. Exclude from equipment accounts hand and other portable tools, which are likely to be lost or stolen or which have relatively small value (for example, $500 or less) or short life, unless the correctness of the accounting therefor as electric plant is verified by current inventories. Special tools acquired and included in the purchase price of equipment shall be included in the appropriate plant account. Portable drills and similar tool equipment when used in connection with the operation and maintenance of a particular plant or department, such as production, transmission, distribution, etc., or in
stores,
shall be charged to the plant account appropriate for their use.
C. The equipment accounts shall include angle irons and similar items which are installed at the base of an item of equipment, but piers and foundations which are designed to be as permanent as the buildings which house the equipment, or which are constructed as a part of the building and which cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings or floors or without in some way impairing the building, shall be included in the building accounts.
D. The equipment accounts shall include the necessary costs of testing or running a plant or parts thereof during an experimental or test period prior to such plant becoming ready for or placed in service. In the case of Nonmajor utilities, the utility shall pay the fee prescribed in part 381 of this chapter and shall furnish the Commission with full particulars of and
justification for any test or experimental run extending beyond a period of 30 days. In the case of Major utilities, the utility shall furnish the Commission with full particulars of and justification for any test or experimental run extending beyond a period of 120 days for nuclear plant, and a period of 90 days for all other plant. Such particulars shall include a detailed operational and downtime log showing days of production, gross kilowatts generated by hourly increments, types, and periods of outages by hours with explanation thereof, beginning with the first date the equipment was either tested or synchronized on the line to the end of the test period.
E. The cost of efficiency or other tests made subsequent to the date equipment becomes available for service shall be charged to the appropriate expense accounts, except that tests to determine whether equipment meets the specifications and requirements as to efficiency, performance, etc., guaranteed by manufacturers, made after operations have commenced and within the period specified in the agreement or contract of purchase may be charged to the appropriate electric plant account.
10.
Additions and Retirements of Electric Plant.
A. For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of electric plant, all property will be considered as consisting of (1) retirement units and (2) minor items of property. Each utility shall maintain a written property units listing for use in accounting for additions and retirements of electric plant and apply the listing consistently.
B. The addition and retirement of retirement units shall be accounted for as follows:
(1) When a retirement unit is added to electric plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the appropriate electric plant account, except that when units are acquired in the acquisition of any electric plant constituting an operating system, they shall be accounted for as provided in electric plant instruction 5.
(2) When a retirement unit is retired from electric plant, with or without replacement, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in which it is included, determined in the manner set forth in paragraph D, below. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and credited to electric plant shall be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation applicable to such property. The cost of removal and the salvage shall be charged or credited, as appropriate, to such depreciation account.
C. The addition and retirement of minor items of property shall be accounted for as follows:
(1) When a minor item of property which did not previously exist is added to plant, the cost thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as for the addition of a retirement unit, as set forth in paragraph B(1), above, if a substantial addition results, otherwise the charge shall be to the appropriate maintenance expense account.
(2) When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of depreciable plant, the account for accumulated provision for depreciation shall be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when such unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when such minor item is retired.
(3) When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the item, except that if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more efficient, of greater durability, or of greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment shall be charged to the appropriate electric plant account.
D. The book cost of electric plant retired shall be the amount at which such property is included in the electric plant accounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost shall be determined from the utility's records and if this cannot be done it shall be estimated.

If the work is abandoned, the charge shall be to account 426.5, Other Deductions, or to the appropriate operating expense accounts.
(2) Undistributed balances in clearing accounts at the date of the balance sheet. Balances in clearing accounts shall be substantially cleared not later than the end of the calendar year unless items held therein related to a future period.

Such credit to this account and debit to account 410.1 or 410.2 shall, in general, represent the effect on taxes payable in the current year of the smaller amount of book income recognized for tax purposes as compared to the amount recognized in the utility's current accounts with respect to the item or class of items for which deferred tax accounting by the utility was authorized by the Commission.
C. Vintage year records with respect to entries to this account, as described above, and the account balance, shall be so maintained as to show the factor of calculation with respect to each annual amount of the item or class of items for which deferred tax accounting by the utility is utilized.
