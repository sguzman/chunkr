refers to title 40, part 60, section 500.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# INQUIRIES
For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at the top of odd-numbered pages.

[48 FR 37590, Aug. 18, 1983, as amended at 65 FR 61763, Oct. 17, 2000; 68 FR 70965, Dec. 19, 2003]
§ 60.502
Standard for Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions from bulk gasoline terminals.
On and after the date on which § 60.8(a) requires a performance test to be completed, the owner or operator of each bulk gasoline terminal containing an affected facility shall comply with the requirements of this section.
(a) Each affected facility shall be equipped with a vapor collection system designed to collect the total organic compounds vapors displaced from tank trucks during product loading.
(b) The emissions to the atmosphere from the vapor collection system due to the loading of liquid product into gasoline tank trucks are not to exceed 35 milligrams of total organic compounds per liter of gasoline loaded, except as noted in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) For each affected facility equipped with an existing vapor processing system, the emissions to the atmosphere from the vapor collection system due to the loading of liquid product into gasoline tank trucks are not to exceed 80 milligrams of total organic compounds per liter of gasoline loaded.
(d) Each vapor collection system shall be designed to prevent any total organic compounds vapors collected at one loading rack from passing to another loading rack.
(e) Loadings of liquid product into gasoline tank trucks shall be limited to vapor-tight gasoline tank trucks using the following procedures:
(1) The owner or operator shall obtain the vapor tightness documentation described in § 60.505(b) for each gasoline tank truck which is to be loaded at the affected facility.
(2) The owner or operator shall require the tank identification number to be recorded as each gasoline tank truck is loaded at the affected facility.
(3)(i) The owner or operator shall cross-check each tank identification number obtained in paragraph (e)(2) of this section with the file of tank vapor tightness documentation within 2 weeks after the corresponding tank is loaded, unless either of the following conditions is maintained:
(A) If less than an average of one gasoline tank truck per month over the last 26 weeks is loaded without vapor tightness documentation then the documentation cross-check shall be performed each quarter; or
(B) If less than an average of one gasoline tank truck per month over the last 52 weeks is loaded without vapor tightness documentation then the documentation cross-check shall be performed semiannually.
(ii) If either the quarterly or semiannual cross-check provided in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) (A) through (B) of this section reveals that these conditions were not maintained, the source must return to biweekly monitoring until such time as these conditions are again met.
(4) The terminal owner or operator shall notify the owner or operator of each non-vapor-tight gasoline tank truck loaded at the affected facility within 1 week of the documentation
cross-check in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(5) The terminal owner or operator shall take steps assuring that the nonvapor-tight gasoline tank truck will not be reloaded at the affected facility until vapor tightness documentation for that tank is obtained.
(6) Alternate procedures to those described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section for limiting gasoline tank truck loadings may be used upon application to, and approval by, the Administrator.
(f) The owner or operator shall act to assure that loadings of gasoline tank trucks at the affected facility are made only into tanks equipped with vapor collection equipment that is compatible with the terminal's vapor collection system.
(g) The owner or operator shall act to assure that the terminal's and the tank truck's vapor collection systems are connected during each loading of a gasoline tank truck at the affected facility. Examples of actions to accomplish this include training drivers in the hookup procedures and posting visible reminder signs at the affected loading racks.
(h) The vapor collection and liquid loading equipment shall be designed and operated to prevent gauge pressure in the delivery tank from exceeding 4,500 pascals (450 mm of water) during product loading. This level is not to be exceeded when measured by the procedures specified in § 60.503(d).

(j) Each calendar month, the vapor collection system, the vapor processing system, and each loading rack handling gasoline shall be inspected during the loading of gasoline tank trucks for total organic compounds liquid or vapor leaks. For purposes of this paragraph, detection methods incorporating sight, sound, or smell are acceptable. Each detection of a leak shall be recorded and the source of the leak repaired within 15 calendar days after it is detected.
[48 FR 37590, Aug. 18, 1983; 48 FR 56580, Dec. 22, 1983, as amended at 54 FR 6678, Feb. 14, 1989; 64 FR 7466, Feb. 12, 1999]
§ 60.503
Test methods and procedures.
(a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b). The three-run requirement of § 60.8(f) does not apply to this subpart.
(b) Immediately before the performance test required to determine compliance with § 60.502 (b), (c), and (h), the owner or operator shall use Method 21 to monitor for leakage of vapor all potential sources in the terminal's vapor collection system equipment while a gasoline tank truck is being loaded. The owner or operator shall repair all leaks with readings of 10,000 ppm (as methane) or greater before conducting the performance test.
(c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the standards in § 60.502 (b) and (c) as follows:
(1) The performance test shall be 6 hours long during which at least 300,000 liters of gasoline is loaded. If this is not possible, the test may be continued the same day until 300,000 liters of gasoline is loaded or the test may be resumed the next day with another complete 6-hour period. In the latter case, the 300,000-liter criterion need not be met. However, as much as possible, testing should be conducted during the 6-hour period in which the highest throughput normally occurs.
(2) If the vapor processing system is intermittent in operation, the performance test shall begin at a reference vapor holder level and shall end at the same reference point. The test shall include at least two startups and shutdowns of the vapor processor. If this does not occur under automatically controlled operations, the system shall be manually controlled.
(3) The emission rate (E) of total organic compounds shall be computed using the following equation:
EC16NO91.063
where:
E = emission rate of total organic compounds, mg/liter of gasoline loaded.
V
esi
= volume of air-vapor mixture exhausted at each interval “i”, scm.
C
ei
= concentration of total organic compounds at each interval “i”, ppm.
L = total volume of gasoline loaded, liters.
n = number of testing intervals.
i = emission testing interval of 5 minutes.
K = density of calibration gas, 1.83 × 10
6
for propane and 2.41 × 10
6
for butane, mg/scm.
(4) The performance test shall be conducted in intervals of 5 minutes. For each interval “i”, readings from each measurement shall be recorded, and the volume exhausted (V
esi
) and the corresponding average total organic compounds concentration (C
ei
) shall be determined. The sampling system response time shall be considered in determining the average total organic compounds concentration corresponding to the volume exhausted.
(5) The following methods shall be used to determine the volume (V
esi
) air-vapor mixture exhausted at each interval:
(i) Method 2B shall be used for combustion vapor processing systems.
(ii) Method 2A shall be used for all other vapor processing systems.
(6) Method 25A or 25B shall be used for determining the total organic compounds concentration (C
ei
) at each interval. The calibration gas shall be either propane or butane. The owner or operator may exclude the methane and ethane content in the exhaust vent by any method (e.g., Method 18) approved by the Administrator.
(7) To determine the volume (L) of gasoline dispensed during the performance test period at all loading racks whose vapor emissions are controlled by the processing system being tested, terminal records or readings from gasoline dispensing meters at each loading rack shall be used.
(d) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the standard in § 60.502(h) as follows:
(1) A pressure measurement device (liquid manometer, magnehelic gauge, or equivalent instrument), capable of measuring up to 500 mm of water gauge pressure with ±2.5 mm of water precision, shall be calibrated and installed on the terminal's vapor collection system at a pressure tap located as close as possible to the connection with the gasoline tank truck.
(2) During the performance test, the pressure shall be recorded every 5 minutes while a gasoline truck is being loaded; the highest instantaneous pressure that occurs during each loading shall also be recorded. Every loading position must be tested at least once during the performance test.
(e) The performance test requirements of paragraph (c) of this section do not apply to flares defined in § 60.501 and meeting the requirements in § 60.18(b) through (f). The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the flare and associated vapor collection system is in compliance with the requirements in §§ 60.18(b) through (f) and 60.503(a), (b), and (d).
(f) The owner or operator shall use alternative test methods and procedures in accordance with the alternative test method provisions in § 60.8(b) for flares that do not meet the requirements in § 60.18(b).
[54 FR 6678, Feb. 14, 1989; 54 FR 21344, May 17, 1989, as amended at 68 FR 70965, Dec. 19, 2003]

However, as much as possible, testing should be conducted during the 6-hour period in which the highest throughput of gasoline normally occurs.
(2) If the vapor processing system is intermittent in operation and employs an intermediate vapor holder to accumulate total organic compounds vapors collected from gasoline cargo tanks, the performance test shall begin at a reference vapor holder level and shall end at the same reference point. The test shall include at least two startups and shutdowns of the vapor processor. If this does not occur under automatically controlled operations, the system shall be manually controlled.
(3) The emission rate (E) of total organic compounds shall be computed using the following equation:
ER08MY24.015
Equation 1 to paragraph (c)(3)
Where:
E = emission rate of total organic compounds, mg/liter of gasoline loaded.

6
for propane, mg/scm.
(4) The performance test shall be conducted in intervals of 5 minutes. For each interval “i”, readings from each measurement shall be recorded, and the volume exhausted (V
esi
) and the corresponding average total organic compounds concentration (C
ei
) shall be determined. The sampling system response time shall be accounted for when determining the average total organic compounds concentration corresponding to the volume exhausted.
(5) Method 2B of appendix A-1 to this part shall be used to determine the volume (V
esi
) of air-vapor mixture exhausted at each interval.
(6) Method 25, 25A, or 25B of appendix A-7 to this part shall be used for determining the total organic compounds concentration (C
ei
) at each interval. Method 25 must not be used if the outlet TOC concentration is less than 50 ppmv. The calibration gas shall be propane. If the owner or operator conducts the performance test using either Method 25A or Method 25B, the methane content in the exhaust vent may be excluded following the procedures in paragraphs (c)(6)(i) through (v) of this section. Alternatively, an instrument that uses gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector may be used according to the procedures in paragraph (c)(6)(vi) of this section.

Use a direct interface and heated sampling line from the sampling point to the gas chromatographic injection valve. All sampling components leading to the analyzer must be heated to greater than 110 °C. Calibrate the instrument with propane. Calibration error and calibration drift must be demonstrated according to Method 25A, and the appropriate procedures in Method 25A must be followed to ensure the calibration error and calibration drift are within Method 25A limits. The TOC concentration minus methane must be recorded at least once every 15 minutes.

(iii) Starting at the end of the third hour of the performance test and at the end of each successive hour, calculate the 3-hour rolling average temperature using the 1-hour average values in paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section. For a 6-hour test, this would result in four 3-hour averages (averages for hours 1 through 3, 2 through 4, 3 through 5, and 4 through 6).
(iv) Set the operating limit at the lowest 3-hour average temperature determined in paragraph (c)(8)(iii) of this section. New operating limits become effective on the date that the performance test report is submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI), per the requirements of § 60.505a(b).

Follow the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 to this part, section 10.1, except do not adjust the meter readout to correspond to the calibration gas value. If multiple scales are used, record the instrument reading for each scale used. Divide the arithmetic difference of the initial and post-test calibration response by the corresponding calibration gas value for each scale and multiply by 100 to express the calibration drift as a percentage. If a calibration drift assessment shows a negative drift of more than 10 percent, then re-monitor all equipment monitored since the last calibration with instrument readings between the leak definition and the leak definition multiplied by (100 minus the percent of negative drift) divided by 100. If any calibration drift assessment shows a positive drift of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then, at the owner/operator's discretion, all equipment with instrument readings above the leak definition and below the leak definition multiplied by (100 plus the percent of positive drift)

(e)
Requirements for electronically submitting reports.
For reports required to be submitted following the procedures specified in this paragraph (e), you must submit reports to the EPA via CEDRI, which can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
https://cdx.epa.gov/
). The EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to you. Do not use CEDRI to submit information you claim as confidential business information (CBI). Although we do not expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if you wish to assert a CBI claim for some of the information in the report, you must submit a complete file in the format specified in this subpart, including information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA following the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed CBI. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c), emissions data are not entitled to confidential treatment, and the EPA is required to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available. You must submit the same file submitted to the CBI office with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (e).
(1) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the OAQPS CBI Office at the email address
oaqpscbi@epa.gov,
and as described above, should include clear CBI markings. ERT files should be flagged to the attention of the Group Leader,
Measurement Policy Group; all other files should be flagged to the attention of the Gasoline Distribution Sector Lead. If assistance is needed with submitting large electronic files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments, and if you do not have your own file sharing service, please email
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
to request a file transfer link.
(2) If you cannot transmit the file electronically, you may send CBI information through the postal service to the following address: U.S. EPA, Attn: OAQPS Document Control Officer, Mail Drop: C404-02, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, P.O. Box 12055, RTP, NC 27711. ERT files should be flagged to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, and all other files should also be flagged to the attention of the Gasoline Distribution Sector Lead. The mailed CBI material should be double wrapped and clearly marked. Any CBI markings should not show through the outer envelope.
(f)
Claims of EPA system outage.
If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with that reporting requirement. To assert a claim of EPA system outage, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (f)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) You must have been or will be precluded from accessing CEDRI and submitting a required report within the time prescribed due to an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems.
(2) The outage must have occurred within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date that the submission is due.
(3) The outage may be planned or unplanned.
(4) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(5) You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying:
(i) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to EPA system outage;
(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.
(6) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(7) In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved.
(g)
Claims of force majeure.
If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of
force majeure
for failure to timely comply with that reporting requirement. To assert a claim of
force majeure,
you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) You may submit a claim if a
force majeure
event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the purposes of this section, a
force majeure
event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage).
(2) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(3) You must provide to the Administrator:
(i) A written description of the
force majeure
event;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the
force majeure
event;
(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.
(4) The decision to accept the claim of
force majeure
and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(5) In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the
force majeure
event occurs.

§ 60.534
What test methods and procedures must I use to determine compliance with the standards and requirements for certification?
Test methods and procedures specified in this section or in appendices of this part, except as provided under § 60.8(b), must be used to determine compliance with the standards and requirements for certification under §§ 60.532 and 60.533 and for reporting carbon monoxide emissions and efficiency as follows:
(a)(1) For affected wood heaters subject to the 2015 and 2020 particulate matter emission standards of §§ 60.532(a) and (b), the manufacturer must have an EPA-approved test laboratory conduct testing according to paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. The manufacturer or manufacturer's authorized representative must submit a summary and the full test reports with all supporting information, including detailed discussion of all anomalies, whether all burn rate categories were properly achieved, any data not used in the calculations and, for any test runs not completed, the data that were collected and the reason that the test run was not completed. The burn rate for the low burn rate category must be no greater than the rate that an operator can achieve in home use and no greater than is advertised by the manufacturer or retailer. The manufacturer has the option of submitting test results obtained pursuant to either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section to the Administrator as specified under § 60.537 as part of a request for a certification of compliance.
(i) Conduct testing with crib wood using EPA Method 28R of appendix A-8 of this part or an alternative crib wood test method approved by the Administrator or the ASTM E2779-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) pellet heater test method to establish the certification test conditions and the particulate matter emission values.
(ii) Conduct testing with cord wood using an alternative cord wood test method approved by the Administrator to establish the certification test conditions and the particulate matter emission values.
(2) For the 2020 cord wood alternative means of compliance option specified
in § 60.532(c), the manufacturer must have an EPA-approved test laboratory conduct testing with cord wood using an alternative cord wood test method approved by the Administrator to establish the certification test conditions and the particulate matter emission values.
(b) [Reserved]
(c) For affected wood heaters subject to the 2015 and 2020 particulate matter emission standards specified in § 60.532(a) through (c), particulate matter emission concentrations must be measured with ASTM E2515-11 (IBR, see § 60.17) with the following exceptions: eliminate section 9.6.5.1 of ASTM E2515-11 and perform the post-test leak checks as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Additionally, if a component change of either sampling train is needed during sampling, then perform the leak check specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Four-inch filters and Teflon membrane filters or Teflon-coated glass fiber filters may be used in ASTM E2515-11.
(1)
Post-test leak check.
A leak check of each sampling train is mandatory at the conclusion of each sampling run before sample recovery. The leak check must be performed in accordance with the procedures of ASTM E2515-11, section 9.6.4.1 (IBR, see § 60.17), except that it must be conducted at a vacuum equal to or greater than the maximum value reached during the sampling run. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.0003 m
3
/min (0.01 cfm) or 4% of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the leak check results are acceptable. If a higher leakage rate is obtained, the sampling run is invalid.
(2)
Leak checks during sample run.
If, during a sampling run, a component (
e.g.,
filter assembly) change becomes necessary, a leak check must be conducted immediately before the change is made. Record the sample volume before and after the leak test. The sample volume collected during any leak checks must not be included in the total sample volume for the test run. The leak check must be done according to the procedure outlined in ASTM E2515-11, section 9.6.4.1 (IBR, see § 60.17), except that it must be done at a vacuum equal to or greater than the maximum value recorded up to that point in the sampling run. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.0003 m
3
/min (0.01 cfm) or 4% of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the leak check results are acceptable. If a higher leakage rate is obtained, the sampling run is invalid.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
c

# ):
Immediately after component changes, leak checks are optional but highly recommended. If such leak checks are done, the procedure in paragraph (c)(1) of this section should be used.
(d) For all tests conducted using ASTM E2515-11 (IBR, see § 60.17), with the exceptions described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, and pursuant to this section, the manufacturer and approved test laboratory must also measure the first hour of particulate matter emissions for each test run by sampling with a third, identical and independent sampling train operated concurrently for the first hour of PM paired train compliance testing according to paragraph (c) of this section. The manufacturer and approved test laboratory must report the test results from this third train separately as the first hour emissions.
(e) The manufacturer must have the approved test laboratory measure the efficiency, heat output and carbon monoxide emissions of the tested wood heater using Canadian Standards Administration (CSA) Method B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), section 13.7.
(f) Douglas fir may be used in ASTM E2779-10, ASTM E2780-10 and CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17).
(g) The manufacturer of an affected wood heater model line must notify the Administrator of the date that certification testing is scheduled to begin by email to
WoodHeaterReports@epa.gov
. This notice must be received by the EPA at least 30 days before the start of testing. The notification of testing must include the manufacturer's name and physical and email addresses, the approved test laboratory's name and physical and email addresses, the third-party certifier name, the model name and number (or, if unavailable, some other way to distinguish between models), and the dates of testing. The laboratory may substitute certification testing of another affected wood heater
on the original date in order to ensure regular laboratory testing operations.
(h) The approved test laboratory must allow the manufacturer, the manufacturer's approved third-party certifier, the EPA and delegated state regulatory agencies to observe certification testing. However, manufacturers must not involve themselves in the conduct of the test after the pretest burn has begun. Communications between the manufacturer and laboratory or third-party certifier personnel regarding operation of the wood heater must be limited to written communications transmitted prior to the first pretest burn of the certification test series. During certification tests, the manufacturer may communicate with the third-party certifier, and only in writing, to notify them that the manufacturer has observed a deviation from proper test procedures by the laboratory. All communications must be included in the test documentation required to be submitted pursuant to § 60.533(b)(5) and must be consistent with instructions provided in the owner's manual required under § 60.536(g).

(iv) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall have the option of substituting the following procedure as an acceptable alternative to the requirements prescribed under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. This alternative procedure is acceptable only in cases where a single VOC is used and is present in the capture system. The average capture efficiency value derived from a minimum of three runs shall constitute a test.
(A) For each run, “i,” measure the mass of the material containing a single VOC used. This measurement shall be made using a scale that has both a calibration and a readability to within 1 percent of the mass used during the run. This measurement may be made by filling the direct supply reservoir (e.g., trough, tray, or drum that is integral to the operation) and related application equipment (e.g., rollers, pumps, hoses) to a marked level at the start of the run and then refilling to the same mark from a more easily weighed container (e.g., separate supply drum) at the end of the run. The change in mass of the supply drum would equal the mass of material used from the direct supply reservoir. Alternatively, this measurement may be made by weighing the direct supply reservoir at the start and end of the run or by weighing the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start and end of the run. The change in mass would equal the mass of the material used in the run. If only the direct supply reservoir is weighed, the amount of material in or on the related application equipment must be the same at the start and end of the run. All additions of VOC containing material made to the direct supply reservoir during a run must be properly accounted for in determining the mass of material used during that run.
(B) For each run, “i,” measure the mass of the material containing a single VOC which is present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run, unless the ending weight fraction VOC in the material is greater than or equal to 98.5 percent of the starting weight fraction VOC in the material, in which case, this measurement is not required. This measurement may be made directly by emptying the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment and then filling them to a marked level from an easily weighed container (e.g. separate supply drum). The change in mass of the supply drum would equal the mass of material in the filled direct supply reservoir and related application equipment. Alternatively, this measurement may be made by weighing the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run and subtracting the mass of the empty direct supply reservoir and related application equipment (tare weight).
(C) For each run, “i,” the starting weight fraction VOC in the material shall be determined by Method 24 analysis of a sample taken from the direct supply reservoir at the beginning of the run.
(D) For each run, “i,” the ending weight fraction VOC in the material shall be determined by Method 24 analysis of a sample taken from the direct supply reservoir at the end of the run.
(E) For each run, “i,” in which the ending weight fraction VOC in the material is greater than or equal to 98.5 percent of the starting weight fraction VOC in the material, calculate the mass of the single VOC used (Mi) by multiplying the mass of the material used in the run by the starting weight fraction VOC of the material used in the run.
(F) For each run, “i,” in which the ending weight fraction VOC in the material is less than 98.5 percent of the
starting weight fraction VOC in the material, calculate the mass of the single VOC used (M
i
) as follows:
(
1
) Calculate the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run by multiplying the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run by the starting weight fraction VOC in the material for that run.
(
2
) Calculate the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of the run by multiplying the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of the run by the ending weight fraction VOC in the material for that run. The mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of the run shall be calculated by subtracting the mass of material used in the run from the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run.
(
3
) The mass of the single VOC used (M
i
) equals the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run minus the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of the run.
(G) If Method 25A is used to determine the concentration of the single VOC in the capture system, then calculate the capture efficiency (FC
i
) for each run, “i,” as follows:
EC01JN92.042
Where:
C

The monitoring device shall be calibrated and operated according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Temporary enclosure openings shall remain closed at all times except when worker access is necessary.

§ 60.547
Test methods and procedures.
(a) The test methods in appendix A to this part, except as provided under § 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance with § 60.542(a) as follows:
(1) Method 24 or formulation data for the determination of the VOC content of cements or green tire spray materials. In the event of dispute, Method 24 shall be the reference method. For Method 24, the cement or green tire spray sample shall be a 1-liter sample collected in a 1-liter container at a
point where the sample will be representative of the material as applied in the affected facility.
(2) Method 25 as the reference method for the determination of the VOC concentrations in each stack, both entering and leaving an emission control device. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 30 days in advance of any test by Method 25. For Method 25, the sampling time for each of three runs shall be at least 1 hour. Method 1 shall be used to select the sampling site, and the sampling point shall be the centroid of the duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 1.0 meter (3.3 feet). The minimum sample volume shall be 0.003 dry standard cubic meter (dscm) (0.11 dry standard cubic feet (dscf)) except that shorter sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by process variables or other factors, may be approved by the Administrator.
(3) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate, as the reference method for determination of the flow rate of the stack gas. The measurement site shall be the same as for the Method 25 sampling. A velocity traverse shall be made once per run within the hour that the Method 25 sample is taken.
(4) Method 4 for determination of stack gas moisture.
(5) Method 25 or Method 25A for determination of the VOC concentration in a capture system prior to a control device when only a single VOC is present (see § 60.543 (f)(2)(iv)(G) and (f)(2)(iv)(H)). The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 30 days in advance of any test by either Method 25 or Method 25A. Method 1 shall be used to select the sampling site and the sampling point shall be the centroid of the duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 1.0 meter (3.3 feet). Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate, shall be used as the test method for the concurrent determination of gas flow rate in the capture system.
(i) For Method 25, the sampling time for each run shall be at least 1 hour. For each run, a concurrent sample shall be taken immediately upwind of the application area to determine the background VOC concentration of air drawn into the capture system. Subtract this reading from the reading obtained in the capture system for that run. The minimum sample volume shall be 0.003 dry standard cubic meter (dscm) (0.11 dry standard cubic feet (dscf)) except that shorter sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by process variable or other factors, may be approved by the Administrator. Use Method 3 to determine the moisture content of the stack gas.
(ii) For Method 25A, the sampling time for each run shall be at least 1 hour. Instrument calibration shall be performed by the procedure given in Method 25A using the single VOC present in the capture system. A different calibration gas may be used if the results are corrected using an experimentally determined response factor comparing the alternative calibration gas to the single VOC used in the process. After the instrument has been calibrated, determine the background VOC concentration of the air drawn into the capture system immediately upwind of the application area for each run. The instrument does not need to be recalibrated for the background measurement. Subtract this reading from the reading obtained in the capture system for that run. The Method 25A results shall only be used in the alternative procedure for determination of capture efficiency described under § 60.543(f)(2)(iv)(G).

§ 60.560
Applicability and designation of affected facilities.
(a)
Affected facilities.
The provisions of this subpart apply to affected facilities involved in the manufacture of polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, or poly (ethylene terephthalate) as defined in § 60.561 of this subpart. The affected facilities designated below for polypropylene and polyethylene are inclusive of all equipment used in the manufacture of these polymers, beginning with raw materials preparation and ending with product storage, and cover all emissions emanating from such equipment.
(1) For process emissions from any polypropylene and polyethylene manufacturing process that uses a continuous process, the affected facilities are each of the following process sections: each raw materials preparation section, each polymerization reaction section, each material recovery section, each product finishing section, and each product storage section. These process sections are affected facilities for process emissions that are emitted continuously and for process emissions that are emitted intermittently.
(2) For process emissions from polystyrene manufacturing processes that use a continuous process, the affected facilities are each material recovery section. These process sections are affected facilities for only those process emissions that are emitted continuously.
(3) For process emissions from poly(ethylene terephthalate) manufacturing processes that use a continuous process, the affected facilities are each polymerization reaction section. If the process uses dimethyl terephthalate, then each material recovery section is also an affected facility. If the process uses terephthalic acid, then each raw materials preparation section is also an affected facility. These process sections are affected facilities for only those process emissions that are emitted continuously.
(4) For VOC emissions from equipment leaks from polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene (including expandable polystyrene) manufacturing processes, the affected facilities are each group of fugitive emissions equipment (as defined in § 60.561) within any process unit (as defined in § 60.561). This subpart does not apply to VOC emissions from equipment leaks from poly(ethylene terephthalate) manufacturing processes.
(i) Affected facilities with a design capacity to produce less than 1,000 Mg/yr (1,102 ton/yr) shall be exempt from § 60.562-2.
(ii) Addition or replacement of equipment for the purposes of improvement which is accomplished without a capital expenditure shall not by itself be considered a modification under § 60.562-2.
(b)
Applicability dates.
The applicability date identifies when an affected facility becomes subject to a standard. Usually, a standard has a single applicability date. However, some polypropylene and polyethylene affected facilities have a September 30, 1987, applicability date and others have a January 10, 1989, applicability date. The following paragraphs identify the applicability dates for all affected facilities subject to this subpart.
(1)
Polypropylene and polyethylene.
Each process section in a polypropylene or polyethylene production process is a potential affected facility for both continuous and intermittent emissions. The applicability date depends on when the process section was constructed, modified, or reconstructed and, in some instances, on the type of production process.
(i) The applicability date for any polypropylene or polyethylene affected facility that is constructed, modified, or reconstructed after January 10, 1989, regardless of the type of production process being used, is January 10, 1989.
(ii) Only some polypropylene or polyethylene process sections that are constructed, modified, or reconstructed on or before January 10, 1989, but after September 30, 1987, are affected facilities. These process sections (and the
type of emissions to be controlled) are identified by an “x” in table 1. The applicability date for the process sections (and the emissions to be controlled) that are identified by an “x” in table 1 is September 30, 1987. Since the affected facilities that have a September 30, 1987, applicability date are determined by the type of production process (e.g., liquid phase, gas phase), each owner or operator shall identify the particular production process that applies to his or her particular process.

Emission rate applies to intermittent emissions only.
d
Total emission rate for non-emergency intermittent emissions from raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, material recovery, product finishing, and product storage process sections.

(e)(1) Modified or reconstructed affected facilities at polystyrene and poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants with uncontrolled emission rates at or below those identified in table 2 are exempt from the requirements of § 60.562-1 unless and until its uncontrolled emission rate exceeds that rate listed for it in table 2. This exemption does not apply to new polystyrene or poly(ethylene terephthalate) affected facilities.
(2) Emissions from modified or reconstructed affected facilities that are controlled by an existing control device and that have uncontrolled emission rates greater than the uncontrolled threshold emission rates identified in table 2 are exempt from the requirements of § 60.562-1 unless and until the existing control device is modified, reconstructed, or replaced.

means, for the purposes of these standards, an intermittent emission that results from a decomposition, attempts to prevent decompositions, power failure, equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gases from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage. This includes intermittent vents that occur from process equipment where normal operating parameters (e.g., pressure or temperature) are exceeded such that the process equipment can not be returned to normal operating conditions using the design features of the system and venting must occur to avoid equipment failure or adverse safety personnel consequences and to minimize adverse effects of the runaway reaction. This does not include intermittent vents that are designed into the process to maintain normal operating conditions of process vessels including those vents that regulate normal process vessel pressure.
End finisher

Material recovery section
means the equipment that recovers unreacted or by-product materials from any process section for return to the process line, off-site purification or treatment, or sale. Equipment designed to separate unreacted or by-product material from the polymer product are to be included
in this process section, provided at least some of the material is recovered for reuse in the process, off-site purification or treatment, or sale, at the time the process section becomes an affected facility. Otherwise such equipment are to be assigned to one of the other process sections, as appropriate. Equipment that treats recovered materials are to be included in this process section, but equipment that also treats raw materials are not to be included in this process section. The latter equipment are to be included in the raw materials preparation section. If equipment is used to return unreacted or by-product material directly to the same piece of process equipment from which it was emitted, then that equipment is considered part of the process section that contains the process equipment. If equipment is used to recover unreacted or by-product material from a process section and return it to another process section or a different piece of process equipment in the same process section or sends it off-site for purification, treatment, or sale, then such equipment are considered part of a material recovery section. Equipment used for the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants, however, are not included in the material recovery section, but are covered under the standards applicable to the polymerization reaction section (§ 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(A) or (2)(ii)(A)).

Only operating days shall be used in determining compliance with the standards specified in § 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), and (2)(ii)(C). Any calendar day in which equipment is used for less than 8 hours or one labor shift, whichever is less, is not an “operating day” and shall not be used as part of the rolling 14-day period for determining compliance with the standards specified in § 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), and (2)(ii)(C).

means the manufacturing of poly(ethylene terephthalate) based on the esterification reaction of terephthalic acid (TPA) with ethylene glycol to form the intermediate monomer bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate (BHET) that is subsequently polymerized to form PET.
Polymerization reaction section
means the equipment designed to cause monomer(s) to react to form polymers, including equipment designed primarily to cause the formation of short polymer chains (oligomers or low polymers), but not including equipment designed to prepare raw materials for polymerization, e.g., esterification vessels. For the purposes of these standards, the polymerization reaction section begins with the equipment used to transfer the materials from the raw materials preparation section and ends with the last vessel in which polymerization occurs. Equipment used for the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants, however, are included in this process section, rather than in the material recovery process section.
Polypropylene (PP)
means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer comprised of at least 50 percent propylene by weight.
Polystyrene (PS)
means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer comprised of at least 80 percent styrene or para-methylstyrene by weight.

formed in a suspension process, washed, dried, or otherwise finished and then added with a blowing agent to another reactor in which the beads and blowing agent are reacted to produce expandable polystyrene.
Process heater
means a device that transfers heat liberated by burning fuel to fluids contained in tubular coils, including all fluids except water that is heated to produce steam.
Process line
means a group of equipment assembled that can operate independently if supplied with sufficient raw materials to produce polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, (general purpose, crystal, or expandable) or poly(ethylene terephthalate) or one of their copolymers. A process line consists of the equipment in the following process sections (to the extent that these process sections are present at a plant): raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, product finishing, product storage, and material recovery.
Process section
means the equipment designed to accomplish a general but well-defined task in polymer production. Process sections include raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, material recovery, product finishing, and product storage and may be dedicated to a single process line or common to more than one process line.

means equipment assembled to perform any of the physical and chemical operations in the production of polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, (general purpose, crystal, or expandable), or poly(ethylene terephthalate) or one of their copolymers. A process unit can operate independently if supplied with sufficient feed or raw materials and sufficient storage facilities for the product. Examples of process units are raw materials handling and monomer recovery.
Product finishing section
means the equipment that treats, shapes, or modifies the polymer or resin to produce the finished end product of the particular facility, including equipment that prepares the product for product finishing. For the purposes of these standards, the product finishing section begins with the equipment used to transfer the polymerized product from the polymerization reaction section and ends with the last piece of equipment that modifies the characteristics of the polymer. Product finishing equipment may accomplish product separation, extruding and pelletizing, cooling and drying, blending, additives introduction, curing, or annealing. Equipment used to separate unreacted or by-product material from the product are to be included in this process section, provided the material separated from the polymer product is not recovered at the time the process section becomes an affected facility. If the material is being recovered, then the separation equipment are to be included in the material recovery section. Product finishing does not include polymerization, the physical mixing of the pellets to obtain a homogenous mixture of the polymer (except as noted below), or the shaping (such as fiber spinning, molding, or fabricating) or modification (such as fiber stretching and crimping) of the finished end product. If physical mixing occurs in equipment located between product finishing equipment (i.e., before all the chemical and physical characteristics have been “set” by virtue of having passed through the last piece of equipment in the product finishing section), then such equipment are to be included in this process section. Equipment used to physically mix the finished product that are located after the last piece of equipment in the product finishing section are part of the product storage section.
Product storage section
means the equipment that is designed to store the finished polymer or resin end product of the particular facility. For the purposes of these standards, the product storage section begins with the equipment used to transfer the finished product out of the product finishing section and ends with the containers used to store the final product. Any equipment used after the product finishing section to recover unreacted or by-product material are to be considered part of a material recovery section. Product storage does not include any intentional modification of the characteristics of any polymer or resin product, but does include equipment that provide a uniform mixture of product, provided such equipment are used after the last product finishing
piece of equipment. This process section also does not include the shipment of a finished polymer or resin product to another facility for further finishing or fabrication.
Raw materials preparation section
means the equipment located at a polymer manufacturing plant designed to prepare raw materials, such as monomers and solvents, for polymerization. For the purposes of these standards, this process section begins with the equipment used to transfer raw materials from storage and recovered material from material recovery process sections, and ends with the last piece of equipment that prepares the material for polymerization. The raw materials preparation section may include equipment that accomplishes purification, drying, or other treatment of raw materials or of raw and recovered materials together, activation of catalysts, and esterification including the formation of some short polymer chains (oligomers), but does not include equipment that is designed primarily to accomplish the formation of oligomers, the treatment of recovered materials alone, or the storage of raw materials.

§ 60.562-1
Standards: Process emissions.
(a) Polypropylene, low density polyethylene, and high density polyethylene. Each owner or operator of a polypropylene, low density polyethylene, or high density polyethylene process line containing a process section subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions in this section on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by § 60.8 is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial startup whichever comes first.
(1)
Continuous emissions.
For each vent stream that emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in § 60.560(a)(1), the owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section for determining which continuous emissions are to be controlled and which level of control listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is to be met. The owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section each time a process section is constructed, modified, or reconstructed at the plant site.
(i)
Level of control
Continuous emission streams determined to be subject to control pursuant to the procedures identified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, as applicable, shall meet one of the control levels identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) (A) through (D) of this section. The procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section identify which level of control may be met. The level of control identified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section is limited to certain continuous emission streams, which are identified through the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
(A) Reduce emissions of total organic compounds (minus methane and ethane) (TOC) by 98 weight percent, or to
a concentration of 20 parts per million by volume (ppmv) on a dry basis, whichever is less stringent. The TOC is expressed as the sum of the actual compounds, not carbon equivalents. If an owner or operator elects to comply with the 20 ppmv standard, the concentration shall include a correction to 3 percent oxygen only when supplemental combustion air is used to combust the vent stream.
(B) Combust the emissions in a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 150 million Btu/hour or greater by introducing the vent stream into the flame zone of the boiler or process heater. (Note: A boiler or process heater of lesser design heat capacity may be used, but must demonstrate compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section.)
(C) Combust the emissions in a flare that meets the conditions specified in § 60.18. If the flare is used to control both continuous and intermittent emissions, the flare shall meet the conditions specified in § 60.18 at all times (i.e., which controlling continuous emissions alone or when controlling both continuous and intermittent emissions).
(D) Vent the emissions to a control device located on the plant site.
(ii)
Uncontrolled Continuous Emissions.
For each vent stream that emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in § 60.560(a)(1) and that is not controlled in an existing control device, the owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in table 3 to identify those continuous emissions from each constructed, modified, or reconstructed affected facility that are to be controlled. The owner shall include in the procedure all uncontrolled continuous vent streams from previously constructed, modified, or reconstructed affected facilities at the plant site each time a process section is constructed, modified, or reconstructed at the plant site. In applying the procedures shown in table 3, the stream characteristics may be either measured or calculated as specified in § 60.564(d). For modified or reconstructed affected facilities, these stream characteristics are to be determined after a modification or reconstruction determination has been made by the Administrator, but before any actual changes have been undertaken, and then again after the actual changes have been made. Figure 1 provides a summary overview of the control determination procedure described in table 3.

(iii) Controlled Continuous Emissions. For each vent stream that emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in § 60.560(a)(1) and that is controlled in an existing control device, each owner or operator shall determine whether the emissions entering the control device are greater
than or equal to the calculated threshold emissions (CTE) level, which is to be calculated using the TOC concentration of the inlet vent stream and the equations in footnote b of table 3. If the inlet stream's TOC concentration is equal to or greater than 20 weight percent, the calculated threshold emissions level is 18.2 Mg/yr (20.1 ton/yr). If multiple emission streams are vented to the control device, the individual streams are not to be separated into individual weight percent ranges for calculation purposes as would be done for uncontrolled emission streams. Emissions vented to an existing control device are required to be controlled as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. Figure 2 illustrates the control determination procedure for controlled continuous emissions.
EC01JN92.049
(A) If the annual emissions of the stream entering the control device are equal to or greater than the CTE levels, then compliance with one of the requirements identified in § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) is required at such time the control device is reconstructed or replaced or has its operating conditions modified as a result of State or local regulations (including changes in the operating permit) including those instances where the control device is reconstructed, replaced, or modified in its operation at the same time the existing process section
is modified or reconstructed and becomes an affected facility. If the existing control device already complies with one of the requirements identified in § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C), no further control is required.
(B) If the annual emissions of the stream entering the control device are less than the CTE level, then the requirements of § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) are not applicable at that time. However, if the control device is replaced, reconstructed, or modified at a later date, each owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of these standards. This is done by combining with the vent stream entering the control device any uncontrolled vent streams in the same weight percent range as the controlled vent stream and determining whether the annual emissions of the stream entering the control device plus the applicable uncontrolled vent streams are greater than or equal to the CTE level, which is based on the weighted TOC concentration of the controlled vent stream and the uncontrolled vent streams. If the annual emissions entering the control device (including the applicable uncontrolled vent streams) are greater than or equal to the CTE level, then compliance with one of the requirements identified in § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) is required at that time for both the controlled and uncontrolled vent streams. If the annual emissions are less than the CTE level, compliance with these standards is again not required at such time. However, if the control device is again replaced, reconstructed, or modified, each owner or operator shall repeat this determination procedure.
(2)
Intermittent emissions.
The owner or operator shall control each vent stream that emits intermittent emissions from an affected facility as defined in § 60.560-1(a)(1) by meeting one of the control requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. If a vent stream that emits intermittent emissions is controlled in an existing flare, incinerator, boiler, or process heater, the requirements of this paragraph are waived until such time the control device is reconstructed or replaced or is modified in its operating conditions as a result of State or local regulation, including changes in the operating permit. This paragraph does not apply to emergency vent streams exempted by § 60.560(h) and as defined in § 60.561.
(i) Combust the emissions in a flare that is:
(A) Designed for and operated with no visible emissions, except for periods not to exceed a total of 5 minutes during any 2 consecutive hours,
(B) Operated with a flame present at all times, and
(C) Designed to maintain a stable flame.
(ii) Combust the emissions in an incinerator, boiler, or process heater. Such emissions shall be introduced into the flame zone of a boiler or process heater.
(b)
Polystyrene.
Each owner or operator of a polystyrene process line containing process sections subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions in this section on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by § 60.8 is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial startup, whichever comes first. Each owner or operator of a polystyrene process line using a continuous process shall:
(1) Limit the continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery section by complying with one of the following:
(i) Not allow continuous TOC emissions to be greater than 0.0036 kg TOC/Mg (0.0072 lb TOC/ton) product; or
(ii) Not allow the outlet gas stream temperature from each final condenser in the material recovery section to exceed −25 °C (−13 °F). For purposes of this standard, temperature excursions above this limit shall not be considered a violation when such excursions occur during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction; or
(iii) Comply with § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C).
(2) If continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery section are routed through an existing emergency vapor recovery system, then compliance with these standards is required when the emergency vapor recovery
system undergoes modification, reconstruction, or replacement. In such instances, compliance with these standards shall be achieved no later than 180 days after completion of the modification, reconstruction, or replacement.
(c)
Poly(ethylene terephthalate).
Each owner or operator of a poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line containing process sections subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions in this section on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by § 60.8 is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial startup, whichever comes first.

§ 60.562-2
Standards: Equipment leaks of VOC.
(a) Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the requirements specified in §§ 60.482-1 through 60.482-10 as soon as practicable, but no later than 180 days after initial startup, except that indications of liquids dripping from bleed ports in existing pumps in light liquid service are not considered to be a leak as defined in § 60.482-2(b)(2). For purposes of this standard, a “bleed port” is a technologically-required feature of the pump whereby polymer fluid used to provide lubrication and/or cooling of the pump shaft exits the pump, thereby resulting in a visible leak of fluid. This exemption expires when the existing pump is replaced or reconstructed.
(b) An owner or operator may elect to comply with the requirements specified in §§ 60.483-1 and 60.483-2.
(c) An owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for a determination of equivalency for any means of emission limitation that achieves a reduction in emissions of VOC at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of VOC achieved by the controls required in this subpart. In doing so, the owner or operator shall comply with requirements specified in § 60.484.
(d) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions specified in § 60.485 except an owner or operator may use the following provision in addition to § 60.485(e): Equipment is in light liquid service if the percent evaporated is greater than 10 percent at 150 °C (302 °F) as determined by ASTM Method D86-78, 82, 90, 95, or 96 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17).
(e) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with §§ 60.486 and 60.487.

Each three-hour period constitutes a performance test.
(j) For purposes of determining compliance with § 60.562-1(c) (1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), or (2)(ii)(C), the ethylene glycol concentration in either the cooling tower or the liquid effluent from steam-jet ejectors used to produce a vacuum in the polymerization reactors, whichever is applicable, shall be determined:

(i) At least one sample per operating day shall be collected using the grab sampling procedures of ASTM D3370-76 or 96a, “Standard Practices for Sampling Water” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17). An average ethylene glycol concentration by weight shall be calculated on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days, except as provided in paragraphs (j)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section. Each daily average ethylene glycol concentration so calculated constitutes a performance test. Exceedance of the standard during the reduced testing program specified in paragraphs (j)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section is a violation of these standards.
(ii) For those determining compliance with § 60.562-1(c) (1)(ii)(B) or (2)(ii)(B), the owner or operator may elect to reduce the sampling program to any 14 consecutive day period once every two calendar months, if at least seventeen consecutive 14-day rolling average concentrations immediately preceding the reduced sampling program are each less than 0.10 weight percent ethylene glycol. If the average concentration obtained over the 14 day sampling during the reduced testing period exceeds the upper 95 percent confidence interval calculated from the most recent test results in which no one 14-day average exceeded 0.10 weight percent ethylene glycol, then the owner or operator shall reinstitute a daily sampling program. A reduced sampling program can be reinstituted if the requirements specified in this paragraph are met.
(iii) For those determining compliance with § 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(C) or (c)(2)(ii)(C), the owner or operator may elect to reduce the sampling program to any 14 consecutive day period once every two calendar months, if at least seventeen consecutive 14-day rolling average concentrations immediately preceding the reduced sampling program are each less than 1.8 weight percent ethylene glycol. If the average concentration obtained over the 14 day sampling during the reduced test period exceeds the upper 95 percent confidence interval calculated from the most recent test results in which no one 14-day average exceeded 1.8 weight percent ethylene glycol, then the owner or operator shall reinstitute a daily sampling program. A reduced program can be reinstituted if the requirements specified in this paragraph are met.
(iv) The upper 95 percent confidence interval shall be calculated using the equation:
ER17OC00.025
Where:
X
i
= daily ethylene glycol concentration for each day used to calculate the 14-day rolling average used in test results to justify implementing the reduced testing program.
n = number of ethylene glycol concentrations.
(2) Measuring an alternative parameter, such as carbon oxygen demand or biological oxygen demand, that is demonstrated to be directly proportional to
the ethylene glycol concentration. Such parameter shall be measured during the initial 14-day performance test during which the facility is shown to be in compliance with the ethylene glycol concentration standard whereby the ethylene glycol concentration is determined using the procedures described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. The alternative parameter shall be measured on a daily basis and the average value of the alternative parameter shall be calculated on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days. Each daily average value of the alternative parameter constitutes a performance test.

§ 60.583
Test methods and procedures.
(a) Methods in appendix A of this part, except as provided under § 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance with § 60.582(a) as follows:
(1) Method 24 for analysis of inks. If nonphotochemically reactive solvents
are used in the inks, standard gas chromatographic techniques may be used to identify and quantify these solvents. The results of Method 24 may be adjusted to subtract these solvents from the measured VOC content.
(2) Method 25A for VOC concentration (the calibration gas shall be propane);
(3) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses;
(4) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flow rates;
(5) Method 3 for gas analysis;
(6) Method 4 for stack gas moisture.
(b) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.582(a)(1), the owner or operator of an affected facility shall determine the weighted average VOC content of the inks according to the following procedures:
(1) Determine and record the VOC content and amount of each ink used at the print head, including the VOC content and amount of diluent solvent, for any time periods when VOC emission control equipment is not used.
(2) Compute the weighted average VOC content by the following equation:
EC01JN92.050
(3) The weighted average VOC content of the inks shall be calculated over a period that does not exceed one calendar month, or four consecutive weeks. A facility that uses an accounting system based on quarters consisting of two 28 calendar day periods and one 35 calendar day period may use an averaging period of 35 calendar days four times per year, provided the use of such an accounting system is documented in the initial performance test.
(4) Each determination of the weighted average VOC content shall constitute a performance test for any period when VOC emission control equipment is not used. Results of the initial performance test must be reported to the Administrator. Method 24 or ink manufacturers' formulation data along with plant blending records (if plant blending is done) may be used to determine VOC content. The Administrator may require the use of Method 24 if there is a question concerning the accuracy of the ink manufacturer's data or plant blending records.
(5) If, during the time periods when emission control equipment is not used, all inks used contain less than 1.0 kilogram VOC per kilogram ink solids, the owner or operator is not required to calculate the weighted average VOC content, but must verify and record the VOC content of each ink (including any added dilution solvent) used as determined by Method 24, ink manufacturers' formulation data, or plant blending records.
(c) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.582(a)(1), the owner or operator may determine the weighted average VOC content using an inventory system.
(1) The inventory system shall accurately account to the nearest kilogram for the VOC content of all inks and dilution solvent used, recycled, and discarded for each affected facility during the averaging period. Separate records must be kept for each affected facility.
(2) To determine VOC content of inks and dilution solvent used or recycled, Method 24 or ink manufacturers' formulation data must be used in combination with plant blending records (if plant blending is done) or inventory records or purchase records for new inks or dilution solvent.
(3) For inks to be discarded, only Method 24 shall be used to determine the VOC content. Inks to be discarded may be combined prior to measurement of volume or weight and testing by Method 24.
(4) The Administrator may require the use of Method 24 if there is a question concerning the accuracy of the ink manufacturer's data or plant records.
(5) The Administrator shall approve the inventory system of accounting for VOC content prior to the initial performance test.
(d) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.582(a)(2), the owner or operator of an affected facility controlled by a solvent recovery emission control device or an incineration control device shall conduct a performance test to determine overall VOC emission control efficiency according to the following procedures:
(1) The performance test shall consist of three runs. Each test run must last a minimum of 30 minutes and shall continue until the printing operation is interrupted or until 180 minutes of continuous operation occurs. During each test run, the print line shall be printing continuously and operating normally. The VOC emission reduction efficiency achieved for each test run is averaged over the entire test run period.
(2) VOC concentration values at each site shall be measured simultaneously.
(3) The volumetric flow rate shall be determined from one Method 2 measurement for each test run conducted immediately prior to, during, or after that test run. Volumetric flow rates at each site do not need to be measured simultaneously.
(4) In order to determine capture efficiency from an affected facility, all fugitive VOC emissions from the affected facility shall be captured and vented through stacks suitable for measurement. During a performance test, the owner or operator of an affected facility located in an area with other sources of VOC shall isolate the affected facility from other sources of VOC. These two requirements shall be accomplished using one of the following methods:
(i) Build a permanent enclosure around the affected facility;
(ii) Build a temporary enclosure around the affected facility and duplicate, to an extent that is reasonably feasible, the ventilation conditions that are in effect when the affected facility is not enclosed (one way to do this is to divide the room exhaust rate by the volume of the room and then duplicate that quotient or 20 air changes per hour, whichever is smaller, in the temporary enclosure); or
(iii) Shut down all other sources of VOC and continue to exhaust fugitive emissions from the affected facility through any building ventilation system and other room exhausts such as print line ovens and embossers.
(5) For each affected facility, compliance with § 60.582(a)(2) has been demonstrated if the average value of the overall control efficiency (EF) for the three runs is equal to or greater than 85 percent. An overall control efficiency is calculated for each run as follows:
(i) For efficiency of the emission control device,
EC01JN92.051
(ii) For efficiency of the vapor capture system,
EC01JN92.052

§ 60.584
Monitoring of operations and recordkeeping requirements.

Makeup solvent
means the solvent introduced into the affected facility that compensates for solvent lost from the affected facility during the manufacturing process.
Nongaseous losses
means the solvent that is not volatilized during fiber production, and that escapes the process and is unavailable for recovery, or is in a form or concentration unsuitable for economical recovery.
Polymer
means any of the natural or synthetic compounds of usually high molecular weight that consist of many
repeated links, each link being a relatively light and simple molecule.
Precipitation bath

§ 60.603
Performance test and compliance provisions.
(a) Section 60.8(f) does not apply to the performance test procedures required by this subpart.
(b) Each owner or operator of an affected facility shall determine compliance with the applicable standard in § 60.602(a) by determining and recording monthly the VOC emissions per unit mass solvent feed from each affected facility for the current and preceding 5 consecutive calendar months and using these values to calculate the 6-month average emissions. Each calculation is considered a performance test. The owner or operator of an affected facility shall use the following procedure to determine VOC emissions for each calendar month;
(1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices that continuously measure and permanently record for each calendar month the amount of makeup solvent and solvent feed. These values shall be used in calculating VOC emissions according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. All monitoring devices, meters, and peripheral equipment shall be calibrated and any error recorded. Total compounded error of the flow measuring and recording devices shall not exceed 1 percent accuracy over the operating range. As an alternative to measuring solvent feed, the owner or operator may:
(i) Measure the amount of recovered solvent returned to the solvent feed storage tanks, and use the following equation to determine the amount of solvent feed:
Solvent Feed = Makeup Solvent + Recovered
Solvent + Change in the Amount of Solvent
Contained in the Solvent Feed Holding Tank.
(ii) Measure and record the amount of polymer introduced into the affected facility and the solvent-to-polymer ratio of the spinning solutions, and use the following equation to determine the amount of solvent feed:
EC16NO91.083
where subscript “i” denotes each particular spinning solution used during the test period; values of “i” vary from one to the total number of spinning solutions, “n,” used during the calendar month.
(2) VOC emissions shall be determined each calendar month by use of the following equations:
EC16NO91.084
where all values are for the calendar month only and where
E = VOC Emissions, in kg/Mg (lb/ton) solvent;
S
V
= Measured or calculated volume of solvent feed, in liters (gallons);
S
W
= Weight of solvent feed, in Mg (ton);
M
V
= Measured volume of makeup solvent, in liters (gallons);
M
W
= Weight of makeup, in kg (lb);
N = Allowance for nongaseous losses, 13 kg/Mg (26 lb/ton) solvent feed;
S
P
= Fraction of measured volume that is actual solvent (excludes water);
D = Density of the solvent, in kg/liter (lb/gallon);
K = Conversion factor, 1,000 kg/Mg (2,000 lb/ton);
I = Allowance for solvent inventory variation or changes in the amount of solvent contained in the affected facility, in kg/Mg (lb/ton) solvent feed (may be positive or negative);
I
S
= Amount of solvent contained in the affected facility at the beginning of the test period, as determined by the owner or operator, in kg (lb);
I
E
= Amount of solvent contained in the affected facility at the close of the test period, as determined by the owner or operator, in kg (lb).
(3) N, as used in the equation in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, equals 13 kg/Mg (26 lb/ton) solvent feed to the spinning solution preparation system and precipitation bath. This value shall be used in all cases unless an owner or
operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that greater nongaseous losses occur at the affected facility. In this case, the greater value may be substituted in the equation.

§ 60.604
Reporting requirements.
(a) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall submit a written report to the Administrator of the following:
(1) The results of the initial performance test; and
(2) The results of subsequent performance tests that indicate that VOC emissions exceed the standards in § 60.602. These reports shall be submitted quarterly at 3-month intervals after the initial performance test. If no exceedances occur during a particular quarter, a report stating this shall be submitted to the Administrator semiannually.
(b) Solvent-spun synthetic fiber producing facilities exempted from these standards in § 60.600(a) (those producing less than 500 Mg (551 ton) annually) shall report to the Administrator within 30 days whenever extruded fiber for the preceding 12 calendar months exceeds 500 Mg (551 ton).
(c) The requirements of this section remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternate means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with this section, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.

(i) Each owner and operator subject to the provisions of this subpart is exempt from the quarterly reporting requirements contained in § 60.7(c) of the General Provisions.
(j) Each owner or operator that seeks to comply with the requirements of this subpart by complying with the requirements of § 60.612 shall submit to the Administrator semiannual reports of the following information. The initial report shall be submitted within 6 months after the initial start-up-date. On and after July 15, 2025 or once the report template for this subpart has been available on the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) website (
https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/cedri
) for 1 year, whichever date is later, owners and operators must submit all subsequent reports using the appropriate electronic report template on the CEDRI website for this subpart and following the procedure specified in paragraph (m) of this section. The date report templates become available will be listed on the CEDRI website. Unless the Administrator or delegated state agency or other authority has approved a different schedule for submission of reports, the report must be submitted by the deadline specified in this subpart, regardless of the method in which the report is submitted.
(1) Exceedances of monitored parameters recorded under § 60.615(c) and (g).
(2) All periods recorded under § 60.615(d) when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or has no flow rate.
(3) All periods recorded under § 60.615(e) when the boiler or process heater was not operating.
(4) All periods recorded under § 60.615(f) in which the pilot flame of the flare was absent.
(5) Any recalculation of the TRE index value, as recorded under § 60.615(h).
(k) The requirements of § 60.615(j) remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with § 60.615(j), provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State. The EPA will not approve a waiver of electronic reporting to the EPA in delegating enforcement authority. Thus, electronic reporting to the EPA cannot be waived, and as such, the provisions of this paragraph cannot be used to relieve owners or operators of affected facilities of the requirement to submit the electronic reports required in this section to the EPA.
(l) The Administrator will specify appropriate reporting and recordkeeping requirements where the owner or operator of an affected facility seeks to demonstrate compliance with the standards specified under § 60.612 other than as provided under § 60.613(a), (b), (c), and (d).
(m) If an owner or operator is required to submit notifications or reports following the procedure specified in this paragraph (m), the owner or operator must submit notifications or reports to the EPA via CEDRI, which can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
https://cdx.epa.gov/
). The EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to the owner or operator. Do not use CEDRI to submit information the owner or operator claims as CBI. Although the EPA does not expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if an owner or operator wishes to assert a CBI claim for some of the information in the report or notification, the owner or operator must submit a complete file in the format specified in this subpart, including information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA following the procedures in paragraphs (m)(1) and (2) of this section. Clearly mark the part or all of the information claimed to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed CBI. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c), emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment, and the EPA is required
to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available. The owner or operator must submit the same file submitted to the CBI office with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (m).
(1) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the OAQPS CBI Office at the email address
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
, and as described above, should include clear CBI markings. ERT files should be flagged to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group; all other files should be flagged to the attention of the SOCMI NSPS Sector Lead. Owners and operators who do not have their own file sharing service and who require assistance with submitting large electronic files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments should email
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
to request a file transfer link.
(2) If an owner or operator cannot transmit the file electronically, the owner or operator may send CBI information through the postal service to the following address: OAQPS Document Control Officer (C404-02), OAQPS, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, P.O. Box 12055, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711. ERT files should be sent to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, and all other files should be sent to the attention of the SOCMI NSPS Sector Lead. The mailed CBI material should be double wrapped and clearly marked. Any CBI markings should not show through the outer envelope.
(n) Owners and operators required to electronically submit notifications or reports through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal requirement. To assert a claim of EPA system outage, owners and operators must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (n)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator must have been or will be precluded from accessing CEDRI and submitting a required report within the time prescribed due to an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems.
(2) The outage must have occurred within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date that the submission is due.
(3) The outage may be planned or unplanned.
(4) The owner or operator must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(5) The owner or operator must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying:
(i) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to EPA system outage;
(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which the owner or operator proposes to report, or if the owner or operator has already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date the report was submitted.
(6) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(7) In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved.
(o) Owners and operators required to electronically submit notifications or reports through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, owners and operators may assert a claim of
force majeure
for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal requirement. To assert a claim of
force majeure,
you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (o)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) An owner or operator may submit a claim if a
force majeure
event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or
there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the purposes of this section, a
force majeure
event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents the owner or operator from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage).
(2) The owner or operator must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(3) The owner or operator must provide to the Administrator:
(i) A written description of the
force majeure
event;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the
force majeure
event;
(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which the owner or operator proposes to report, or if the owner or operator has already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date the report was submitted.
(4) The decision to accept the claim of
force majeure
and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(5) In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the
force majeure
event occurs.

§ 60.611a
What definitions must I know?
As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act and subpart A of this part.
Air Oxidation Reactor
means any device or process vessel in which one or more organic reactants are combined with air, or a combination of air and oxygen, to produce one or more organic compounds. Ammoxidation and oxychlorination reactions are included in this definition.
Air Oxidation Reactor Recovery Train
means an individual recovery system receiving the vent stream from at least one air oxidation reactor, along with all air oxidation reactors feeding vent streams into this system.
Air Oxidation Unit Process
means a unit process, including ammoxidation and oxychlorination unit process, that uses air, or a combination of air and oxygen, as an oxygen source in combination with one or more organic reactants to produce one or more organic compounds.
Boilers
means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful energy in the form of steam.
Breakthrough
means the time when the level of TOC, measured at the outlet of the first bed, has been detected is at the highest concentration allowed to be discharged from the adsorber system and indicates that the adsorber bed should be replaced.
By Compound
means by individual stream components, not carbon equivalents.
Closed vent system
means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to a control device.
Continuous recorder
means a data recording device recording an instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes.
Flame zone
means the portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler or
process heater occupied by the flame envelope.
Flow indicator
means a device which indicates whether gas flow is present in a vent stream.
Fuel gas
means gases that are combusted to derive useful work or heat.
Fuel gas system
means the offsite and onsite piping and flow and pressure control system that gathers gaseous stream(s) generated by onsite operations, may blend them with other sources of gas, and transports the gaseous stream for use as fuel gas in combustion devices or in in-process combustion equipment such as furnaces and gas turbines either singly or in combination.
Halogenated vent stream
means any vent stream determined to have a total concentration (by volume) of compounds containing halogens of 20 ppmv (by compound) or greater.
Incinerator
means any enclosed combustion device that is used for destroying organic compounds and does not extract energy in the form of steam or process heat.
Pressure-assisted multi-point flare
means a flare system consisting of multiple flare burners in staged arrays whereby the vent stream pressure is used to promote mixing and smokeless operation at the flare burner tips. Pressure-assisted multi-point flares are designed for smokeless operation at velocities up to Mach = 1 conditions (
i.e.,
sonic conditions), can be elevated or at ground level, and typically use cross-lighting for flame propagation to combust any flare vent gases sent to a particular stage of flare burners.
Primary fuel
means the fuel fired through a burner or a number of similar burners. The primary fuel provides the principal heat input to the device, and the amount of fuel is sufficient to sustain operation without the addition of other fuels.
Process heater
means a device that transfers heat liberated by burning fuel to fluids contained in tubes, including all fluids except water that is heated to produce steam.
Process unit
means equipment assembled and connected by pipes or ducts to produce, as intermediates or final products, one or more of the chemicals in § 60.617a. A process unit can operate independently if supplied with sufficient fuel or raw materials and sufficient product storage facilities.
Product
means any compound or chemical listed in § 60.617a that is produced for sale as a final product as that chemical or is produced for use in a process that needs that chemical for the production of other chemicals in another facility. By-products, co-products, and intermediates are considered to be products.
Recovery device
means an individual unit of equipment, such as an absorber, condenser, and carbon adsorber, capable of and used to recover chemicals for use, reuse, or sale.
Recovery system
means an individual recovery device or series of such devices applied to the same process stream.
Relief valve
means a valve used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge results from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.
Total organic compounds (TOC)
means those compounds measured according to the procedures of Method 18 of appendix A-6 to this part or ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) as specified in § 60.614a(b)(4) or the concentration of organic compounds measured according to the procedures in Method 21 or Method 25A of appendix A-7 to this part.
Vent stream
means any gas stream, containing nitrogen which was introduced as air to the air oxidation reactor, released to the atmosphere directly from any air oxidation reactor recovery train or indirectly, after diversion through other process equipment. The vent stream excludes equipment leaks including, but not limited to, pumps, compressors, and valves.
§ 60.612a
What standards and associated requirements must I meet?
(a) You must comply with the emission limits and standards specified in Table 1 to this subpart and the requirements specified paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for each vent stream on
and after the date on which the initial performance test required by §§ 60.8 and 60.614a is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after the initial start-up, whichever date comes first. The standards in this section apply at all times, including periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction. As provided in § 60.11(f), this provision supersedes the exemptions for periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction in the general provisions in subpart A of this part.
(b) The following release events from an affected facility are a violation of the emission limits and standards specified in table 1 to this subpart.
(1) Any relief valve discharge to the atmosphere of a vent stream.
(2) The use of a bypass line at any time on a closed vent system to divert emissions to the atmosphere, or to a control device or recovery device not meeting the requirements specified in § 60.613a.
(c) You may designate a vent stream as a maintenance vent if the vent is only used as a result of startup, shutdown, maintenance, or inspection of equipment where equipment is emptied, depressurized, degassed, or placed into service. You must comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section for each maintenance vent. Any vent stream designated as a maintenance vent is only subject to the maintenance vent provisions in this paragraph (c) and the associated recordkeeping and reporting requirements in § 60.615a(g), respectively.
(1) Prior to venting to the atmosphere, remove process liquids from the equipment as much as practical and depressurize the equipment to either: A flare meeting the requirements of § 60.619a, as applicable, or using any combination of a non-flare control device or recovery device meeting the requirements in Table 1 to this subpart until one of the following conditions, as applicable, is met.
(i) The vapor in the equipment served by the maintenance vent has a lower explosive limit (LEL) of less than 10 percent.
(ii) If there is no ability to measure the LEL of the vapor in the equipment based on the design of the equipment, the pressure in the equipment served by the maintenance vent is reduced to 5 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) or less. Upon opening the maintenance vent, active purging of the equipment cannot be used until the LEL of the vapors in the maintenance vent (or inside the equipment if the maintenance is a hatch or similar type of opening) is less than 10 percent.

(1) Install a continuous parameter monitoring system(s) (CPMS) and monitor the operating parameter(s) applicable to the control device or recovery system as specified in Table 2 to this subpart or established according to paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) Establish the applicable minimum, maximum, or range for the operating parameter limit as specified in Table 3 to this subpart or established according to paragraph (c) of this section by calculating the value(s) as the arithmetic average of operating parameter measurements recorded during the three test runs conducted for the most recent performance test. You may operate outside of the established operating parameter limit(s) during subsequent performance tests in order to establish new operating limits. You must include the updated operating limits with the performance test results submitted to the Administrator pursuant to § 60.615a(b). Upon establishment of a new operating limit, you must thereafter operate under the new operating limit. If the Administrator determines that you did not conduct the performance test in accordance with the applicable requirements or that the operating limit established during the performance test does not correspond to the conditions specified in § 60.614a(a), then you must conduct a new performance test and establish a new operating limit.
(3) Monitor, record, and demonstrate continuous compliance using the minimum frequencies specified in Table 3 to this subpart or established according to paragraph (c) of this section.
(4) Comply with the calibration and quality control requirements as specified in Table 4 to this subpart or established according to paragraph (c) of this section that are applicable to the CPMS used.

(A) The first adsorber in series must be replaced immediately when breakthrough, as defined in § 60.611a, is detected between the first and second adsorber. The original second adsorber (or a fresh canister) will become the new first adsorber and a fresh adsorber will become the second adsorber. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(6)(iii)(A), “immediately” means within 8 hours of the detection of a breakthrough for adsorbers of 55 gallons or less, and within 24 hours of the detection of a breakthrough for adsorbers greater than 55 gallons. You must monitor at the outlet of the first adsorber within 3 days of replacement to confirm it is performing properly.

These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A performance test must be completed with the same time period to verify the recalculated flow value. The performance test is subject to the requirements of § 60.8 of the General Provisions and must be submitted according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Unless the facility qualifies for an exemption under § 60.610a(c), the facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in § 60.612a.
(j) If you are required to submit notifications or reports following the procedure specified in this paragraph (j), you must submit notifications or reports to the EPA via the CEDRI, which can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
https://cdx.epa.gov/
). The EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to you. Do not use CEDRI to submit information you claim as CBI. Although we do not expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if you wish to assert a CBI claim for some of the information in the report or notification, you must submit a complete file in the format specified in this subpart, including information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA following the procedures in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section. Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed CBI. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c), emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment, and the EPA is required to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available. You must submit the same file submitted to the CBI office with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (j).
(1) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the OAQPS CBI Office at the email address
oaqpscbi@epa.gov,
and as described above, should include clear CBI markings. ERT files should be flagged to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group; all other files should be flagged to the attention of the SOCMI NSPS Sector Lead. If assistance is needed with submitting large electronic files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments, and if you do not have your own file sharing service, please email
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
to request a file transfer link.
(2) If you cannot transmit the file electronically, you may send CBI information through the postal service to the following address: OAQPS Document Control Officer (C404-02), OAQPS, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, P.O. Box 12055, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711. ERT files should be sent to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, and all other files should be sent to the attention of the SOCMI NSPS Sector Lead. The mailed CBI material should be double wrapped and clearly marked. Any CBI markings should not show through the outer envelope.
(k) If you are required to electronically submit notifications or reports through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal requirement. To assert a claim of EPA system outage, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (k)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) You must have been or will be precluded from accessing CEDRI and submitting a required report within the time prescribed due to an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems.
(2) The outage must have occurred within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date that the submission is due.
(3) The outage may be planned or unplanned.
(4) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(5) You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying:
(i) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to EPA system outage;
(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.
(6) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(7) In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved.
(l) If you are required to electronically submit notifications or reports through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of
force majeure
for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal requirement. To assert a claim of
force majeure,
you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (l)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) You may submit a claim if a
force majeure
event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the purposes of this section, a
force majeure
event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage).
(2) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(3) You must provide to the Administrator:
(i) A written description of the
force majeure
event;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the
force majeure
event;
(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.
(4) The decision to accept the claim of
force majeure
and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(5) In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the
force majeure
event occurs.
(m) The requirements of paragraph (i) of this section remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with paragraph (i) of this section, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State. The EPA will not approve a waiver of
electronic reporting to the EPA in delegating enforcement authority. Thus, electronic reporting to the EPA cannot be waived, and as such, the provisions of this paragraph cannot be used to relieve owners or operators of affected facilities of the requirement to submit the electronic reports required in this section to the EPA.
(n) If you seek to demonstrate compliance with § 60.610(c)(1), then you must submit to the Administrator, following the procedures in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an initial report including a flow rate measurement using the test methods specified in § 60.614a.
(o) The Administrator will specify appropriate reporting and recordkeeping requirements where the owner or operator of an affected facility seeks to demonstrate compliance with the standards specified under § 60.612a other than as provided under § 60.613a.
(p) Any records required to be maintained by this subpart that are submitted electronically via the EPA's CEDRI may be maintained in electronic format. This ability to maintain electronic copies does not affect the requirement for facilities to make records, data, and reports available upon request to a delegated air agency or the EPA as part of an on-site compliance evaluation.

[Reserved]
§ 60.619a
What are my requirements if I use a flare to comply with this subpart?
(a) If you use a flare to comply with the TOC emission standard specified in Table 1 to this subpart, then you must meet the applicable requirements for flares as specified in §§ 63.670 and 63.671 of this chapter, including the provisions in tables 12 and 13 to part 63, subpart CC, of this chapter, except as specified in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this section. This requirement also applies to any flare using fuel gas from a fuel gas system, of which 50 percent or more of the fuel gas is derived from an affected facility, as determined on an annual average basis. For purposes of compliance with this paragraph (a), the
following terms are defined in § 63.641 of this chapter: Assist air, assist steam, center steam, combustion zone, combustion zone gas, flare, flare purge gas, flare supplemental gas, flare sweep gas, flare vent gas, lower steam, net heating value, perimeter assist air, pilot gas, premix assist air, total steam, and upper steam.
(b) When determining compliance with the pilot flame requirements specified in § 63.670(b) and (g) of this chapter, substitute “pilot flame or flare flame” for each occurrence of “pilot flame.”
(c) When determining compliance with the flare tip velocity and combustion zone operating limits specified in § 63.670(d) and (e) of this chapter, the requirement effectively applies starting with the 15-minute block that includes a full 15 minutes of the flaring event. You are required to demonstrate compliance with the velocity and NHVcz requirements starting with the block that contains the fifteenth minute of a flaring event. You are not required to demonstrate compliance for the previous 15-minute block in which the event started and contained only a fraction of flow.
(d) Instead of complying with § 63.670(o)(2)(i) of this chapter, you must develop and implement the flare management plan no later than startup for a new flare that commenced construction on or after April 25, 2023.
(e) Instead of complying with § 63.670(o)(2)(iii) of this chapter, if required to develop a flare management plan and submit it to the Administrator, then you must also submit all versions of the plan in portable document format (PDF) following the procedures specified in § 60.615a(j).
(f) Section 63.670(o)(3)(ii) of this chapter and all references to it do not apply. Instead, you must comply with the maximum flare tip velocity operating limit at all times.
(g) Substitute “affected facility” for each occurrence of “petroleum refinery.”
(h) Each occurrence of “refinery” does not apply.
(i) If a pressure-assisted multi-point flare is used as a control device, then you must meet the following conditions:
(1) You are not required to comply with the flare tip velocity requirements in of § 63.670(d) and (k) of this chapter;
(2) The NHVcz for pressure-assisted mulit-point flares is 800 Btu/scf;
(3) You must determine the 15-minute block average NHVvg using only the direct calculation method specified in in § 63.670 (l)(5)(ii) of this chapter;
(4) Instead of complying with § 63.670(b) and (g) of this chapter, if a pressure-assisted multi-point flare uses cross-lighting on a stage of burners rather than having an individual pilot flame on each burner, then you must operate each stage of the pressure-assisted multi-point flare with a flame present at all times when regulated material is routed to that stage of burners. Each stage of burners that cross-lights in the pressure-assisted multi-point flare must have at least two pilots with at least one continuously lit and capable of igniting all regulated material that is routed to that stage of burners. Each 15-minute block during which there is at least one minute where no pilot flame is present on a stage of burners when regulated material is routed to the flare is a deviation of the standard. Deviations in different 15-minute blocks from the same event are considered separate deviations. The pilot flame(s) on each stage of burners that use cross-lighting must be continuously monitored by a thermocouple or any other equivalent device used to detect the presence of a flame;
(5) Unless you choose to conduct a cross-light performance demonstration as specified in this paragraph (i)(5), you must ensure that if a stage of burners on the flare uses cross-lighting, that the distance between any two burners in series on that stage is no more than 6 feet when measured from the center of one burner to the next burner. A distance greater than 6 feet between any two burners in series may be used provided you conduct a performance demonstration that confirms the pressure-assisted multi-point flare will cross-light a minimum of three burners and the spacing between the burners and
location of the pilot flame must be representative of the projected installation. The compliance demonstration must be approved by the permitting authority and a copy of this approval must be maintained onsite. The compliance demonstration report must include: a protocol describing the test methodology used, associated test method QA/QC parameters, the waste gas composition and NHVcz of the gas tested, the velocity of the waste gas tested, the pressure-assisted multi-point flare burner tip pressure, the time, length, and duration of the test, records of whether a successful cross-light was observed over all of the burners and the length of time it took for the burners to cross-light, records of maintaining a stable flame after a successful cross-light and the duration for which this was observed, records of any smoking events during the cross-light, waste gas temperature, meteorological conditions (
e.g.,
ambient temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity), and whether there were any observed flare flameouts; and
(6) You must install and operate pressure monitor(s) on the main flare header, as well as a valve position indicator monitoring system for each staging valve to ensure that the flare operates within the proper range of conditions as specified by the manufacturer. The pressure monitor must meet the requirements in table 13 to part 63, subpart CC of this chapter.
(7) If a pressure-assisted multi-point flare is operating under the requirements of an approved alternative means of emission limitations, you must either continue to comply with the terms of the alternative means of emission limitations or comply with the provisions in paragraphs (i)(1) through (6) of this section.
(j) If you choose to determine compositional analysis for net heating value with a continuous process mass spectrometer, then you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (j)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) You must meet the requirements in § 63.671(e)(2) of this chapter. You may augment the minimum list of calibration gas components found in § 63.671(e)(2) with compounds found during a pre-survey or known to be in the gas through process knowledge.
(2) Calibration gas cylinders must be certified to an accuracy of 2 percent and traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards.
(3) For unknown gas components that have similar analytical mass fragments to calibration compounds, you may report the unknowns as an increase in the overlapped calibration gas compound. For unknown compounds that produce mass fragments that do not overlap calibration compounds, you may use the response factor for the nearest molecular weight hydrocarbon in the calibration mix to quantify the unknown component's NHVvg.
(4) You may use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify any unknown components detected with a higher molecular weight than n-pentane.
(5) You must perform an initial calibration to identify mass fragment overlap and response factors for the target compounds.
(6) You must meet applicable requirements in Performance Specification 9 of appendix B of this part, for continuous monitoring system acceptance including, but not limited to, performing an initial multi-point calibration check at three concentrations following the procedure in section 10.1 and performing the periodic calibration requirements listed for gas chromatographs in table 13 to part 63, subpart CC of this chapter, for the process mass spectrometer. You may use the alternative sampling line temperature allowed under Net Heating Value by Gas Chromatograph in table 13 to part 63, subpart CC.
(7) The average instrument calibration error (CE) for each calibration compound at any calibration concentration must not differ by more than 10 percent from the certified cylinder gas value. The CE for each component in the calibration blend must be calculated using equation 1 to this paragraph (j)(7).
Equation 1 to Paragraph (j)(7)
ER16MY24.033
Where:
Cm = Average instrument response (ppm)
Ca = Certified cylinder gas value (ppm)
(k) If you use a gas chromatograph or mass spectrometer for compositional analysis for net heating value, then you may choose to use the CE of NHV
measured
versus the cylinder tag value NHV as the measure of agreement for daily calibration and quarterly audits in lieu of determining the compound-specific CE. The CE for NHV at any calibration level must not differ by more than 10 percent from the certified cylinder gas value. The CE must be calculated using equation 2 to this paragraph (k).

What are my requirements for closed vent systems?
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, you must inspect each closed vent system according to the procedures and schedule specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) Conduct an initial inspection according to the procedures in paragraph
(b) of this section unless the closed vent system is operated and maintained under negative pressure,
(2) Conduct annual inspections according to the procedures in paragraph (b) of this section unless the closed vent system is operated and maintained under negative pressure, and
(3) Conduct annual inspections for visible, audible, or olfactory indications of leaks.
(b) You must inspect each closed vent system according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.
(1) Inspections must be conducted in accordance with Method 21 of appendix A of this part.
(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument must meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 must be for the average composition of the process fluid not each individual volatile organic compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, or other inerts which are not organic hazardous air pollutants or volatile organic compounds, the average stream response factor must be calculated on an inert-free basis.
(ii) If no instrument is available at the plant site that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(3) The detection instrument must be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A of this part.
(4) Calibration gases must be as follows:
(i) Zero air (less than 10 parts per million hydrocarbon in air); and
(ii) Mixtures of methane in air at a concentration less than 2,000 parts per million. A calibration gas other than methane in air may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or if the instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or more of the compounds to be measured in air.
(5) You may elect to adjust or not adjust instrument readings for background. If you elect to not adjust readings for background, all such instrument readings must be compared directly to the applicable leak definition to determine whether there is a leak.
(6) If you elect to adjust instrument readings for background, you must determine the background concentration using Method 21 of appendix A of this part. After monitoring each potential leak interface, subtract the background reading from the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument. The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level must be compared with 500 parts per million for determining compliance.
(c) Leaks, as indicated by an instrument reading greater than 500 parts per million above background or by visual, audio, or olfactory inspections, must be repaired as soon as practicable, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(1) A first attempt at repair must be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected.
(2) Repair must be completed no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected.
(d) Delay of repair of a closed vent system for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown, as defined in § 60.2, or if you determine that emissions resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair. Repair of such equipment must be complete by the end of the next shutdown.
(e) For each closed vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away from the control device and to the atmosphere, you must comply with the provisions of either paragraph (e)(1) or (2), except as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that determines whether vent stream flow is
present at least once every 15 minutes. You must keep hourly records of whether the flow indicator was operating and whether a diversion was detected at any time during the hour, as well as records of the times and durations of all periods when the vent stream is diverted to the atmosphere or the flow indicator is not operating. The flow indicator must be installed at the entrance to any bypass line; or
(2) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure the valve is maintained in the closed position and the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line.
(3) Open-ended valves or lines that use a cap, blind flange, plug, or second valve and follow the requirements specified in § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c) or follow requirements codified in another regulation that are the same as § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c) are not subject to this paragraph (e).
(f) Any parts of the closed vent system that are designated, as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, as unsafe to inspect are exempt from the inspection requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section if:
(1) You determine that the equipment is unsafe to inspect because inspecting personnel would be exposed to an imminent or potential danger as a consequence of complying with paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section; and
(2) You have a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment as frequently as practicable during safe-to-inspect times.
(g) Any parts of the closed vent system are designated, as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, as difficult to inspect are exempt from the inspection requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section if:
(1) You determine that the equipment cannot be inspected without elevating the inspecting personnel more than 2 meters above a support surface; and
(2) You have a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment at least once every 5 years.
(h) You must record the information specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) Identification of all parts of the closed vent system that are designated as unsafe to inspect, an explanation of why the equipment is unsafe to inspect, and the plan for inspecting the equipment.
(2) Identification of all parts of the closed vent system that are designated as difficult to inspect, an explanation of why the equipment is difficult to inspect, and the plan for inspecting the equipment.
(3) For each closed vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away from the control device and to the atmosphere, you must keep a record of the information specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section in addition to the information specified in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section.
(i) Hourly records of whether the flow indicator specified under paragraph (e)(1) of this section was operating and whether a diversion was detected at any time during the hour, as well as records of the times of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or the flow indicator is not operating.
(ii) Where a seal mechanism is used to comply with paragraph (e)(2) of this section, hourly records of flow are not required. In such cases, you must record whether the monthly visual inspection of the seals or closure mechanisms has been done, and you must record the occurrence of all periods when the seal mechanism is broken, the bypass line valve position has changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type configuration has been checked out, and records of any car-seal that has broken.
(iii) For each flow event from a bypass line subject to the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section, you must maintain records sufficient to determine whether or not the detected flow included flow requiring control. For each flow event from a bypass line requiring control that is released either directly to the atmosphere or to a control device not meeting the requirements in this subpart, you must include an estimate of the volume of gas,
the concentration of VOC in the gas and the resulting emissions of VOC that bypassed the control device using process knowledge and engineering estimates.
(4) For each inspection during which a leak is detected, a record of the information specified in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) through (viii) of this section.
(i) The instrument identification numbers; operator name or initials; and identification of the equipment.
(ii) The date the leak was detected and the date of the first attempt to repair the leak.

This test shall be conducted for a duration of no less than 2 weeks during which no less than 50 percent of the dryer loads shall be monitored for their final recovered solvent flow rate. The suggested point for measuring the flow rate of recovered solvent is the outlet of the solvent-water separator. Near the end of the recovery cycle, the entire flow of recovered solvent should be diverted to a graduated cylinder. As the recovered solvent collects in the graduated cylinder, the elapsed time is monitored and recorded in periods of greater than or equal to 1 minute. At the same time, the volume of solvent in the graduated cylinder is monitored and recorded to determine the volume of recovered solvent that is collected during each time period. The recovered solvent flow rate is calculated by dividing the volume of solvent collected per period by the length of time elapsed during the period and converting the result with appropriate factors into units of liters per minute. The recovery cycle and the monitoring procedure should continue until the flow rate of solvent is less than or equal to 0.05 liter per minute. The type of articles cleaned and the total length of the cycle should then be recorded.

§ 60.645
[Reserved]
§ 60.646
Monitoring of emissions and operations.
(a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of § 60.642 (a) or (b) shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices or perform measurements to determine the following operations information on a daily basis:
(1) The accumulation of sulfur product over each 24-hour period: The monitoring method may incorporate the use of an instrument to measure and record the liquid sulfur production rate, or may be a procedure for measuring and recording the sulfur liquid levels in the storage tanks with a level indicator or by manual soundings, with subsequent calculation of the sulfur production rate based on the tank geometry, stored sulfur density, and elapsed time between readings. The method shall be designed to be accurate within ±2 percent of the 24-hour sulfur accumulation.
(2) The H
2
S concentration in the acid gas from the sweetening unit for each 24-hour period: At least one sample per 24-hour period shall be collected and analyzed using the method specified in § 60.644(b)(1). The Administrator may require the owner or operator to demonstrate that the H
2
S concentration obtained from one or more samples over a 24-hour period is within ±20 percent of the average of 12 samples collected at equally spaced intervals during the 24-hour period. In instances where the H
2
S concentration of a single sample is not within ±20 percent of the
average of the 12 equally spaced samples, the Administrator may require a more frequent sampling schedule.
(3) The average acid gas flow rate from the sweetening unit: The owner or operator shall install and operate a monitoring device to continuously measure the flow rate of acid gas. The monitoring device reading shall be recorded at least once per hour during each 24-hour period. The average acid gas flow rate shall be computed from the individual readings.
(4) The sulfur feed rate (X): For each 24-hour period, X shall be computed using the equation in § 60.644(b)(3).
(5) The required sulfur dioxide emission reduction efficiency for the 24-hour period: The sulfur feed rate and the H
2
S concentration in the acid gas for the 24-hour period as applicable, shall be used to determine the required reduction efficiency in accordance with the provisions of § 60.642(b).
(b) Where compliance is achieved through the use of an oxidation control system or a reduction control system followed by a continually operated incineration device, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices and continuous emission monitors as follows:
(1) A continuous monitoring system to measure the total sulfur emission rate (E) of SO
2
in the gases discharged to the atmosphere. The SO
2
emission rate shall be expressed in terms of equivalent sulfur mass flow rates (kg/hr (lb/hr)). The span of this monitoring system shall be set so that the equivalent emission limit of § 60.642(b) will be between 30 percent and 70 percent of the measurement range of the instrument system.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section: A monitoring device to measure the temperature of the gas leaving the combustion zone of the incinerator, if compliance with § 60.642(a) is achieved through the use of an oxidation control system or a reduction control system followed by a continually operated incineration device. The monitoring device shall be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within ±1 percent of the temperature being measured.
When performance tests are conducted under the provision of § 60.8 to demonstrate compliance with the standards under § 60.642, the temperature of the gas leaving the incinerator combustion zone shall be determined using the monitoring device. If the volumetric ratio of sulfur dioxide to sulfur dioxide plus total reduced sulfur (expressed as SO
2
) in the gas leaving the incinerator is ≤0.98, then temperature monitoring may be used to demonstrate that sulfur dioxide emission monitoring is sufficient to determine total sulfur emissions. At all times during the operation of the facility, the owner or operator shall maintain the average temperature of the gas leaving the combustion zone of the incinerator at or above the appropriate level determined during the most recent performance test to ensure the sulfur compound oxidation criteria are met. Operation at lower average temperatures may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility. The owner or operator may request that the minimum incinerator temperature be reestablished by conducting new performance tests under § 60.8.
(3) Upon promulgation of a performance specification of continuous monitoring systems for total reduced sulfur compounds at sulfur recovery plants, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous emission monitoring system for total reduced sulfur compounds as required in paragraph (d) of this section in addition to a sulfur dioxide emission monitoring system. The sum of the equivalent sulfur mass emission rates from the two monitoring systems shall be used to compute the total sulfur emission rate (E).
(c) Where compliance is achieved through the use of a reduction control system not followed by a continually operated incineration device, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system to measure the emission rate of reduced sulfur compounds as SO
2
equivalent in the gases discharged to the atmosphere. The SO
2
equivalent compound emission
rate shall be expressed in terms of equivalent sulfur mass flow rates (kg/hr (lb/hr)). The span of this monitoring system shall be set so that the equivalent emission limit of § 60.642(b) will be between 30 and 70 percent of the measurement range of the system. This requirement becomes effective upon promulgation of a performance specification for continuous monitoring systems for total reduced sulfur compounds at sulfur recovery plants.
(d) For those sources required to comply with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the average sulfur emission reduction efficiency achieved (R) shall be calculated for each 24-hour clock internal. The 24-hour interval may begin and end at any selected clock time, but must be consistent. The 24-hour average reduction efficiency (R) shall be computed based on the 24-hour average sulfur production rate (S) and sulfur emission rate (E), using the equation in § 60.644(c)(1).
(1) Data obtained from the sulfur production rate monitoring device specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be used to determine S.
(2) Data obtained from the sulfur emission rate monitoring systems specified in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section shall be used to calculate a 24-hour average for the sulfur emission rate (E). The monitoring system must provide at least one data point in each successive 15-minute interval. At least two data points must be used to calculate each 1-hour average. A minimum of 18 1-hour averages must be used to compute each 24-hour average.
(e) In lieu of complying with (b) or (c) of this section, those sources with a design capacity of less than 152 Mg/D (150 LT/D) of H
2
S expressed as sulfur may calculate the sulfur emission reduction efficiency achieved for each 24-hour period by:

Where:
R = The sulfur dioxide removal efficiency achieved during the 24-hour period, percent.
K
2
= Conversion factor, 0.02400 Mg/D per kg/hr (0.01071 LT/D per lb/hr).
S = The sulfur production rate during the 24-hour period, kg/hr (lb/hr).
X = The sulfur feed rate in the acid gas, Mg/D (LT/D).

Gas Engineers Handbook, Fuel Gas Engineering Practices, The Industrial Press, 93 Worth Street, New York, NY, 1966, First Edition, Second Printing, page 6/25 (Docket A-80-20-A, Entry II-I-67).
(a) When an instantaneous sample is desired and H
2
S concentration is ten grains per 1000 cubic foot or more, a 100 ml Tutwiler burette is used. For concentrations less than ten grains, a 500 ml Tutwiler burette and more dilute solutions are used. In principle, this method consists of titrating hydrogen sulfide in a gas sample directly with a standard solution of iodine.
(b)
Apparatus.
(See Figure 1.) A 100 or 500 ml capacity Tutwiler burette, with two-way glass stopcock at bottom and three-way stopcock at top which connect either with inlet tubulature or glass-stoppered cylinder, 10 ml capacity, graduated in 0.1 ml subdivision; rubber tubing connecting burette with leveling bottle.
(c)
Reagents.
(1) Iodine stock solution, 0.1N. Weight 12.7 g iodine, and 20 to 25 g cp potassium iodide for each liter of solution. Dissolve KI in as little water as necessary; dissolve iodine in concentrated KI solution, make up to proper volume, and store in glass-stoppered brown glass bottle.
(2) Standard iodine solution, 1 ml = 0.001771 g I. Transfer 33.7 ml of above 0.1N stock solution into a 250 ml volumetric flask; add water to mark and mix well. Then, for 100 ml sample of gas, 1 ml of standard iodine solution is equivalent to 100 grains H
2
S per cubic feet of gas.
(3) Starch solution. Rub into a thin paste about one teaspoonful of wheat starch with a little water; pour into about a pint of boiling water; stir; let cool and decant off clear solution. Make fresh solution every few days.
(d)
Procedure.
Fill leveling bulb with starch solution. Raise (L), open cock (G), open (F) to (A), and close (F) when solutions starts to run out of gas inlet. Close (G). Purge gas sampling line and connect with (A). Lower (L) and open (F) and (G). When liquid level is several ml past the 100 ml mark, close (G) and (F), and disconnect sampling tube. Open (G) and bring starch solution to 100 ml mark by raising (L); then close (G). Open (F) momentarily, to bring gas in burette to atmospheric pressure, and close (F). Open (G), bring liquid level down to 10 ml mark by lowering (L). Close (G), clamp rubber tubing near (E) and disconnect it from burette. Rinse graduated cylinder with a standard iodine solution (0.00171 g I per ml); fill cylinder and record reading. Introduce successive small amounts of iodine thru (F); shake well after each addition; continue until a faint permanent blue color is obtained. Record reading; subtract from previous reading, and call difference D.
(e) With every fresh stock of starch solution perform a blank test as follows: introduce fresh starch solution into burette up to 100 ml mark. Close (F) and (G). Lower (L) and open (G). When liquid level reaches the 10 ml mark, close (G). With air in burette, titrate as during a test and up to same end point. Call ml of iodine used C. Then,
Grains H
2
S per 100 cubic foot of gas = 100 (D—C)
(f) Greater sensitivity can be attained if a 500 ml capacity Tutwiler burette is used with a more dilute (0.001N) iodine solution. Concentrations less than 1.0 grains per 100 cubic foot can be determined in this way. Usually, the starch-iodine end point is much less distinct, and a blank determination of end point, with H
2
S-free gas or air, is required.

(g) Each owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to comply with § 60.660(c)(4) or § 60.662(c) shall recalculate the TRE index value for that affected facility whenever process changes are made. Examples of process changes include changes in production capacity, feedstock type, or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. The TRE index value shall be recalculated based on test data, or on best engineering estimates of the effects of the change to the recovery system.
(1) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 1.0, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator within 1 week of the recalculation and shall conduct a performance test according to the methods and procedures required by § 60.664 in order to determine compliance with § 60.662(a). Performance tests must be conducted as soon as possible after the process change but no later than 180 days from the time of the process change.
(2) Where the initial TRE index value is greater than 8.0 and the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 8.0 but greater than 1.0, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test in accordance with §§ 60.8 and 60.664 and shall comply with §§ 60.663, 60.664 and 60.665. Performance tests must be conducted as soon as possible after the process change but no later than 180 days from the time of the process change.
(h) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.660(c)(6) shall use Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D as appropriate, for determination of volumetric flow rate.

Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
(a) Each owner or operator subject to § 60.662 shall notify the Administrator of the specific provisions of § 60.662 (§ 60.662 (a), (b), or (c)) with which the owner or operator has elected to comply. Notification shall be submitted with the notification of initial start-up required by § 60.7(a)(3). If an owner or
operator elects at a later date to use an alternative provision of § 60.662 with which he or she will comply, then the Administrator shall be notified by the owner or operator 90 days before implementing a change and, upon implementing the change, a performance test shall be performed as specified by § 60.664 within 180 days.
(b) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep an up-to-date, readily accessible record of the following data measured during each performance test, and also include the following data in the report of the initial performance test required under § 60.8. Where a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) or greater is used to comply with § 60.662(a), a report containing performance test data need not be submitted, but a report containing the information in § 60.665(b)(2)(i) is required. The same data specified in this section shall be submitted in the reports of all subsequently required performance tests where either the emission control efficiency of a control device, outlet concentration of TOC, or the TRE index value of a vent stream from a recovery system is determined. Beginning on July 15, 2024, owners and operators must submit the performance test report following the procedures specified in paragraph (q) of this section. Data collected using test methods that are supported by the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) as listed on the EPA's ERT website (
https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/electronic-reporting-tool-ert
) at the time of the test must be submitted in a file format generated using the EPA's ERT. Alternatively, the owner or operator may submit an electronic file consistent with the extensible markup language (XML) schema listed on the EPA's ERT website. Data collected using test methods that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT website at the time of the test must be included as an attachment in the ERT or an alternate electronic file.

The Administrator may at any time require a report of these data. Where an owner or operator seeks to comply with § 60.662(c), periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance tests are exceeded are defined as follows:
(1) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in a recovery system, and where an organic compound monitoring device is not used:

(l) Each owner or operator that seeks to comply with the requirements of this subpart by complying with the requirements of § 60.660 (c)(4), (c)(5), or (c)(6) or § 60.662 shall submit to the Administrator semiannual reports of the following recorded information. The initial report shall be submitted within 6 months after the initial start-up date. On and after July 15, 2025 or once the report template for this subpart has been available on the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) website (
https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/cedri
) for 1 year, whichever date is later, owners and operators must submit all subsequent reports using the appropriate electronic report template on the CEDRI website for this subpart and following the procedure specified in paragraph (q) of this section. The date report templates become available will be listed on the CEDRI website. Unless the Administrator or delegated state agency or other authority has approved a different schedule for submission of reports, the report must be submitted by the deadline specified in this subpart, regardless of the method in which the report is submitted.
(1) Exceedances of monitored parameters recorded under § 60.665 (c) and (g).
(2) All periods recorded under § 60.665(d) when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or has no flow rate.

(5) Any change in equipment or process operation that increases the operating vent stream flow rate above the low flow exemption level in § 60.660(c)(6), including a measurement of the new vent stream flow rate, as recorded under § 60.665(i). These must be reported as soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A performance test must be completed with the same time period to verify the recalculated flow value and to obtain the vent stream characteristics of heating value and E
TOC
. The performance test is subject to the requirements of § 60.8, and the performance test must be reported according to paragraph (b) of this section. Unless the facility qualifies for an exemption under the low capacity exemption status in § 60.660(c)(5), the facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in § 60.662.
(6) Any change in equipment or process operation, as recorded under paragraph (j) of this section, that increases the design production capacity above the low capacity exemption level in § 60.660(c)(5) and the new capacity resulting from the change for the distillation process unit containing the affected facility. These must be reported as soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A performance test must be completed within the same time period to obtain the vent stream flow rate, heating value, and E
TOC
. The performance test is subject to the requirements of § 60.8, and the performance test must be reported according to paragraph (b) of this section. The facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in § 60.660(d) or
§ 60.662. If the facility chooses to comply with § 60.662, the facility may qualify for an exemption in § 60.660(c)(4) or (6).
(7) Any recalculation of the TRE index value, as recorded under § 60.665(h).
(m) The requirements of § 60.665(l) remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with § 60.665(l), provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State. The EPA will not approve a waiver of electronic reporting to the EPA in delegating enforcement authority. Thus, electronic reporting to the EPA cannot be waived, and as such, the provisions of this paragraph cannot be used to relieve owners or operators of affected facilities of the requirement to submit the electronic reports required in this section to the EPA.
(n) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.660(c)(5) must submit to the Administrator an initial report detailing the design production capacity of the process unit.
(o) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.660(c)(6) must submit to the Administrator an initial report including a flow rate measurement using the test methods specified in § 60.664.
(p) The Administrator will specify appropriate reporting and recordkeeping requirements where the owner or operator of an affected facility complies with the standards specified under § 60.662 other than as provided under § 60.663(a), (b), (c) and (d).
(q) If an owner or operator is required to submit notifications or reports following the procedure specified in this paragraph (q), the owner or operator must submit notifications or reports to the EPA via CEDRI, which can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
https://cdx.epa.gov/
). The EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to the owner or operator. Do not use CEDRI to submit information the owner or operator claims as CBI. Although the EPA does not expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if an owner or operator wishes to assert a CBI claim for some of the information in the report or notification, the owner or operator must submit a complete file in the format specified in this subpart, including information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA following the procedures in paragraphs (q)(1) and (2) of this section. Clearly mark the part or all of the information that claimed to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed CBI. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c), emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment, and the EPA is required to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available. The owner or operator must submit the same file submitted to the CBI office with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (q).
(1) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the OAQPS CBI Office at the email address
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
, and as described above, should include clear CBI markings. ERT files should be flagged to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group; all other files should be flagged to the attention of the SOCMI NSPS Sector Lead. Owners and operators who do not have their own file sharing service and who require assistance with submitting large electronic files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments should email
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
to request a file transfer link.
(2) If an owner or operator cannot transmit the file electronically, the
owner or operator may send CBI information through the postal service to the following address: OAQPS Document Control Officer (C404-02), OAQPS, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, P.O. Box 12055, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711. ERT files should be sent to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, and all other files should be sent to the attention of the SOCMI NSPS Sector Lead. The mailed CBI material should be double wrapped and clearly marked. Any CBI markings should not show through the outer envelope.
(r) Owners and operators required to electronically submit notifications or reports through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal requirement. To assert a claim of EPA system outage, owners and operators must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (r)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator must have been or will be precluded from accessing CEDRI and submitting a required report within the time prescribed due to an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems.
(2) The outage must have occurred within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date that the submission is due.
(3) The outage may be planned or unplanned.
(4) The owner or operator must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(5) The owner or operator must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying:
(i) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to EPA system outage;
(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which the owner or operator proposes to report, or if the owner or operator has already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date the report was submitted.
(6) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(7) In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved.
(s) Owners and operators required to electronically submit notifications or reports through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX may assert a claim of
force majeure
for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal requirement. To assert a claim of
force majeure,
owners and operators must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (s)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) An owner or operator may submit a claim if a
force majeure
event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the purposes of this section, a
force majeure
event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents the owner or operator from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage).
(2) The owner or operator must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(3) An owner or operator must provide to the Administrator:
(i) A written description of the
force majeure
event;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the
force majeure
event;
(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which the owner or operator proposes to report, or if the owner or operator has already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date the report was submitted.
(4) The decision to accept the claim of
force majeure
and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(5) In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the
force majeure
event occurs.

§ 60.661a
What definitions must I know?
As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act and subpart A of this part.
Batch distillation operation
means a noncontinuous distillation operation in which a discrete quantity or batch of liquid feed is charged into a distillation unit and distilled at one time. After the initial charging of the liquid feed, no additional liquid is added during the distillation operation.
Breakthrough
means the time when the level of TOC, measured at the outlet of the first bed, has been detected is at the highest concentration allowed to be discharged from the adsorber system and indicates that the adsorber bed should be replaced.
Boiler
means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful energy in the form of steam.
By compound
means by individual stream components, not carbon equivalents.
Closed vent system
means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to a control device.
Continuous recorder
means a data recording device recording an instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes.
Distillation operation
means an operation separating one or more feed stream(s) into two or more exit stream(s), each exit stream having component concentrations different from those in the feed stream(s). The separation is achieved by the redistribution of the components between the liquid and vapor-phase as they approach equilibrium within the distillation unit.
Distillation unit
means a device or vessel in which distillation operations occur, including all associated internals (such as trays or packing) and accessories (such as reboiler, condenser, vacuum pump, steam jet, etc.), plus any associated recovery system.
Flame zone
means the portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler or process heater occupied by the flame envelope.
Flow indicator
means a device which indicates whether gas flow is present in a vent stream.
Fuel gas
means gases that are combusted to derive useful work or heat.
Fuel gas system
means the offsite and onsite piping and flow and pressure control system that gathers gaseous stream(s) generated by onsite operations, may blend them with other sources of gas, and transports the gaseous stream for use as fuel gas in combustion devices or in in-process combustion equipment such as furnaces and gas turbines either singly or in combination.
Halogenated vent stream
means any vent stream determined to have a total concentration (by volume) of compounds containing halogens of 20 ppmv (by compound) or greater.
Incinerator
means any enclosed combustion device that is used for destroying organic compounds and does not extract energy in the form of steam or process heat.
Pressure-assisted multi-point flare
means a flare system consisting of multiple flare burners in staged arrays whereby the vent stream pressure is used to promote mixing and smokeless operation at the flare burner tips. Pressure-assisted multi-point flares are designed for smokeless operation at velocities up to Mach = 1 conditions (
i.e.,
sonic conditions), can be elevated or at ground level, and typically use cross-lighting for flame propagation to combust any flare vent gases sent to a particular stage of flare burners.
Primary fuel
means the fuel fired through a burner or a number of similar burners. The primary fuel provides the principal heat input to the device, and the amount of fuel is sufficient to sustain operation without the addition of other fuels.
Process heater
means a device that transfers heat liberated by burning fuel to fluids contained in tubes, including all fluids except water that is heated to produce steam.
Process unit
means equipment assembled and connected by pipes or ducts to produce, as intermediates or final products, one or more of the chemicals in § 60.667a. A process unit can operate independently if supplied with sufficient fuel or raw materials and sufficient product storage facilities.
Product
means any compound or chemical listed in § 60.667a that is produced for sale as a final product as that chemical, or for use in the production of other chemicals or compounds. By-products, co-products, and intermediates are considered to be products.
Recovery device
means an individual unit of equipment, such as an absorber, carbon adsorber, or condenser, capable of and used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for use, reuse, or sale.
Recovery system
means an individual recovery device or series of such devices applied to the same vent stream.
Relief valve
means a valve used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge results from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting
of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.
Total organic compounds
(TOC) means those compounds measured according to the procedures in Method 18 of appendix A-6 of this part or the concentration of organic compounds measured according to the procedures in Method 21 or Method 25A of appendix A-7 of this part.
Vent stream
means any gas stream discharged directly from a distillation facility to the atmosphere or indirectly to the atmosphere after diversion through other process equipment. The vent stream excludes equipment leaks including, but not limited to, pumps, compressors, and valves.
§ 60.662a
What standards and associated requirements must I meet?
(a) You must comply with the emission limits and standards specified in table 1 to this subpart and the requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for each vent stream on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by §§ 60.8 and 60.664a is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after the initial start-up, whichever date comes first. The standards in this section apply at all times, including periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction. As provided in § 60.11(f), this provision supersedes the exemptions for periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction in the general provisions in subpart A of this part.
(b) The following release events from an affected facility are a violation of the emission limits and standards specified in table 1 to this subpart.
(1) Any relief valve discharge to the atmosphere of a vent stream.
(2) The use of a bypass line at any time on a closed vent system to divert emissions to the atmosphere, or to a control device or recovery device not meeting the requirements specified in § 60.663a.
(c) You may designate a vent stream as a maintenance vent if the vent is only used as a result of startup, shutdown, maintenance, or inspection of equipment where equipment is emptied, depressurized, degassed, or placed into service. You must comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section for each maintenance vent. Any vent stream designated as a maintenance vent is only subject to the maintenance vent provisions in this paragraph (c) and the associated recordkeeping and reporting requirements in § 60.665a(g), respectively.
(1) Prior to venting to the atmosphere, remove process liquids from the equipment as much as practical and depressurize the equipment to either: A flare meeting the requirements of § 60.669a, as applicable, or using any combination of a non-flare control device or recovery device meeting the requirements in table 1 to this subpart until one of the following conditions, as applicable, is met.
(i) The vapor in the equipment served by the maintenance vent has a lower explosive limit (LEL) of less than 10 percent.
(ii) If there is no ability to measure the LEL of the vapor in the equipment based on the design of the equipment, the pressure in the equipment served by the maintenance vent is reduced to 5 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) or less. Upon opening the maintenance vent, active purging of the equipment cannot be used until the LEL of the vapors in the maintenance vent (or inside the equipment if the maintenance vent is a hatch or similar type of opening) is less than 10 percent.
(iii) The equipment served by the maintenance vent contains less than 50 pounds of total VOC.
(iv) If, after applying best practices to isolate and purge equipment served by a maintenance vent, none of the applicable criterion in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section can be met prior to installing or removing a blind flange or similar equipment blind, then the pressure in the equipment served by the maintenance vent must be reduced to 2 psig or less before installing or removing the equipment blind. During installation or removal of the equipment blind, active purging of the equipment may be used provided the equipment pressure at the location where purge gas is introduced remains at 2 psig or less.
(2) Except for maintenance vents complying with the alternative in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, you must determine the LEL or, if applicable, equipment pressure using process instrumentation or portable measurement devices and follow procedures for calibration and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications.
(3) For maintenance vents complying with the alternative in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, you must determine mass of VOC in the equipment served by the maintenance vent based on the equipment size and contents after considering any contents drained or purged from the equipment. Equipment size may be determined from equipment design specifications. Equipment contents may be determined using process knowledge.
§ 60.663a
What are my monitoring, installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?
(a) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(5) through (7) of this section, if you use a non-flare control device or recovery system to comply with the TOC emission limit specified in table 1 to this subpart, then you must comply with paragraphs (a)(1) through (4), (b), and (c) of this section.
(1) Install a continuous parameter monitoring system(s) (CPMS) and monitor the operating parameter(s) applicable to the control device or recovery system as specified in table 2 to this subpart or established according to paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) Establish the applicable minimum, maximum, or range for the operating parameter limit as specified in table 3 to this subpart or established according to paragraph (c) of this section by calculating the value(s) as the arithmetic average of operating parameter measurements recorded during the three test runs conducted for the most recent performance test. You may operate outside of the established operating parameter limit(s) during subsequent performance tests in order to establish new operating limits. You must include the updated operating limits with the performance test results submitted to the Administrator pursuant to § 60.665a(b). Upon establishment of a new operating limit, you must thereafter operate under the new operating limit. If the Administrator determines that you did not conduct the performance test in accordance with the applicable requirements or that the operating limit established during the performance test does not correspond to the conditions specified in § 60.664a(a), then you must conduct a new performance test and establish a new operating limit.
(3) Monitor, record, and demonstrate continuous compliance using the minimum frequencies specified in table 3 to this subpart or established according to paragraph (c) of this section.
(4) Comply with the calibration and quality control requirements as specified in table 4 to this subpart or established according to paragraph (c) of this section that are applicable to the CPMS used.
(5) Any vent stream introduced with primary fuel into a boiler or process heater is exempt from the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
(6) If you vent emissions through a closed vent system to an adsorber(s) that cannot be regenerated or a regenerative adsorber(s) that is regenerated offsite, then you must install a system of two or more adsorber units in series and comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section in addition to the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
(i) Conduct an initial performance test or design evaluation of the adsorber and establish the breakthrough limit and adsorber bed life.

(4) For each flare subject to the requirements in § 60.669a, the semiannual report must include an identification of the flare and the items specified in § 60.669a(l)(2).
(5) For each closed vent system subject to the requirements in § 60.670a, the semiannual report must include an identification of the closed vent system and the items specified in § 60.670a(i).
(6) Any change in equipment or process operation, as recorded under paragraph (h) of this section, that increases the design production capacity above the low capacity exemption level in § 60.660a(c)(4) and the new capacity resulting from the change for the distillation process unit containing the affected facility. These must be reported as soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual reports or as a single separate report. Unless the facility qualifies for an exemption under § 60.660a(c), the facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in § 60.662a.
(7) Any change in equipment or process operation that increases the operating vent stream flow rate above the low flow exemption level in § 60.660a(c)(5) or (6), including a measurement of the new vent stream flow rate, as recorded under paragraph (i) of this section. These must be reported as soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A performance test must be completed with the same time period to verify the recalculated flow value. The performance test is subject to the requirements of § 60.8 and must be submitted according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Unless the facility qualifies for an exemption under § 60.660a(c), the facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in § 60.662a.
(8) Exceedances of the emission standard in Table 1 of this subpart as indicated by a 3-hour average of the TOC CEMS and recorded under paragraph (c) of this section. For each exceedance, the report must include a list of the affected facilities or equipment, the start date and time of the exceedance, the duration (in hours) of the exceedance, an estimate of the quantity in pounds of each regulated pollutant emitted over the emission limit, a description of the method used to estimate the emissions, the cause of the exceedance (including unknown cause, if applicable), as applicable, and the corrective action taken.
(9) Periods when the TOC CEMS was inoperative. For each period, the report must include a list of the affected facilities or equipment, the start date and time of the period, the duration (in hours) of the period, the cause of the inoperability (including unknown cause, if applicable), as applicable, and the corrective action taken.
(k) If you are required to submit notifications or reports following the procedure specified in this paragraph (k), you must submit notifications or reports to the EPA via CEDRI, which can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
https://cdx.epa.gov/
). The EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to you. Do not use CEDRI to submit information you claim as CBI. Although we do not expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if you wish to assert a CBI claim for some of the information in the report or notification, you must submit a complete file in the format specified in this subpart, including information
claimed to be CBI, to the EPA following the procedures in paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of this section. Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed CBI. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c), emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment, and the EPA is required to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available. You must submit the same file submitted to the CBI office with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (k).
(1) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the OAQPS CBI Office at the email address
oaqpscbi@epa.gov,
and as described above, should include clear CBI markings. ERT files should be flagged to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group; all other files should be flagged to the attention of the SOCMI NSPS Sector Lead. If assistance is needed with submitting large electronic files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments, and if you do not have your own file sharing service, please email
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
to request a file transfer link.
(2) If you cannot transmit the file electronically, you may send CBI information through the postal service to the following address: OAQPS Document Control Officer (C404-02), OAQPS, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, P.O. Box 12055, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711. ERT files should be sent to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, and all other files should be sent to the attention of the SOCMI NSPS Sector Lead. The mailed CBI material should be double wrapped and clearly marked. Any CBI markings should not show through the outer envelope.
(l) If you are required to electronically submit notifications or reports through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal requirement. To assert a claim of EPA system outage, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (l)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) You must have been or will be precluded from accessing CEDRI and submitting a required report within the time prescribed due to an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems.
(2) The outage must have occurred within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date that the submission is due.
(3) The outage may be planned or unplanned.
(4) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(5) You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying:
(i) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to EPA system outage;
(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.
(6) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(7) In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved.
(m) If you are required to electronically submit notifications or reports through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you
may assert a claim of
force majeure
for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal requirement. To assert a claim of
force majeure,
you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (m)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) You may submit a claim if a
force majeure
event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the purposes of this section, a
force majeure
event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage).
(2) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(3) You must provide to the Administrator:
(i) A written description of the
force majeure
event;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the
force majeure
event;
(iii) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.
(4) The decision to accept the claim of
force majeure
and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(5) In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the
force majeure
event occurs.
(n) The requirements of paragraph (j) of this section remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with paragraph (j) of this section, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State. The EPA will not approve a waiver of electronic reporting to the EPA in delegating enforcement authority. Thus, electronic reporting to the EPA cannot be waived, and as such, the provisions of this paragraph cannot be used to relieve owners or operators of affected facilities of the requirement to submit the electronic reports required in this section to the EPA.
(o) If you seek to demonstrate compliance with § 60.660(c)(4), then you must submit to the Administrator an initial report detailing the design production capacity of the process unit.
(p) If you seek to demonstrate compliance with § 60.660(c)(5) or (6), then you must submit to the Administrator, following the procedures in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an initial report including a flow rate measurement using the test methods specified in § 60.664a.
(q) The Administrator will specify appropriate reporting and recordkeeping requirements where the owner or operator of an affected facility complies with the standards specified under § 60.662a other than as provided under § 60.663a.
(r) Any records required to be maintained by this subpart that are submitted electronically via the EPA's CEDRI may be maintained in electronic format. This ability to maintain electronic copies does not affect the requirement for facilities to make records, data, and reports available upon request to a delegated air agency or the EPA as part of an on-site compliance evaluation.
§ 60.666a

§ 60.668a
[Reserved]
§ 60.669a
What are my requirements if I use a flare to comply with this subpart?
(a) If you use a flare to comply with the TOC emission standard specified in Table 1 to this subpart, then you must meet the applicable requirements for flares as specified in §§ 63.670 and 63.671 of this chapter, including the provisions in tables 12 and 13 to part 63, subpart CC, of this chapter, except as specified in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this section. This requirement also applies to any flare using fuel gas from a fuel gas system, of which 50 percent or more of the fuel gas is derived from an affected facility, as determined on an annual average basis. For purposes of compliance with this paragraph (a), the following terms are defined in § 63.641 of this chapter: Assist air, assist steam, center steam, combustion zone, combustion zone gas, flare, flare purge gas, flare supplemental gas, flare sweep gas, flare vent gas, lower steam, net heating value, perimeter assist air, pilot
gas, premix assist air, total steam, and upper steam.
(b) When determining compliance with the pilot flame requirements specified in § 63.670(b) and (g) of this chapter, substitute “pilot flame or flare flame” for each occurrence of “pilot flame.”
(c) When determining compliance with the flare tip velocity and combustion zone operating limits specified in § 63.670(d) and (e) of this chapter, the requirement effectively applies starting with the 15-minute block that includes a full 15 minutes of the flaring event. You are required to demonstrate compliance with the velocity and NHVcz requirements starting with the block that contains the fifteenth minute of a flaring event. You are not required to demonstrate compliance for the previous 15-minute block in which the event started and contained only a fraction of flow.
(d) Instead of complying with § 63.670(o)(2)(i) of this chapter, you must develop and implement the flare management plan no later than startup for a new flare that commenced construction on or after April 25, 2023.
(e) Instead of complying with § 63.670(o)(2)(iii) of this chapter, if required to develop a flare management plan and submit it to the Administrator, then you must also submit all versions of the plan in portable document format (PDF) following the procedures specified in § 60.665a(k).
(f) Section 63.670(o)(3)(ii) of this chapter and all references to it do not apply. Instead, you must comply with the maximum flare tip velocity operating limit at all times.
(g) Substitute “affected facility” for each occurrence of “petroleum refinery.”
(h) Each occurrence of “refinery” does not apply.
(i) If a pressure-assisted multi-point flare is used as a control device, then you must meet the following conditions:
(1) You are not required to comply with the flare tip velocity requirements in § 63.670(d) and (k) of this chapter;
(2) The NHVcz for pressure-assisted mulit-point flares is 800 Btu/scf;
(3) You must determine the 15-minute block average NHVvg using only the direct calculation method specified in in § 63.670(l)(5)(ii) of this chapter;
(4) Instead of complying with § 63.670(b) and (g) of this chapter, if a pressure-assisted multi-point flare uses cross-lighting on a stage of burners rather than having an individual pilot flame on each burner, then you must operate each stage of the pressure-assisted multi-point flare with a flame present at all times when regulated material is routed to that stage of burners. Each stage of burners that cross-lights in the pressure-assisted multi-point flare must have at least two pilots with at least one continuously lit and capable of igniting all regulated material that is routed to that stage of burners. Each 15-minute block during which there is at least one minute where no pilot flame is present on a stage of burners when regulated material is routed to the flare is a deviation of the standard. Deviations in different 15-minute blocks from the same event are considered separate deviations. The pilot flame(s) on each stage of burners that use cross-lighting must be continuously monitored by a thermocouple or any other equivalent device used to detect the presence of a flame;
(5) Unless you choose to conduct a cross-light performance demonstration as specified in this paragraph (i)(5), you must ensure that if a stage of burners on the flare uses cross-lighting, that the distance between any two burners in series on that stage is no more than 6 feet when measured from the center of one burner to the next burner. A distance greater than 6 feet between any two burners in series may be used provided you conduct a performance demonstration that confirms the pressure-assisted multi-point flare will cross-light a minimum of three burners and the spacing between the burners and location of the pilot flame must be representative of the projected installation. The compliance demonstration must be approved by the permitting authority and a copy of this approval must be maintained onsite. The compliance demonstration report must include: a protocol describing the test
methodology used, associated test method QA/QC parameters, the waste gas composition and NHVcz of the gas tested, the velocity of the waste gas tested, the pressure-assisted multi-point flare burner tip pressure, the time, length, and duration of the test, records of whether a successful cross-light was observed over all of the burners and the length of time it took for the burners to cross-light, records of maintaining a stable flame after a successful cross-light and the duration for which this was observed, records of any smoking events during the cross-light, waste gas temperature, meteorological conditions (
e.g.,
ambient temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity), and whether there were any observed flare flameouts; and
(6) You must install and operate pressure monitor(s) on the main flare header, as well as a valve position indicator monitoring system for each staging valve to ensure that the flare operates within the proper range of conditions as specified by the manufacturer.

What are my requirements for closed vent systems?
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, you must inspect each closed vent system according to the procedures and schedule specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) Conduct an initial inspection according to the procedures in paragraph (b) of this section unless the closed
vent system is operated and maintained under negative pressure;
(2) Conduct annual inspections according to the procedures in paragraph (b) of this section unless the closed vent system is operated and maintained under negative pressure; and
(3) Conduct annual inspections for visible, audible, or olfactory indications of leaks.
(b) You must inspect each closed vent system according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.
(1) Inspections must be conducted in accordance with Method 21 of appendix A of this part.
(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument must meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 must be for the average composition of the process fluid not each individual volatile organic compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, or other inerts which are not organic hazardous air pollutants or volatile organic compounds, the average stream response factor must be calculated on an inert-free basis.
(ii) If no instrument is available at the plant site that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i).
(3) The detection instrument must be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A of this part.
(4) Calibration gases must be as follows:
(i) Zero air (less than 10 parts per million hydrocarbon in air); and
(ii) Mixtures of methane in air at a concentration less than 2,000 parts per million. A calibration gas other than methane in air may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or if the instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or more of the compounds to be measured in air.
(5) You may elect to adjust or not adjust instrument readings for background. If you elect to not adjust readings for background, all such instrument readings must be compared directly to the applicable leak definition to determine whether there is a leak.
(6) If you elect to adjust instrument readings for background, you must determine the background concentration using Method 21 of appendix A of this part. After monitoring each potential leak interface, subtract the background reading from the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument. The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level must be compared with 500 parts per million for determining compliance.
(c) Leaks, as indicated by an instrument reading greater than 500 parts per million above background or by visual, audio, or olfactory inspections, must be repaired as soon as practicable, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(1) A first attempt at repair must be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected.
(2) Repair must be completed no later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected.
(d) Delay of repair of a closed vent system for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown, as defined in § 60.2, or if you determine that emissions resulting from immediate repair would be greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair. Repair of such equipment must be complete by the end of the next shutdown.
(e) For each closed vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away from the control device and to the atmosphere, you must comply with the provisions of either paragraph (e)(1) or (2), except as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that determines whether vent stream flow is present at least once every 15 minutes.
You must keep hourly records of whether the flow indicator was operating and whether a diversion was detected at any time during the hour, as well as records of the times and durations of all periods when the vent stream is diverted to the atmosphere or the flow indicator is not operating. The flow indicator must be installed at the entrance to any bypass line; or
(2) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure the valve is maintained in the closed position and the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line.
(3) Open-ended valves or lines that use a cap, blind flange, plug, or second valve and follow the requirements specified in § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c) or follow requirements codified in another regulation that are the same as § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c) are not subject to this paragraph (e) of this section.
(f) Any parts of the closed vent system that are designated, as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, as unsafe to inspect are exempt from the inspection requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section if:
(1) You determine that the equipment is unsafe to inspect because inspecting personnel would be exposed to an imminent or potential danger as a consequence of complying with paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section; and
(2) You have a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment as frequently as practicable during safe-to-inspect times.
(g) Any parts of the closed vent system are designated, as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, as difficult to inspect are exempt from the inspection requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section if:
(1) You determine that the equipment cannot be inspected without elevating the inspecting personnel more than 2 meters above a support surface; and
(2) You have a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment at least once every 5 years.
(h) You must record the information specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) Identification of all parts of the closed vent system that are designated as unsafe to inspect, an explanation of why the equipment is unsafe to inspect, and the plan for inspecting the equipment.
(2) Identification of all parts of the closed vent system that are designated as difficult to inspect, an explanation of why the equipment is difficult to inspect, and the plan for inspecting the equipment.
(3) For each closed vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away from the control device and to the atmosphere, you must keep a record of the information specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section in addition to the information specified in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section.
(i) Hourly records of whether the flow indicator specified under paragraph (e)(1) of this section was operating and whether a diversion was detected at any time during the hour, as well as records of the times of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or the flow indicator is not operating.
(ii) Where a seal mechanism is used to comply with paragraph (e)(2) of this section, hourly records of flow are not required. In such cases, you must record whether the monthly visual inspection of the seals or closure mechanisms has been done, and you must record the occurrence of all periods when the seal mechanism is broken, the bypass line valve position has changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type configuration has been checked out, and records of any car-seal that has broken.
(iii) For each flow event from a bypass line subject to the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section, you must maintain records sufficient to determine whether or not the detected flow included flow requiring control. For each flow event from a bypass line requiring control that is released either directly to the atmosphere or to a control device not meeting the requirements in this subpart, you must include an estimate of the volume of gas,
the concentration of VOC in the gas and the resulting emissions of VOC that bypassed the control device using process knowledge and engineering estimates.
(4) For each inspection during which a leak is detected, a record of the information specified in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) through (viii) of this section.
(i) The instrument identification numbers; operator name or initials; and identification of the equipment.
(ii) The date the leak was detected and the date of the first attempt to repair the leak.

(2) If an affected facility that routinely uses wet suppression water sprays ceases operation of the water sprays or is using a control mechanism to reduce fugitive emissions other than water sprays during the monthly inspection (for example, water from recent rainfall), the logbook entry required under § 60.676(b) must specify the control mechanism being used instead of the water sprays.
(c) Except as specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, the owner or operator of any affected facility for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced on or after April 22, 2008, that uses a baghouse to control emissions must conduct quarterly 30-minute visible emissions inspections using EPA Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7). The Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7) test shall be conducted while the baghouse is operating. The test is successful if no visible emissions are observed. If any visible emissions are observed, the owner or operator of the affected facility must initiate corrective action within 24 hours to return the baghouse to normal operation. The owner or operator must record each Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7) test, including the date and any corrective actions
taken, in the logbook required under § 60.676(b). The owner or operator of the affected facility may establish a different baghouse-specific success level for the visible emissions test (other than no visible emissions) by conducting a PM performance test according to § 60.675(b) simultaneously with a Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7) to determine what constitutes normal visible emissions from that affected facility's baghouse when it is in compliance with the applicable PM concentration limit in Table 2 of this subpart. The revised visible emissions success level must be incorporated into the permit for the affected facility.
(d) As an alternative to the periodic Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7) visible emissions inspections specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of any affected facility for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced on or after April 22, 2008, that uses a baghouse to control emissions may use a bag leak detection system. The owner or operator must install, operate, and maintain the bag leak detection system according to paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.

e.g.
, using a strip chart recorder or a data logger).
(iii) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will sound when the system detects an increase in relative particulate loading over the alarm set point established according to paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, and the alarm must be located such that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.
(iv) In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, the owner or operator must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm set points, and the alarm delay time.
(v) Following initial adjustment, the owner or operator shall not adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the Administrator or delegated authority except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of this section.
(vi) Once per quarter, the owner or operator may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(vii) The owner or operator must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of the fabric filter.
(viii) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
(2) The owner or operator of the affected facility must develop and submit to the Administrator or delegated authority for approval of a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak detection system. The owner or operator must operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. Each monitoring plan must describe the items in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
(i) Installation of the bag leak detection system;

(v) How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and stored; and
(vi) Corrective action procedures as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. In approving the site-specific monitoring plan, the Administrator or delegated authority may allow owners and operators more than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes an alarm if the owner or operator identifies in the monitoring plan this specific condition as one that could lead to an alarm, adequately explains why it is not feasible to alleviate this condition within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurs, and demonstrates that the requested time will ensure alleviation of this condition as expeditiously as practicable.
(3) For each bag leak detection system, the owner or operator must initiate procedures to determine the cause of every alarm within 1 hour of the alarm. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of this section, the owner or operator must alleviate the cause of the alarm within 3 hours of the alarm by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary.

§ 60.675
Test methods and procedures.
(a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendices A-1 through A-7 of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b). Acceptable alternative methods and procedures are given in paragraph (e) of this section.
(b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the PM standards in § 60.672(a) as follows:
(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (e)(3) and (4) of this section, Method 5 of appendix A-3 of this part or Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part shall be used to determine the particulate matter concentration. The sample volume shall be at least 1.70 dscm (60 dscf). For Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3), if the gas stream being sampled is at ambient temperature, the sampling probe and filter may be operated without heaters. If the gas stream is above ambient temperature, the sampling probe and filter may be operated at a temperature high enough, but no higher than 121 °C (250 °F), to prevent water condensation on the filter.
(2) Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.
(c)(1) In determining compliance with the particulate matter standards in § 60.672(b) or § 60.672(e)(1), the owner or operator shall use Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11, with the following additions:
(i) The minimum distance between the observer and the emission source shall be 4.57 meters (15 feet).
(ii) The observer shall, when possible, select a position that minimizes interference from other fugitive emission sources (
e.g.,
road dust). The required observer position relative to the sun (Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part, Section 2.1) must be followed.
(iii) For affected facilities using wet dust suppression for particulate matter control, a visible mist is sometimes generated by the spray. The water mist must not be confused with particulate matter emissions and is not to be considered a visible emission. When a water mist of this nature is present, the observation of emissions is to be
made at a point in the plume where the mist is no longer visible.
(2)(i) In determining compliance with the opacity of stack emissions from any baghouse that controls emissions only from an individual enclosed storage bin under § 60.672(f) of this subpart, using Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4), the duration of the Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4) observations shall be 1 hour (ten 6-minute averages).
(ii) The duration of the Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4) observations may be reduced to the duration the affected facility operates (but not less than 30 minutes) for baghouses that control storage bins or enclosed truck or railcar loading stations that operate for less than 1 hour at a time.
(3) When determining compliance with the fugitive emissions standard for any affected facility described under § 60.672(b) or § 60.672(e)(1) of this subpart, the duration of the Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4) observations must be 30 minutes (five 6-minute averages). Compliance with the applicable fugitive emission limits in Table 3 of this subpart must be based on the average of the five 6-minute averages.
(d) To demonstrate compliance with the fugitive emission limits for buildings specified in § 60.672(e)(1), the owner or operator must complete the testing specified in paragraph (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Performance tests must be conducted while all affected facilities inside the building are operating.
(1) If the building encloses any affected facility that commences construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after April 22, 2008, the owner or operator of the affected facility must conduct an initial Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4) performance test according to this section and § 60.11.
(2) If the building encloses only affected facilities that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction before April 22, 2008, and the owner or operator has previously conducted an initial Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7) performance test showing zero visible emissions, then the owner or operator has demonstrated compliance with the opacity limit in § 60.672(e)(1). If the owner or operator has not conducted an initial performance test for the building before April 22, 2008, then the owner or operator must conduct an initial Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4) performance test according to this section and § 60.11 to show compliance with the opacity limit in § 60.672(e)(1).
(e) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
(1) For the method and procedure of paragraph (c) of this section, if emissions from two or more facilities continuously interfere so that the opacity of fugitive emissions from an individual affected facility cannot be read, either of the following procedures may be used:
(i) Use for the combined emission stream the highest fugitive opacity standard applicable to any of the individual affected facilities contributing to the emissions stream.
(ii) Separate the emissions so that the opacity of emissions from each affected facility can be read.
(2) A single visible emission observer may conduct visible emission observations for up to three fugitive, stack, or vent emission points within a 15-second interval if the following conditions are met:
(i) No more than three emission points may be read concurrently.
(ii) All three emission points must be within a 70 degree viewing sector or angle in front of the observer such that the proper sun position can be maintained for all three points.
(iii) If an opacity reading for any one of the three emission points equals or exceeds the applicable standard, then the observer must stop taking readings for the other two points and continue reading just that single point.
(3) Method 5I of appendix A-3 of this part may be used to determine the PM concentration as an alternative to the methods specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Method 5I (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3) may be useful for affected facilities that operate for less than 1 hour at a time such as (but not limited to) storage bins or enclosed truck or railcar loading stations.
(4) In some cases, velocities of exhaust gases from building vents may be
too low to measure accurately with the type S pitot tube specified in EPA Method 2 of appendix A-1 of this part [
i.e.,
velocity head
1.3 mm H
2
O (0.05 in. H
2
O)] and referred to in EPA Method 5 of appendix A-3 of this part. For these conditions, the owner or operator may determine the average gas flow rate produced by the power fans (
e.g.,
from vendor-supplied fan curves) to the building vent. The owner or operator may calculate the average gas velocity at the building vent measurement site using Equation 1 of this section and use this average velocity in determining and maintaining isokinetic sampling rates.
ER28AP09.007
Where:
V
e
= average building vent velocity (feet per minute);
Q
f
= average fan flow rate (cubic feet per minute); and
A
e
= area of building vent and measurement location (square feet).
(f) To comply with § 60.676(d), the owner or operator shall record the measurements as required in § 60.676(c) using the monitoring devices in § 60.674 (a)(1) and (2) during each particulate matter run and shall determine the averages.
(g) For performance tests involving only Method 9 (40 CFR part 60 appendix A-4) testing, the owner or operator may reduce the 30-day advance notification of performance test in § 60.7(a)(6) and 60.8(d) to a 7-day advance notification.
(h) [Reserved]
(i) If the initial performance test date for an affected facility falls during a seasonal shut down (as defined in § 60.671 of this subpart) of the affected facility, then with approval from the permitting authority, the owner or operator may postpone the initial performance test until no later than 60 calendar days after resuming operation of the affected facility.

The temperature monitoring devices shall have an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being measured, expressed in °C, or ±0.5 °C (0.9 °F), whichever is greater.
(3) Where a carbon adsorber is used for VOC emissions reduction, a monitoring device that continuously indicates and records the VOC concentration level or reading of organics in the exhaust gases of the control device outlet gas stream or inlet and outlet gas stream shall be used.
(i) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed directly onsite, a monitoring device that continuously indicates and records the volatile organic compound concentration level or reading of organics in the exhaust gases of the control device outlet gas stream or inlet and outlet gas stream shall be used.
(ii) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the carbon bed directly onsite in the control device (e.g., a carbon canister), the concentration level of the organic compounds in the exhaust vent stream from the carbon adsorption system shall be monitored on a regular schedule, and the existing carbon shall be replaced with fresh carbon immediately when carbon breakthrough is indicated. The device shall be monitored on a daily basis or at intervals no greater than 20 percent of the design carbon replacement interval, whichever is greater. As an alternative to conducting this monitoring, an owner or operator may replace the carbon in the carbon adsorption system with fresh carbon at a regular predetermined time interval that is less than the carbon replacement interval that is determined by the maximum design flow rate and organic concentration in the gas stream vented to the carbon adsorption system.

means any noncontinuous reactor process that is not characterized by steady-state conditions and in which reactants are not added and products are not removed simultaneously.
Boiler
means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful energy in the form of steam and is not an incinerator.
By compound
means by individual stream components, not carbon equivalents.
Car-seal
means a seal that is placed on a device that is used to change the position of a valve (e.g., from opened to closed) in such a way that the position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking the seal.
Combustion device
means an individual unit of equipment, such as an incinerator, flare, boiler, or process heater, used for combustion of a vent stream discharged from the process vent.
Continuous recorder
means a data recording device recording an instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes.
Flame zone
means the portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler or process heater occupied by the flame envelope.
Flow indicator
means a device which indicates whether gas flow is present in a line.
Halogenated vent stream
means any vent stream determined to have a total concentration (by volume) of compounds containing halogens of 20 ppmv (by compound) or greater.
Incinerator
means an enclosed combustion device that is used for destroying organic compounds. If there is energy recovery, the energy recovery section and the combustion chambers are not of integral design. That is, the energy recovery section and the combustion section are not physically formed into one manufactured or assembled unit but are joined by ducts or connections carrying flue gas.
Primary fuel
means the fuel fired through a burner or a number of similar burners. The primary fuel provides the principal heat input to the device, and the amount of fuel is sufficient to sustain operation without the addition of other fuels.
Process heater
means a device that transfers heat liberated by burning fuel directly to process streams or to heat transfer liquids other than water.
Process unit
means equipment assembled and connected by pipes or ducts to produce, as intermediates or final products, one or more of the chemicals in § 60.707. A process unit can operate independently if supplied with sufficient feed or raw materials and sufficient product storage facilities.
Product
means any compound or chemical listed in § 60.707 which is produced for sale as a final product as that chemical, or for use in the production of other chemicals or compounds. By-products, co-products, and intermediates are considered to be products.
Reactor processes
are unit operations in which one or more chemicals, or reactants other than air, are combined or decomposed in such a way that their molecular structures are altered and one or more new organic compounds are formed.
Recovery device
means an individual unit of equipment, such as an absorber, carbon adsorber, or condenser, capable of and used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for use, reuse, or sale.
Recovery system
means an individual recovery device or series of such devices applied to the same vent stream.
Relief valve
means a valve used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge results from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.
Secondary fuel
means a fuel fired through a burner other than a primary fuel burner. The secondary fuel may provide supplementary heat in addition to the heat provided by the primary fuel.
Total organic compounds or TOC
means those compounds measured according to the procedures in § 60.704(b)(4). For the purposes of measuring molar composition as required in § 60.704(d)(2)(i) and § 60.704(d)(2)(ii), hourly emission rate as required in § 60.704(d)(5) and § 60.704(e), and TOC concentration as required in § 60.705(b)(4) and § 60.705(f)(4), those compounds which the Administrator has determined do not contribute appreciably to the formation of ozone are to be excluded.
Total resource effectiveness or TRE index value
means a measure of the supplemental total resource requirement per unit reduction of TOC associated with a vent stream from an affected reactor process facility, based on vent stream flow rate, emission rate of TOC, net heating value, and corrosion properties (whether or not the vent stream contains halogenated compounds), as quantified by the equation given under § 60.704(e).
Vent stream
means any gas stream discharged directly from a reactor process to the atmosphere or indirectly to the atmosphere after diversion through other process equipment. The
vent stream excludes relief valve discharges and equipment leaks.

(f) Each owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to comply with § 60.700(c)(2) or § 60.702(c) shall recalculate the TRE index value for that affected facility whenever process changes are made. Examples of process changes include changes in production capacity, feedstock type, or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. The TRE index value shall be recalculated based on test data, or on best engineering estimates of the effects of the change on the recovery system.
(1) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 1.0, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator within 1 week of the recalculation and shall conduct a performance test according to the methods and procedures required by § 60.704 in order to determine compliance with § 60.702 (a) or (b). Performance tests must be conducted as soon as possible after the process change but no later than 180 days from the time of the process change.
(2) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 8.0 but greater than 1.0, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test in accordance with §§ 60.8 and 60.704 and shall comply with §§ 60.703, 60.704 and 60.705. Performance tests must be conducted as soon as possible after the process change but no later than 180 days from the time of the process change.
(g) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.700(c)(4) shall use Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, for determination of volumetric flow rate.
(h) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate that a reactor process vent stream has a TOC concentration for compliance with the low concentration exemption in § 60.700(c)(8) shall conduct an initial test to measure TOC concentration.
(1) The sampling site shall be selected as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
(2) Method 18 of appendix A-6 or Method 25A of appendix A-7 to this part shall be used to measure concentration. ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) may be used in lieu of Method 18 as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(3) Where Method 18 of appendix A-6 to this part, or ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, is used to qualify for the low concentration exclusion in § 60.700(c)(8), the procedures in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (iv) of this section shall be used to measure TOC concentration, and the procedures of paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be used to correct the TOC concentration to 3 percent oxygen. To qualify for the exclusion, the results must demonstrate that the concentration of TOC, corrected to 3 percent oxygen, is below 300 ppm by volume.
(4) Where Method 25A is used, the following procedures shall be used to calculate ppm by volume TOC concentration, corrected to 3 percent oxygen:
(i) Method 25A shall be used only if a single organic compound is greater than 50 percent of total TOC, by volume, in the reactor process vent stream. This compound shall be the principal organic compound.
(ii) The principal organic compound may be determined by either process knowledge or test data collected using an appropriate EPA Reference Method. Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material balances, process stoichiometry, or previous test results provided the results are still relevant to the current reactor process vent stream conditions.
(iii) The principal organic compound shall be used as the calibration gas for Method 25A.
