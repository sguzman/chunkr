# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

For purposes of this part, such term does not include any individual who is an alcoholic or drug abuser and whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents such individual from performing the duties of the job in question, or whose employment, by reason of such current alcohol or drug abuse, would constitute a direct threat to property or to the safety of others.

Physical or mental impairment.
Any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological; musculoskeletal and special sense organs; respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive; digestive; genitourinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine; or any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities.

Policy.
It is DoD policy that under DoD Directive 1350.2
1
the Department of Defense is fully committed to the goal of obtaining equal treatment for all DoD personnel. Specific guidance on off-base housing and fair housing enforcement is as follows:
1
Copies of all DoD issuances listed in this part may be obtained, at cost, from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.
(a)
National Housing Policy.
Federal law prohibits discrimination in housing in the United States against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, handicap, or familial status.
(1) Title VIII of P.L. 90-284 contains the following:
(i) The fair housing provisions.
(ii) Outlines the responsibilities of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with regard to Public Law 90-284.
(iii) Requires all Executive Departments and Agencies to administer housing and urban development programs and activities under their jurisdiction in a manner that shall reflect “affirmatively” the furthering of title VIII.
(2) Title IX of Public Law 90-284 makes it a crime to intimidate willfully or interfere with any person by force or threat because of that person's activities in support of fair housing.
(3) Title 42 U.S.C. 1982 prohibits discrimination in housing in the United States. This statute protects DoD personnel.
(4) Public Law 100-430 amends title VIII of Public Law 90-284 by revising the procedures for the enforcement of fair housing requirements and adding protected classes of individuals.
(5) Title VIII of Public Law 90-284, as amended by Public Law 100-430, does not limit the applicability of any reasonable local, State, or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. Additionally, provisions of such title VIII regarding familial status do not apply with respect to housing intended for, and solely occupied by, persons 62 years of age or older or intended and operated for occupancy, but at least one person 55 years of age or older. For guidance regarding housing occupied by those 55 years of age or older, use the statutory provision at section 805 b(2)(c), 102 Stat. 1623, of Public Law 100-430.
(b)
DoD Fair Housing Policy.
The Department of Defense intends that Federal fair housing law shall be supported and that DoD personnel shall have equal opportunity for available housing regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, handicap, or familial status.
(1) That policy includes the objective of eliminating discrimination against DoD personnel in off-base housing. That objective is not achieved simply by finding a place to live in a particular part of town or in a particular facility for a specific person.
(2) The intent is achieved when a person meeting the ordinary standards of character and financial responsibility is able to obtain off-base housing equally as any other person anywhere in the area surrounding a military installation, without suffering discrimination based on race, color, religion,
sex, age, national origin, handicap or familial status.
(i) The accomplishment of this objective shall not be hampered by requiring the submission of a formal complaint of discrimination. A suspected discriminatory act, with or without the filing of a formal complaint, is a valid basis for investigation and, if discrimination is substantiated, imposition of restrictive sanctions.
(ii) On substantiation that an agent practiced discrimination, restrictive sanctions shall be imposed for a minimum of 180 days.
(iii) The fact that Public Law 90-284, 42 U.S.C. 1982, and Public Law 100-430 may or may not provide a remedy in a given case of discrimination affecting DoD personnel does not relieve a commander of the responsibility to ensure equal treatment and equal opportunity for such personnel or to impose restrictive sanctions against the agent and/or facility, when appropriate.
(iv) Military installations shall develop information programs to apprise Service members of the DoD policy and program for equal opportunity in off-base housing. Commanders should use local community resources, such as civil rights organizations, religious and service groups, and local information media, in support of their programs.

Pt. 192, App. B

# Appendix B to Part 192—Procedures and Reports

# A. Off-Base Housing Procedures
DoD personnel seeking off-base housing shall be processed as follows:
1. Seen by an HRS when available (optional for DoD civilian personnel).
2. Provided assistance in seeking temporary and permanent off-base housing, as follows:
a. Counseling on the equal opportunity in off-base housing program with particular emphasis placed on reporting any indication of discrimination against DoD personnel in their search for housing.
b. Counseling and personal assistance shall include the following services:
(1) Offering to check by telephone the availability of selected listings. A record shall be made and retained for future reference of the date, time, and nature of any conversation confirming the availability of a facility. The race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or familial status of the applicant shall not be divulged. Caution must be exercised to ensure that a pattern of “confirmation only for minorities” does not develop.
(2) Offering the services of a command representative (such as a unit sponsor or other designated person, when available) to accompany and assist the applicant in the search for housing.
(3) Explaining various discriminatory methods that may be employed by agents. For instance, an agent may arbitrarily refuse to accept or consider the applicant as a tenant, falsely indicate the unit sought has been rented to another applicant, or refuse to make the unit available under the same terms and conditions as are ordinarily applied to applicants for the facilities. In such instances the following shall apply:
(a) The agent shall be queried on the reasons why the unit is not available. After all reasonable steps have been taken to ascertain whether any valid nondiscriminatory reason can be shown for the agent's rejection of the applicant, and if there appears to be no such reason, a reasonable effort shall be made to persuade the agent to make the unit available to the applicant.
(b) The incident shall be reported immediately by the command representative and the applicant to the HRS for appropriate command action.

# B. Complaint Procedures—United States
Commanders shall ensure that all DoD personnel are informed of the scope and provisions of the DoD Equal Opportunity in Off-Base Housing Program and advised to report immediately to the HRS (when available) any form of discrimination encountered when seeking housing within a Civilian Community. Incidents should be reported to base agencies or command representatives when an HRS is not available (i.e., equal opportunity officer, unit commander, supervisor). A verbal or written statement of discriminatory policy by an agent is considered to be an act or incident of discrimination, and the investigative procedures outlined in this appendix shall be followed.
1.
Inquiry into Complaint.
Complaints of off-base housing discrimination must receive prompt attention. An inquiry into the complaint shall begin within 3 working days after receipt of the complaint. The inquiry may be informal, but must be detailed sufficiently to determine if discrimination occurred. Upon receipt of a discrimination complaint, the HRS (if there is no HRS, a command designated representative) shall take the following action:
a. Immediately notify the commander.
b. Promptly interview the complainant to determine the details and circumstances of the alleged discriminatory act.
c. Immediately telephone or visit the facility and/or agent concerned, if the complaint is received shortly after the time of the alleged act and it concerns the change in availability of a vacancy (i.e., “just rented,” etc.). Attempt to determine if a vacancy exists without making reference to the complaint received. Request the commander to authorize the use of verifiers, as necessary. (See this appendix, subsection B.2.)
d. Advise the complainant of the provisions and procedures in this Instruction and of the right to pursue further actions through HUD, DoJ, and local or State agencies. Coordinate efforts with the Office of Judge Advocate or other cognizant legal counsel to determine
to what extent legal assistance can be provided to the complainant. Assist the complainant in completing seven signed, dated, and notarized copies of HUD Form 903, “Housing Discrimination Complaint.” The fact that a complainant might report an act of alleged discriminatory treatment, but declines completing a HUD Form 903, does not relieve the command of responsibility for making further inquiry and taking such subsequent actions, as may be appropriate.
e. Document the complainant's action for future reference and inform the commander of the results of the HRS preliminary inquiry and actions taken. The commander shall take action to assist the complainant in obtaining suitable housing. If, due to previous discriminatory practices in the community, suitable housing cannot be obtained by the complainant in a reasonable amount of time, the complainant and the commander may use this fact to justify a request for priority in obtaining military housing or for humanitarian reassignment. Reassignment action is a last resort and must be justified fully through command personnel channels.
2.
Use of Verifiers.
Verifiers are authorized to determine if a vacancy exists and whether or not rental or such practices are discriminatory. Verifiers shall not be used only for determining sincerity or normal practices of an agent about whom the HRS has not received a housing discrimination complaint.
a. When selecting and using verifiers, the following applies:
(1) Verification of the vacancy shall be made expediently after alleged act of discrimination.
(2) Verifiers may be volunteers. (The equal opportunity office is a possible source for identifying individuals to be used as verifiers.)
(3) The purpose of verification is to isolate the attribute of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, or familial status that is the suspected basis for the alleged discrimination against the complainant. Except for those attributes that are considered to be the source of the discrimination complaint, the verifier should possess attributes that are similar to the complainant. If two verifiers are used, one may possess similar attributes to the complainant. Ideally, two verifiers should be used.
b. Instructions provided to the verifiers by HRS personnel should include the following:
(1) Explanation of the equal opportunity in off-base housing and off-base housing referral programs.
(2) Verifiers are to obtain information only on agent and/or facility operating policies, practices, and procedures for subsequent determination of complaint validity.
(3) Verifiers are not to make a verbal or written contract for the housing unit, pay any money, or say they want the housing unit.
(4) Verifiers shall be knowledgeable concerning family composition, pets, and housing requirements of the complainant; they shall ask for identical housing requirements.
(5) The following information shall be obtained by the verifier, if possible:
(a)
Concerning the Facility.
What is available? Does it meet the requirements of the complainant? Amount of rent or cost of facility? Deposit required? Is an application required? What is the time between filing an application and permission to move in? Are there minority families and/or singles in the facility? Make a note of the presence or absence of a vacancy sign, and any other information deemed appropriate.
(b)
Concerning the Prospective Tenants/Purchasers.
If possible, ascertain criteria and qualifications that must be met (credit rating, salary, marital status, deposit, written application, etc.) and obtain a complete description of all procedures for becoming a tenant/purchaser including all steps from initial inquiry to moving in. Does the agent's subjective impression of the applicant appear to play any part in the decision to rent the unit?
(6) The verifier's statement shall be completed immediately after the verification visit, if possible. It shall be accurate, objective, and factual. Include the following in the statement:
(a) Date, time of visit, persons contacted, positions of persons contacted. Include any other pertinent information obtained during visit; i.e., length of time employed at facility, in addition to the information in this appendix, subparagraph B.2.b.(5), above.
(b) When reconstructing a conversation, write in the first person and try to use direct quotes. Do not use pronouns such as “he,” “she,” or “they.” Clearly identify who said what to whom.
(c) Sign and date statement. Give full name, address, telephone number (duty or home), race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap or familial status, as relevant to the complaint.
3.
Complaint Process.
If the basic facts of the HRS preliminary inquiry appear to substantiate the complaint, the commander shall ensure that the following actions begin within 3 working days of receipt of the inquiry report:
a.
Informal Hearing.
Give written notice to the agent explaining the nature of the complaint and the agent's right to request an informal hearing with the commander. The notification shall state specifically the nature of the discrimination complaint and the right of the agent to appear personally at the hearing, to be represented by an attorney, to present evidence, and to call witnesses. The notification also shall state that the agent has 5 days after receipt of the written notice to request a hearing. If no request
is received within 5 days, the lack of response shall be considered as a waiver of the right to such hearing. The written notification either shall be delivered to the agent personally by a representative of the commander, or shall be sent to the agent by certified mail with return receipt requested.
(1)
Composition of an Informal Hearing.
The informal hearing shall be conducted by the commander or designee at a convenient location. The agent, agent's attorney, the complainant, the complainant's attorney, the equal opportunity officer, the HRS, the Staff Judge Advocate or other cognizant legal counsel, or other designated persons may attend.
(2)
Record of Hearing.
A summary of the hearing shall be made a part of the complaint file.
b.
Legal Review.
A legal review shall be accomplished following the inquiry and informal hearing (if applicable) and before the commander's final decision that the inquiry supports or fails to support the complaint. The summary and other pertinent documents shall be reviewed for content and completeness. A statement that such a review was conducted and signed by the Staff Judge Advocate or other cognizant legal counsel performing the review shall be made a part of the case file. That statement shall include:
(1) Any necessary explanatory remarks, including comments on the facts and evidence presented.
(2) Information known about pending complaints brought by other parties on the same facility and/or agent.
(3) Comments on the civil rights laws relevant to the particular case.
4.
Commander's Decision.
The responsibility for imposition of restrictive sanctions rests with the commander and cannot be delegated. The commander's decision shall be based on a full and impartial review of all facts and the policies and requirements as stated in this part. The commander's options include the following:
a. If the commander determines that more information is required, or for any reason further inquiry is deemed necessary, an officer shall be appointed from sources other than the HRS to conduct a formal inquiry or investigation, as the situation warrants. The officer, if not an attorney, shall be afforded the advice and assistance of a Staff Judge Advocate or other cognizant legal counsel.
b. If, in the commander's judgment, the inquiry or investigation fails to support the complaint the case shall be considered closed and the commander shall:
(1) Inform the complainant in writing of all actions taken and advise the complainant of rights to pursue further actions to include the following:
(a) The right to submit a complaint to the HUD and the DoJ.
(b) The right to bring a private civil action in a State or Federal court of competent jurisdiction.
(c) The availability of legal assistance from their local Staff Judge Advocate or other cognizant legal counsel in pursuing civil redress.
(2) Summarize in the report file the practices giving rise to the complaint, the actions and results of the inquiry or investigation, and if discriminatory practices were found, written assurances from the agent on future facility and/or agent practices. The following statement, completed by the complainant, shall be included, as part of the case file: “I am (am not) satisfied with the efforts taken by the commander on my behalf to achieve satisfactory resolution of my off-base housing discrimination complaint.” If the complainant indicates a lack of satisfaction, the reasons must be included in the case file.
(3) Inform the agent of the results of the inquiry by command correspondence if an informal hearing was held. Such correspondence should reiterate DoD policy and requirements for equal opportunity in off-base housing.
(4) Forward unsubstantiated complaint reports and HUD Form 903 to the HUD and the DoJ if requested by the complainant.
(5) Retain a copy of the report file for 2 years for future reference.
c. If the inquiry or investigation supports the complainant's charge of discrimination and the discriminatory act is determined by the commander to conflict with DoD policy, the commander shall:
(1) Impose restrictive sanctions against the agent and/or facility for a minimum of 180 days. Sanctions shall remain in effect until the requirements in this appendix, subparagraphs B.6.a.(1) or B.6.a.(2), below, are met. Restrictive sanctions shall be imposed when a suspected discriminatory act, despite the absence of a formal complaint, is investigated and found valid. The fact that a validated discrimination complaint and/or incident has been or is scheduled to be forwarded to another Agency (the HUD, the DoJ, etc.) is not cause for withholding sanction action pending the outcome of that Agency's further review or investigation. When imposing a restrictive sanction, the commander shall:
(a) Remove the facility listing(s) from HRO files.
(b) Impose restrictive sanctions against all facilities owned or operated by the agent concerned.
(c) Place the facility on the restrictive sanction list maintained by the HRS. The restrictive sanction list shall be prepared on official letterhead stationery, signed by the commander, and include the authority for and conditions of the restrictive sanctions.
(d) Inform the agent concerned by command correspondence that:
(1) Restrictive sanctions have been imposed.
(2) The reasons, nature, and minimum duration of the restrictions.
(3) The action required for the removal of sanctions at the conclusion of the minimum period.
The notification of restrictive sanctions shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested or delivered to the agent personally by a command representative.
(e) Provide all DoD personnel reporting to the HRS with a copy of the restrictive sanction list, and advise members of the Armed Forces that they may not rent, lease, purchase, or reside in any of the listed facilities. Obtain a signed acknowledgment of receipt of the restrictive sanction list from the HRS using a DD Form 1746, “Application for Assignment to Housing.”
(f) Advise other military installations of the restrictive sanction action taken when the sanctioned facility is located within the commuting area of their military installations.
(2) Inform the complainant in writing of all actions taken and advise the complainant that his or her case will receive continuing action to include, if the complainant requests, forwarding the case file to the HUD and/or the DoJ for action.
(3) Before forwarding the report to the respective Military Department, prepare a memorandum outlining the following:
(a) The base efforts made to obtain housing relief for the complainant.
(b) The impact of restrictive sanctions on the off-base housing program and DoD personnel and their dependents.
(c) Any other considerations deemed relevant.
(4) Include a statement completed by the complainant for the case file. (See this appendix, subparagraph B.4.b.(3), above.)
(5) If the act of discrimination falls within existing regulations, forward a copy of the complaint and investigation report directly to the HUD within 180 days after the occurrence of the alleged discriminating act, using HUD Form 903. The original report shall be sent to the appropriate HUD Regional Office or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, 451 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. A copy of the complaint and investigation report shall be forwarded to the Civil Rights Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530.
(6) When more than one complaint alleging discrimination in the same facility or by the same agent has been received, consolidate the complaints for the inquiry, legal review, and commander's memorandum.
d. When a commander receives a complaint alleging further discrimination in a facility or by an agent after a completed case file has been closed, the commander shall forward the summary of the facts on the subsequent complaint, outlined in this enclosure, subparagraph B.4.c.(6), above. Include brief comments indicating the extent to which the new complaint affects the previous action.
5.
Followup Actions.
After forwarding the report and all required attachments to the HUD and the DoJ, the commander shall take the following actions:
a. Cooperate with the HUD, the DoJ, and the local and State agency representatives during their investigation and processing of the case, should those entities seek assistance.
b. Periodically determine the status of the case by maintaining liaison with the HUD office concerned. Contact shall be maintained until such time as the case is resolved by the HUD.
c. Ensure that the complainant is kept informed directly by the HUD and/or the DoJ.
d. Ensure that DoD personnel comply with the restrictive sanctions imposed on the facility and/or the agent. Housing personnel will comply with the following:
(1) Military personnel moving into or changing their place of residence in the commuting area of a military installation or activity may not enter into a rental, purchase, or lease arrangement with an agent or a facility that is under restrictive sanction.
(2) Implement procedures for ensuring that DoD personnel seeking housing are made aware of, and are counselled on, current restrictive sanctions.
(3) Sanctions are not applicable to the DoD personnel who may be residing in a facility when the sanction is imposed or to the extension or renewal of a rental or lease agreement originally entered into before the imposition of the sanction. Relocation of a military tenant within a restricted facility is prohibited without the written approval of the commander.
(4) If it is determined that a member of the Armed Forces has intentionally taken residency in a restricted facility contrary to instructions received by Housing Referral personnel, the commander shall take appropriate disciplinary action against that number.
(5) Periodically publish a current listing of restricted facilities in the base bulletin (or other appropriate means of internal distribution). Minimally, such publication shall occur when there has been an addition or deletion to the list.
6.
Removal of Restrictive Sanction
a. A facility and/or agent may be removed from restrictive sanction only if one of the following actions is taken:
(1) The restrictive sanction may be removed before completion of the 180 day restrictive period if an approved waiver request is obtained from the senior installation commander concerned, or designee. Consideration shall be given to lifting an imposed sanction only in exceptional circumstances and in conjunction with a written assurance of nondiscrimination from the agent concerned.
(2) After completion of 180 days on restrictive sanction, if the agent provides written assurance of future nondiscrimination to the HRS.
b. The commander shall inform the HRS, the equal opportunity office, and the agent in writing of the removal from restrictive sanction.
7.
“Privacy Act” and “Freedom of Information Act” Inquiries.
Requests for information from reports of housing discrimination shall be processed in accordance with 32 CFR parts 285 and 286a.

# C. Compliant Procedures—Outside the United States
Commanders of installations or activities outside the United States shall ensure that all DoD personnel, on reporting to the HRS, are clearly informed of the scope and provisions of the DoD Equal Opportunity in Off-Base Housing Program and advised to report immediately to the HRS any form of discrimination encountered as a tenant, prospective tenant, or purchaser. Incidents reported to base agencies or representatives other than the HRS (i.e., equal opportunity officer, unit commander, supervisor) shall be brought to the immediate attention of the HRS for appropriate action. On receiving a complaint of discrimination, the commander and HRS shall:
1. Consult with the Staff Judge Advocate or other cognizant legal counsel to determine if the laws of the country concerned (or any subdivision thereof) prohibit any of the actions outlined in this appendix, section B., above.
2. Take actions outlined in this appendix, section B, above, except that a HUD Form 903 shall not be completed because reports of cases arising outside the United States are not forwarded to the HUD or the DoJ. Complainants should understand that the fair housing provisions of the P.L. 90-284, “Civil Rights Act,” Title 42, United States, 1982, and Public Law 100-430, “Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988,” September 13, 1988, are not applicable in areas outside the United States.
3. Determine, with legal advice, whether redress for the discriminatory act should be sought from authorities in the host country. Redress shall be based on the laws of the country (or subdivision thereof) concerned.

# D. Reporting Requirements
1. A copy of each complaint and investigative report that substantiates a housing discrimination shall be submitted to the appropriate Military Department (manpower and reserve affairs and/or the equal opportunity office) not later than 45 days from the date the case is completed. Under normal circumstances, the commander of the installation concerned shall complete the required investigation and processing complaints within 45 days from the date that a housing complaint is filed by a complainant.
2. A copy of complaint and investigative reports that do not substantiate allegations of housing discrimination shall be kept on file at the installation level for a 24-month period beginning from the date the case was completed.

§ 195.4
Policy.
(a)
General.
No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program to which this (part) applies.
(b)
Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.
(1) A recipient under any program to which this part applies may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or national origin:
(i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;
(ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;
(iii) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient may not make selections with the purpose of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this part applies, on the ground of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this part.
(iv) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;
(v) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;
(vi) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or
other benefit provided under the program;
(vii) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program;
(viii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.
(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.
(3) As used in this section the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.
(4)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.
(ii) Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin.
(5) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but nevertheless discrimination on the grounds of race, color or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this Directive tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin of the intended beneficiaries, to exclude intended beneficiaries from participation in, to deny them benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this Directive applies, the recipient or other persons subject to this Directive are prohibited from (directly or through contractual or other arrangements) subjecting an individual to discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising; employment, layoff or termination; upgrading, demotion or transfer; rates of pay and/or other forms of compensation; and use of facilities), to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of the beneficiaries. Any action taken by a component pursuant to this provision with respect to a state or local agency subject to Standards for a Merit System of Personnel Administration, 45 CFR part 70, shall be consistent with those standards and shall be coordinated with the U.S. Civil Service Commission.
(6) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.

§ 195.6
Assurances required.
(a)
General.
(1)(i) Every application for Federal financial assistance to carry out a program to which this part applies, except a program to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part.
(ii) In the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services and benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application. In any case in which Federal financial assistance is extended without an application having been made, such extension shall be subject to the same assurances as if an application had been made. The responsible Department official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances for each program, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subguarantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants in the program. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.
(2) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interest therein, which was acquired through a program of Federal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer, shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved under a program of Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible Department official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the program under which the real property
is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In the event a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the responsible Department official may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective. In programs receiving Federal financial assistance in the form, or for the acquisition of real property or an interest in real property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under any such property are included as part of the program receiving such assistance, the nondiscrimination requirements of this part shall extend to any facility located wholly or in part in such space.
(3) The assurance required in the case of a transfer of surplus personal property shall be inserted in a written agreement by and between the Department of Defense component concerned and the recipient.
(b)
Continuing State programs.
Every application by a State agency to carry out a program involving continuing Federal financial assistance to which this part applies shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application (1) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part, and (2) provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the program as are found by the responsible Department official to give reasonable assurance that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. In cases of continuing State programs in which applications are not made, the extension of Federal financial assistance shall be subject to the same conditions under this subsection as if applications had been made.
(c)
Assurances from institutions.
(1) In the case of Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education, the assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.
(2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as students of the institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution unless the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the responsible Department official, that the institution's practices in designated parts or programs of the institution will in no way affect its practices in the program of the institution for which Federal financial assistance is sought, or the beneficiaries of or participants in such program. If in any such case the assistance sought is for the construction of a facility or part of a facility, the assurance shall in any event extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith.
(d)
Elementary and secondary schools.
The requirement of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, with respect to any elementary or secondary school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part, and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan; in any case of continuing Federal financial assistance the said Department officer may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may
be specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purpose of the Act or this part within the earliest practicable time. In any case in which a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future modification of said order.
[29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964, as amended at 38 FR 17960, July 5, 1973]
§ 195.7
Compliance information.
(a)
Cooperation and assistance.
Each responsible Department official shall to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part.
(b)
Compliance reports.
Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to the responsible Department official timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as the responsible Department official may determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In general, recipients should have available for the Department racial and ethnic data showing the extent to which members of minority groups are beneficiaries of federally assisted programs. In the case of any program under which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations imposed pursuant to this part.
(c)
Access to sources of information.
Each recipient shall permit access by the responsible Department official during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other institution or person and this institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.
(d)
Information to beneficiaries and participants.
Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program under which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the responsible Department official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.
[29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964, as amended at 38 FR 17960, July 5, 1973]
§ 195.8
Conduct of investigations.
(a)
Periodic compliance reviews.
The responsible Department official or his designee(s) shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part.
(b)
Complaints.
Any person who believes himself or any specific class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may by himself or by a representative file with the responsible Department official a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the responsible Department official.
(c)
Investigations.
The responsible Department official will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination of whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part.
(d)
Resolution of matters.
(1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this part, the responsible Department official will so inform the
recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided in § 195.9.
(2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the responsible Department official will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.
(e)
Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.
No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this part, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall not be disclosed except when necessary to carry out the purposes of this part including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.
[29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964, as amended at 38 FR 17960, July 5, 1974. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 32965, July 18, 1991]
§ 195.9
Procedure for effecting compliance.
(a)
General.
If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law as determined by the responsible Department official. Such other means may include, but are not limited to (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceedings under State or local law.
(b)
Noncompliance with § 195.6.
If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 195.6 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The component of the Department of Defense concerned shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that the component shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part.
(c)
Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section no order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible Department official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding, after opportunity for a hearing (as provided in § 195.10), of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3) the action has been approved by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to § 195.11, and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the Secretary of Defense has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.
(d)
Other means authorized by law.
No action to affect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the responsible Department official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the action has been approved
by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower), (3) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (4) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.
[29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 32965, July 18, 1991]
§ 195.10
Hearings.
(a)
Opportunity for hearing.
Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 195.9, reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible Department official that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 195.11(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.
(b)
Time and place of hearing.
Hearings shall be held at the offices of the responsible component of the Department of Defense in Washington, D.C., at a time fixed by the responsible Department official unless he determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the component requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the responsible Department official or, at his discretion, before a hearing examiner designated by him.
(c)
Hearing examiner.
The examiner shall be a field grade officer or civilian employee above the grade of GS-12 (or the equivalent) who shall be a person admitted to practice law before a Federal court or the highest court of a State.
(d)
Right to counsel.
In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and the responsible component of the Department shall have the right to be represented by counsel.
(e)
Procedures.
(1) The recipient shall receive an open hearing at which he or his counsel may examine any witnesses present. Both the responsible Department official and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.
(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.
(f)
Consolidated or joint hearings.
In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more programs to which this part applies, or noncompliance with
this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title VI of the Act, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower), the Secretary of a Military Department, or other responsible Department official designated by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower) after consultation with the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower) may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of appropriate procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 195.11.
[29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964, as amended at 30 FR 133, Jan. 7, 1965. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 32965, July 18, 1991]
§ 195.11
Decisions and notices.
(a)
Decision by person other than the responsible department official.
If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner such hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the responsible Department official for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient. Where the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner the applicant or recipient may within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the responsible Department official his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible Department official may on his own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review the responsible Department official shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the responsible Department official.
(b)
Decisions on record or review by the responsible department official.
Whenever a record is certified to the responsible Department official for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or whenever the responsible Department official conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the responsible Department official shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.
(c)
Decisions on record where a hearing is waived.
Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 195.10(a), a decision shall be made by the responsible Department official on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.
(d)
Rulings required.
Each decision of a hearing officer or responsible Department official shall set forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
(e)
Approval by the Secretary of Defense.
Any final decision of a responsible Department official which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Secretary of Defense, who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.
(f)
Contents of orders.
The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, under the program involved, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance will thereafter be extended under such program to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in
default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Department official that it will fully comply with this part.
(g)
Post-termination proceedings.
(1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this part.
(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible Department official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible Department official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.
(3) If the responsible Department official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Department official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this subsection are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.
[29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964, as amended at 38 FR 17960, July 5, 1973. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 32965, July 18, 1991]
§ 195.12
Judicial review.
Action taken pursuant to section 602 of the Act is subject to judicial review as provided in section 603 of the Act.
§ 195.13
Effect on other issuances.
All issuances heretofore issued by any officer of the Department of Defense or its components which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program to which this part applies, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance under such program for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of this part. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):
(a) Executive Orders 10925 and 11114 and issuances thereunder,

An assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in accordance with § 196.110(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination whether occurring prior to or subsequent to the submission to the designated agency official of such assurance.

(2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest.
§ 196.120
Transfers of property.
If a recipient sells or otherwise transfers property financed in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance to a transferee that operates any education program or activity, and the Federal share of the fair market value of the property is not upon such sale or transfer properly accounted for to the Federal Government, both the transferor and the transferee shall be deemed to be recipients, subject to the provisions of §§ 196.205 through 196.235(a).
§ 196.125
Effect of other requirements.

(c)
Effect of rules or regulations of private organizations.
The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association that would render any applicant or student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and that receives Federal financial assistance.
§ 196.130

(5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began.
§ 196.450
Athletics.
(a)
General.
No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.

However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.
(c)
Equal opportunity.
(1) A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated agency official will consider, among other factors:

(d)
Adjustment period.
A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000.

is essential to successful operation of the employment function concerned. A recipient shall not take action pursuant to this section that is based upon alleged comparative employment characteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon preference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students, or other persons, but nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient from considering an employee's sex in relation to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used only by members of one sex.

(C) Develop for issuance, subject to approval by the ASD(HA), such policies or regulations as required to administer and manage CHAMPUS effectively.
(v)
Evidence of eligibility.
The Department of Defense, through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), is responsible for establishing and maintaining a listing of persons eligible to receive benefits under CHAMPUS. Identification cards or devices bearing information necessary for preliminary evidence of eligibility, subject to verification through the DEERS, shall be issued to eligible persons by the appropriate Uniformed Services (DoD 1341.1-M, “Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) Program Manual”).
(d)
Medical benefits program.
The CHAMPUS is a program of medical benefits provided by the U.S. Government under public law to specified categories of individuals who are qualified for these benefits by virtue of their relationship to one of the seven Uniformed Services. Although similar in structure in many of its aspects, CHAMPUS is not an insurance program in that it does not involve a contract guaranteeing the indemnification of an insured party against a specified loss in return for a premium paid. Further, CHAMPUS is not subject to those state regulatory bodies or agencies that control the insurance business generally.
(e)
Program funds.
The funds used by CHAMPUS are appropriated funds furnished by the Congress through the annual appropriation acts for the Department of Defense and the DHHS. These funds are further disbursed by agents of the government under contracts negotiated by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, under the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). These agents (referred to in this part as CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries) receive claims against CHAMPUS and adjudicate the claims under this part and in accordance with administrative procedures and instructions prescribed in their contracts. The funds expended for CHAMPUS benefits are federal funds provided CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries solely to pay CHAMPUS claims, and are not a part of or obtained from the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary's funds related to other programs or insurance coverage. CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries are reimbursed for the adjudication and payment of CHAMPUS claims at a rate (generally fixed-price) prescribed in their contracts.
(f)
Claims adjudication and processing.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, is responsible for making such arrangements as are necessary to adjudicate and process CHAMPUS claims worldwide.
(1)
The United States
—(i)
Contracting out.
The primary method of processing CHAMPUS claims in the United States is through competitively procured, fixed-price contracts. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is responsible for negotiating, under the provisions of the FAR, contracts for the purpose of adjudicating and processing CHAMPUS claims (and related supporting activities).
(ii)
In-house.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is authorized to adjudicate and process certain CHAMPUS claims in-house at OCHAMPUS, when it is determined to be in the best interests of CHAMPUS subject to applicable considerations set forth in OMB Circular A-76. Such in-house claims processing may involve
special or unique claims, or all claims for a specific geographic area.
(2)
Outside the United States
—(i)
Special subsidiary office or contracting out.
For adjudicating and processing CHAMPUS claims for services or supplies provided outside the United States, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, has the option of either setting up a special subsidiary claims paying operation (such as OCHAMPUSEUR) or contracting out as described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. Such claims paying operations are reviewed periodically to determine whether current arrangements continue to be appropriate and the most effective.
(ii)
Support agreements.
In those situations outside the United States that demand special arrangements, the Director, OCHAMPUS, may enter into support agreements through the Department of Defense with any of the Military Departments or other government agency to process CHAMPUS claims in specific geographic locations. Such agreements may be negotiated for such period of time as the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may determine to be necessary to meet identified special demands.
(g)
Recommendations for change to part.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall establish procedures for receiving and processing recommendations for changes to this part from interested parties.
(h)
CHAMPUS, claims forms.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is responsible for the development and updating of all CHAMPUS claim forms and any other forms necessary in the administration of CHAMPUS.
(i)
The CHAMPUS handbook.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall develop the CHAMPUS, Handbook. The CHAMPUS Handbook is a general program guide for the use of CHAMPUS beneficiaries and providers and shall be updated, as required.
(j)
Program integrity.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall oversee all CHAMPUS personnel, fiscal intermediaries, providers, and beneficiaries to ensure compliance with this part. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall accomplish this by means of proper delegation of authority, separation of responsibilities, establishment of reports, performance evaluations, internal and external management and fiscal audits, personal or delegated reviews of CHAMPUS responsibilities, taking affidavits, exchange of information among state and Federal governmental agencies, insurers, providers and associations of providers, and such other means as may be appropriate. Compliance with law and this part shall include compliance with specific contracts and agreements, regardless of form, and general instructions, such as CHAMPUS policies, instructions, procedures, and criteria relating to CHAMPUS operation.
(k)
Role of CHAMPUS Health Benefits Advisor (HBA).
The CHAMPUS HBA is appointed (generally by the commander of a Uniformed Services medical treatment facility) to serve as an advisor to patients and staff in matters involving CHAMPUS. The CHAMPUS HBA may assist beneficiaries or sponsors in applying for CHAMPUS benefits, in the preparation of claims, and in their relations with OCHAMPUS and CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries. However, the CHAMPUS HBA is not responsible for CHAMPUS policies and procedures and has no authority to make benefit determinations or obligate Government funds. Advice given to beneficiaries as to determination of benefits or level of payment is not binding on OCHAMPUS or CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries.
(l)
Cooperation and exchange of information with other Federal programs.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall disclose to appropriate officers or employees of the DHHS:
(1)
Investigation for fraud.
The name and address of any physician or other individual actively being investigated for possible fraud in connection with CHAMPUS, and the nature of such suspected fraud. An active investigation exists when there is significant evidence supporting an initial complaint but there is need for further investigation.
(2)
Unnecessary services.
The name and address of any provider of medical services, organization, or other person found, after consultation with an appropriate professional association or appropriate peer review body, to have
provided unnecessary services. Such information will be released only for the purpose of conducting an investigation or prosecution, or for the administration of titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act, provided that the information will be released only to the agency's enforcement branch and that the agency will preserve the confidentiality of the information received and will not disclose such information for other than program purposes.
(m)
Disclosure of information to the public.
Records and information acquired in the administration of CHAMPUS are records of the Department of Defense and may be disclosed in accordance with DoD Directive 5400.7

(n)
Discretionary authority.
When it is determined to be in the best interest of CHAMPUS, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is granted discretionary authority to waive any requirements of this part, except that any requirement specifically set forth in 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, or otherwise imposed by law, may not be waived. It is the intent that such discretionary authority be used only under very unusual and limited circumstances and not to deny any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided to him or her by statute or this part. Any such exception granted by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall apply only to the individual circumstance or case involved and will in no way be construed to be precedent-setting.
(o)
Demonstration projects
—(1)
Authority.
The Director, OCHAMPUS may waive or alter any requirements of this regulation in connection with the conduct of a demonstration project required or authorized by law except for any requirement that may not be waived or altered pursuant to 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, or other applicable law.
(2)
Procedures.
At least 30 days prior to taking effect, OCHAMPUS shall publish a notice describing the demonstration project, the requirements of this regulation being waived or altered under paragraph (o)(1) of this section and the duration of the waiver or alteration. Consistent with the purpose and nature of demonstration projects, these notices are not covered by public comment practices under DoD Directive 5400.9 (32 CFR part 296) or DoD Instruction 6010.8.
(3)
Definition.
For purposes of this section, a “demonstration project” is a project of limited duration designed to test a different method for the finance, delivery or administration of health care activities for the uniformed services. Demonstration projects may be required or authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1092, any other statutory provision requiring or authorizing a demonstration project or any other provision of law that authorizes the activity involved in the demonstration project.”.
(p)
Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program.
The Secretary of Defense, or designee, may enter into an agreement (external or internal) providing for the sharing of resources between facilities of the uniformed services and facilities of a civilian health care provider or providers if the Secretary determines that such an agreement would result in the delivery of health care in a more effective, efficient or economical manner. This partnership allows CHAMPUS beneficiaries to receive inpatient and outpatient services through CHAMPUS from civilian personnel providing health care services in military treatment facilities and from uniformed service professional providers in civilian facilities. The policies and procedures by which partnership agreements may be executed are set forth in Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6010.12, “Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program.” The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue policies, instructions, procedures, guidelines, standards, or criteria as may be necessary to provide support for implementation of DoDI 6010.12, to promulgate and manage benefit and financial policy issues, and to develop a program evaluation process to ensure the Partnership Program accomplishes the purpose for which it was developed.
(1)
Partnership agreements.
Military treatment facility commanders, based upon the authority provided by their representative Surgeons General of the military departments, are responsible for entering into individual partnership agreements only when they have determined specifically that use of the Partnership Program is more economical overall to the Government than referring the need for health care services to the civilian community under the normal operation of the CHAMPUS Program. All such agreements are subject to the review and approval of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, and the appropriate Surgeon General.
(i)
External partnership agreements.
The external partnership agreement is an agreement between a military treatment facility Commander and a CHAMPUS-authorized institutional provider, enabling Uniformed Services health care personnel to provide otherwise covered medical care to CHAMPUS beneficiaries in a civilian facility. Authorized costs associated with the use of the facility will be financed through CHAMPUS under normal cost-sharing and reimbursement procedures currently applicable under the basic CHAMPUS. Savings will be realized under this type of agreement by using available military health care personnel to avoid the civilian professional provider charges which would otherwise be billed to CHAMPUS.
(ii)
Internal partnership agreements.
The internal partnership agreement is an agreement between a military treatment facility commander and a CHAMPUS-authorized civilian health care provider which enables the use of civilian health care personnel or other resources to provide medical care to CHAMPUS beneficiaries on the premises of a military treatment facility. These internal agreements may be established when a military treatment facility is unable to provide sufficient health care services for CHAMPUS beneficiaries due to shortages of personnel and other required resources. In addition to allowing the military treatment facility to achieve maximum use of available facility space, the internal agreement will result in savings to the Government by using civilian medical specialists to provide inpatient care in Government-owned facilities, thereby avoiding the civilian facility charges which would have otherwise been billed to CHAMPUS.
(2)
Beneficiary cost-sharing.
Beneficiary cost-sharing under the Partnership Program is outlined in § 199.4(f)(5) of this part.
(3)
Reimbursement.
Reimbursement under the Partnership Program is outlined in § 199.14(f) of this part.
(4)
Beneficiary eligibility and authorized providers.
Existing requirements of this Regulation remain in effect as concerns beneficiary eligibility and authorized providers.
(5)
Range of benefits.
Health care services provided CHAMPUS beneficiaries under the terms of the Partnership Program must be consistent with the CHAMPUS range of benefits outlined in this Regulation. The services rendered must be otherwise covered. Charges allowed for professional services provided under the Partnership Program may include costs of support personnel, equipment, and supplies when specifically outlined in the partnership agreement, However, all CHAMPUS coverage and provider requirements must be met.
(q)
Equality of benefits.
All claims submitted for benefits under CHAMPUS shall be adjudicated in a consistent, fair, and equitable manner, without regard to the rank of the sponsor.
(r)
TRICARE program.
Many rules and procedures established in sections of this part are subject to revision in areas where the TRICARE program is implemented. The TRICARE program is the means by which managed care activities designed to improve the delivery and financing of health care services in the Military Health Services System(MHSS) are carried out. Rules and procedures for the TRICARE program are set forth in § 199.17.
[51 FR 24008, July 1, 1986, as amended at 52 FR 38754, Oct. 19, 1987; 53 FR 27961, July 26, 1988; 55 FR 43338, Oct. 29, 1990; 60 FR 52094, Oct. 5, 1995]
§ 199.2
Definitions.
(a)
General.
In an effort to be as specific as possible as to the word and intent of CHAMPUS, the following definitions have been developed. While
many of the definitions are general and some assign meaning to relatively common terms within the health insurance environment, others are applicable only to CHAMPUS; however, they all appear in this part solely for the purpose of the Program. Except when otherwise specified, the definitions in this section apply generally throughout this part.
(b)
Specific definitions. Abortion.
Abortion means the intentional termination of a pregnancy by artificial means done for a purpose other than that of producing a live birth. A spontaneous, missed or threatened abortion or termination of an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy are not included within the term “abortion” as used herein.
Absent treatment.
Services performed by Christian Science practitioners for a person when the person is physically present.

# Note:
Technically, “Absent Treatment” is an obsolete term. The current Christian Science terminology is “treatment through prayer and spiritual means,” which is employed by an authorized Christian Science practitioner either with the beneficiary being present or absent. However, to be considered for coverage under CHAMPUS, the beneficiary must be present physically when a Christian Science service is rendered, regardless of the terminology used.
Abuse.
For the purposes of this part, abuse is defined as any practice that is inconsistent with accepted sound fiscal, business, or professional practice which results in a CHAMPUS claim, unnecessary cost, or CHAMPUS payment for services or supplies that are: (1) Not within the concepts of medically necessary and appropriate care, as defined in this part, or (2) that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care providers. The term “abuse” includes deception or misrepresentation by a provider, or any person or entity acting on behalf of a provider in relation to a CHAMPUS claim.

# Note:
Unless a specific action is deemed gross and flagrant, a pattern of inappropriate practice will normally be required to find that abuse has occurred. Also, any practice or action that constitutes fraud, as defined by this part, would also be abuse.
Abused dependent.
An eligible spouse or child, who meets the criteria in § 199.3 of this part, of a former member who received a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge or was dismissed from a Uniformed Service as a result of a court-martial conviction for an offense involving physical or emotional abuse or was administratively discharged as a result of such an offense,
or
of a member or former member who has had their entitlement to receive retired pay terminated because of misconduct involving physical or emotional abuse.
Accidental injury.
Physical bodily injury resulting from an external force, blow or fall, or the ingestion of a foreign body or harmful substance, requiring immediate medical treatment. Accidental injury also includes animal and insect bites and sunstrokes. For the purpose of CHAMPUS, the breaking of a tooth or teeth does not constitute a physical bodily injury.
Active duty.
Full-time duty in the Uniformed Services of the United States. It includes duty on the active list, full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance while in the active Military Service, at a school designated as a Service school by law or by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.
Active duty member.
A person on active duty in a Uniformed Service under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or less.
Activities of daily living.
Care that consists of providing food (including special diets), clothing, and shelter; personal hygiene services; observation and general monitoring; bowel training or management (unless abnormalities in bowel function are of a severity to result in a need for medical or surgical intervention in the absence of skilled services); safety precautions; general preventive procedures (such as turning to prevent bedsores); passive exercise; companionship; recreation; transportation; and such other elements of personal care that reasonably can be performed by an untrained adult with minimal instruction or supervision. Activities of daily living may also be referred to as “essentials of daily living”.
Acupuncture.
The practice of inserting needles into various body parts to pierce specific peripheral nerves for the
production of counter-irritation to relieve the discomfort of pain, induce surgical anesthesia, or for other treatment purposes.

# Note:
Acupuncture is not covered by CHAMPUS.
Adequate Medical Documentation, Medical Treatment Records.
Adequate medical documentation contains sufficient information to justify the diagnosis, the treatment plan, and the services and supplies furnished. Under CHAMPUS, it is required that adequate and sufficient clinical records be kept by the health care provider(s) to substantiate that specific care was actually and appropriately furnished, was medically necessary and appropriate (as defined by this part), and to identify the individual(s) who provided the care. All procedures billed must be documented in the records. In determining whether medical records are adequate, the records will be reviewed under the generally acceptable standards such as the applicable Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards, the Peer Review Organization (PRO) standards (and the provider's state or local licensing requirements) and other requirements specified by this part. In general, the documentation requirements for a professional provider are not less in the outpatient setting than the inpatient setting.
Adequate medical documentation, mental health records.
Adequate medical documentation provides the means for measuring the type, frequency, and duration of active treatment mechanisms employed and progress under the treatment plan. Under CHAMPUS, it is required that adequate and sufficient clinical records be kept by the provider to substantiate that specific care was actually and appropriately furnished, was medically or psychologically necessary (as defined by this part), and to identify the individual(s) who provided the care. Each service provided or billed must be documented in the records. In determining whether medical records are adequate, the records will be reviewed under the generally acceptable standards (
e.g.,
the standards of an accrediting organization approved by the Director, and the provider's state or local licensing requirements) and other requirements specified by this part. The psychiatric and psychological evaluations, physician orders, the treatment plan, integrated progress notes (and physician progress notes if separate from the integrated progress notes), and the discharge summary are the more critical elements of the mental health record. However, nursing and staff notes, no matter how complete, are not a substitute for the documentation of services by the individual professional provider who furnished treatment to the beneficiary. In general, the documentation requirements of a professional provider are not less in the outpatient setting than the inpatient setting. Furthermore, even though a hospital that provides psychiatric care may be accredited under The Joint Commission (TJC) manual for hospitals rather than the behavioral health standards manual, the critical elements of the mental health record listed above are required for CHAMPUS claims.
Adjunctive dental care.
Dental care which is medically necessary in the treatment of an otherwise covered medical (not dental) condition, is an integral part of the treatment of such medical condition and is essential to the control of the primary medical condition; or, is required in preparation for or as the result of dental trauma which may be or is caused by medically necessary treatment of an injury or disease (iatrogenic).
Admission.
The formal acceptance by a CHAMPUS authorized institutional provider of a CHAMPUS beneficiary for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment of illness, injury, pregnancy, or mental disorder.
Adopted child.
A child taken into one's own family by legal process and treated as one's own child. In case of adoption, CHAMPUS eligibility begins as of 12:01 a.m. of the day of the final adoption decree.

# Note:
There is no CHAMPUS benefit entitlement during any interim waiting period.
All-inclusive per diem rate.
The OCHAMPUS determined rate that encompasses the daily charge for inpatient care and, unless specifically excepted, all other treatment determined
necessary and rendered as part of the treatment plan established for a patient, and accepted by OCHAMPUS.
Allowable charge.
The CHAMPUS-determined level of payment to physicians, other individual professional providers and other providers, based on one of the approved reimbursement methods set forth in § 199.14 of this part. Allowable charge also may be referred to as the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable charge.
Allowable cost.
The CHAMPUS-determined level of payment to hospitals or other institutions, based on one of the approved reimbursement methods set fourth in § 199.14 of this part. Allowable cost may also be referred to as the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable cost.
Ambulance.
A specially designed vehicle for transporting the sick or injured that contains a stretcher, linens, first aid supplies, oxygen equipment, and such lifesaving equipment required by state and local law, and that is staffed by personnel trained to provide first aid treatment.
Ambulatory Payment Classifications
(APCs). Payment of services under the TRICARE OPPS is based on grouping outpatient procedures and services into ambulatory payment classification groups based on clinical and resource homogeneity, provider concentration, frequency of service and minimal opportunities for upcoding and code fragmentation. Nationally established rates for each APC are calculated by multiplying the APC's relative weight derived from median costs for procedures assigned to the APC group, scaled to the median cost of the APC group representing the most frequently provided services, by the conversion factor.
Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC).
Any distinct entity that is classified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as an Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) under 42 CFR part 416 and meets the applicable requirements established by § 199.6(b)(4)(x). Any ASC that would otherwise meet the CMS classification as an ASC but does not have a participation agreement with Medicare due to the nature of the patients they treat (
e.g.,
pediatric) must meet the applicable requirements established by § 199.6(b)(4)(x) in order to be a TRICARE authorized ASC. All ASCs must also enter into participation agreements with TRICARE as required by § 199.6(b)(4)(x) in order to be an authorized TRICARE provider of ASC services. Additionally, ASCs are prohibited from billing TRICARE beneficiaries for procedures that are not included in Medicare's ASC list of procedures allowable for facility fee payment in an ASC setting, unless the beneficiary agreed in advance in writing to pay for the non-covered services, in accordance with the “hold harmless” provision under § 199.6(b)(4)(x)(B)(

) and (
iii
).
Amount in dispute.
The amount of money, determined under this part, that CHAMPUS would pay for medical services and supplies involved in an adverse determination being appealed if the appeal were resolved in favor of the appealing party. See § 199.10 for additional information concerning the determination of “amount in dispute” under this part.
Anesthesia services.
The administration of an anesthetic agent by injection or inhalation, the purpose and effect of which is to produce surgical anesthesia characterized by muscular relaxation, loss of sensation, or loss of consciousness when administered by or under the direction of a physician or dentist in connection with otherwise covered surgery or obstetrical care, or shock therapy. Anesthesia services do not include hypnosis or acupuncture.
Appealable issue.
Disputed questions of fact which, if resolved in favor of the appealing party, would result in the authorization of CHAMPUS benefits, or approval as an authorized provider in accordance with this part. An appealable issue does not exist if no facts are in dispute, if no CHAMPUS benefits would be payable, or if there is no authorized provider, regardless of the resolution of any disputed facts. See § 199.10 for additional information concerning the determination of “appealable issue” under this part.
Appealing party.
Any party to the initial determination who files an appeal of an adverse determination or requests a hearing under the provisions of this part.
Appropriate medical care.
(i) Services performed in connection with the diagnosis or treatment of disease or injury, pregnancy, mental disorder, or well-baby care which are in keeping with the generally accepted norms for medical practice in the United States;

(iii) The services are furnished economically. For purposes of this part, “economically” means that the services are furnished in the least expensive level of care or medical environment adequate to provide the required medical care regardless of whether or not that level of care is covered by CHAMPUS.
Approved teaching programs.
For purposes of CHAMPUS, an approved teaching program is a program of graduate medical education which has been duly approved in its respective specialty or subspecialty by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education of the American Medical Association, by the Committee on Hospitals of the Bureau of Professional Education of the American Osteopathic Association, by the Council on Dental Education of the American Dental Association, or by the Council on Podiatry Education of the American Podiatry Association.

Assistive technology devices help an ECHO beneficiary overcome or remove a disability and are used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of an individual. Assistive technology devices may include non-medical devices but do not include any structural alterations (
e.g.,
permanent structure of wheelchair ramps or alterations to street curbs) service animals (
e.g.,
Seeing Eye dogs, hearing/handicapped assistance animals, etc.) or specialized equipment and devices whose primary purpose is to enable the individual to engage in sports or recreational events. Assistive technology devices are authorized only under coverage criteria determined by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity to assist in the reduction of the disabling effects of a qualifying condition for individuals eligible to receive benefits under the ECHO program, as provided in § 199.5.
Attending physician.
The physician who has the primary responsibility for the medical diagnosis and treatment of the patient. A consultant or an assistant surgeon, for example, would not be an attending physician. Under very extraordinary circumstances, because of the presence of complex, serious, and multiple, but unrelated, medical conditions, a patient may have more than one attending physician concurrently rendering medical treatment during a single period of time. An attending physician also may be a teaching physician.
Augmentative communication device (ACD).
A voice prosthesis as determined by the Secretary of Defense to be necessary because of significant conditions resulting from trauma, congenital anomalies, or disease. Also referred to as Speech Generating Device.
Authorized provider.
A hospital or institutional provider, physician, or other individual professional provider, or other provider of services or supplies specifically authorized to provide benefits under CHAMPUS in § 199.6 of this part.
Automobile liability insurance.
Automobile liability insurance means insurance against legal liability for health and medical expenses resulting from personal injuries arising from operation of a motor vehicle. Automobile liability insurance includes:
(1) Circumstances in which liability benefits are paid to an injured party only when the insured party's tortious acts are the cause of the injuries; and
(2) Uninsured and underinsured coverage, in which there is a third-party tortfeasor who caused the injuries (i.e., benefits are not paid on a no-fault basis), but the insured party is not the tortfeasor.
Backup hospital.
A hospital which is otherwise eligible as a CHAMPUS institutional provider and which is fully capable of providing emergency care to a patient who develops complications beyond the scope of services of a given category of CHAMPUS-authorized freestanding institutional provider and which is accessible from the site of the CHAMPUS-authorized freestanding institutional provider within an average transport time acceptable for the types of medical emergencies usually associated with the type of care provided by the freestanding facility.

It is presumed that, if a deception or misrepresentation is established
and
a CHAMPUS claim is filed, the person responsible for the claim had the requisite knowledge. This presumption is rebuttable only by substantial evidence. It is further presumed that the provider of the services is responsible for the actions of all individuals who file a claim on behalf of the provider (for example, billing clerks); this presumption may only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.

Homebound.
A beneficiary's condition is such that there exists a normal inability to leave home and, consequently, leaving home would require considerable and taxing effort. Any absence of an individual from the home attributable to the need to receive health care treatment—including regular absences for the purpose of participating in therapeutic, psychosocial, or medical treatment in an adult day-care program that is licensed or certified by a state, or accredited to furnish adult day-care services in the—state shall not disqualify an individual from being considered to be confined to his home. Any other absence of an individual from the home shall not disqualify an individual if the absence is infrequent or of relatively short duration. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any absence for the purpose of attending a religious service shall be deemed to be an absence of infrequent or short duration. Also, absences from the home for non-medical purposes, such as an occasional trip to the barber, a walk around the block or a drive, would not necessarily negate the beneficiary's homebound status if the absences are undertaken on an infrequent basis and are of relatively short duration. An exception is made to the above homebound definitional criteria for beneficiaries under the age of 18 and those receiving maternity care. The only homebound criteria for these special beneficiary categories is written certification from a physician attesting to the fact that leaving the home would place the beneficiary at medical risk.

(iv) It provides insurance reimbursement by making payment directly to the CHAMPUS beneficiary or to the participating provider.
(v) It does not operate in a manner which results in lower deductibles or cost-shares than those imposed by law,
or that waives the legally imposed deductibles or cost-shares.
(2) A supplemental insurance plan offered by a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) must meet all of the following criteria:
(i) The HMO must be authorized and must operate under relevant provisions of state law.

Eligibility.
(a)
General.
This section sets forth those persons who, by the provisions of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, and the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, are eligible for CHAMPUS benefits. A determination that a person is eligible does not automatically entitle such a person to CHAMPUS payments. Before any CHAMPUS benefits may be extended, additional requirements, as set forth in other sections of this part, must be met. Additionally, the use of CHAMPUS may be denied if a Uniformed Service medical treatment facility capable of providing the needed care is available. CHAMPUS relies primarily on the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) for eligibility verification.

(d)
Dual eligibility.
Dual eligibility occurs when a person is entitled to benefits from two sources. For example, when an active duty member is also the dependent of another active duty member, a retiree, or a deceased active duty member or retiree, dual eligibility, that is, entitlement to direct care from the Uniformed Services medical care system and CHAMPUS is the result. Since the active duty status is primary, and it is the intent that all medical care be provided an active duty member through the Uniformed Services medical care system, CHAMPUS eligibility is terminated as of 12:01 a.m. on the day following the day the dual eligibility begins. However, any dependent children in a marriage of two active duty persons or of an active duty member and a retiree, are CHAMPUS eligible in the same manner as dependent children of a marriage involving only one CHAMPUS sponsor. Should a spouse or dependent who has dual eligibility leave active duty status, that person's CHAMPUS eligibility is reinstated as of 12:01 a.m. of the day active duty ends, if he or she otherwise is eligible as a dependent of a CHAMPUS sponsor.

# Note:
No CHAMPUS eligibility arises as the result of the marriage of two active duty members.
(e)
Eligibility under the Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP).
(1) A member of the armed forces is eligible for transitional health care if the member is:
(i) A member who is involuntarily separated from active duty.
(ii) A member of a Reserve component who is separated from active duty to which called or ordered in support of a contingency operation if the active duty is active duty for a period of more than 30 consecutive days.
(iii) A member who is separated from active duty for which the member is involuntarily retained under 10 U.S.C. 12305 in support of a contingency operation; or
(iv) A member who is separated from active duty served pursuant to a voluntary agreement of the member to remain on active duty for a period of less than 1 year in support of a contingency operation.
(v) A member who receives a sole survivorship discharge (as defined in section 1174(i) of this title).
(vi) A member who is separated from Active Duty who agrees to become a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component.
(2) A spouse (as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section except former spouses) and child (as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) of a member described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is also eligible for TAMP benefits under TRICARE.
(3) TAMP benefits under TRICARE begin on the day after the member is separated from active duty, and, if such separation occurred on or after November 6, 2003, end 180 days after such date. TRICARE benefits available to both the member and eligible family members are generally those available to family members of members of the uniformed services under this Part. However, during TAMP eligibility, a member of a Reserve Component as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, is entitled to dental care to which a member of the uniformed services on active duty for more than 30 days is entitled. Each branch of service will determine eligibility for its members and eligible family members and provide data to DEERS.
(f)
Changes in status which result in termination of CHAMPUS eligibility.
Changes in status which result in a loss of CHAMPUS eligibility as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day the event occurred, unless otherwise indicated, are as follows:
(1)
Changes in the status of a member.
(i) When an active duty member's period of active duty ends, excluding retirement or death.
(ii) When an active duty member is placed on desertion status (eligibility is reinstated when the active duty member is removed from desertion status and returned to military control).

# Note:
A member serving a sentence of confinement in conjunction with a sentence of punitive discharge is still considered on active duty until such time as the discharge is executed.
(2)
Changes in the status of a retiree.
(i) When a retiree ceases to be entitled to retired, retainer, or equivalent pay for any reason, the retiree's dependents lose their eligibility unless the dependent is otherwise eligible (e.g., some former spouses, some dependents who are victims of abuse and some incapacitated children as outlined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(
2
) of this section).
(ii) A retiree also loses eligibility when no longer entitled to retired, retainer, or equivalent pay.

# Note:
A retiree who waives his or her retired, retainer or equivalent pay is still considered a retiree for the purposes of CHAMPUS eligibility.
(iii) Attainment of entitlement to hospital insurance benefits (Part A) under Medicare except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (f)(3)(vii), (f)(3)(viii) and (f)(3)(ix) of this section.
(3)
Changes in the status of a dependent.
(i) Divorce, except for certain classes of former spouses as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and the member or former member's
own
children (i.e., legitimate, adopted, and judicially determined illegitimate children).

# Note:
An unadopted stepchild loses eligibility as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day the divorce becomes final.
(ii) Annulment, except for certain classes of former spouse as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and the member or former member's
own
children (i.e., legitimate, adopted, and judicially determined illegitimate children).

# Note:
An unadopted stepchild loses eligibility as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day the annulment becomes final.
(iii) Adoption, except for adoptions occurring after the death of a member or former member.
(iv) Marriage of a child, except when the marriage is terminated by death, divorce, or annulment before the child is 21 or 23 if an incapacitated child as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(
2
) of this section.
(v) Marriage of a widow or widower, except for the child of the widow or widower who was the stepchild of the deceased member or former member at the time of death. The stepchild continues CHAMPUS eligibility as other classes of dependent children.
(vi) Attainment of entitlement to hospital insurance benefits (Part A) under Medicare except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (f)(3)(vii), (f)(3)(viii), and (f)(3)(ix) of this section. (This also applies to individuals living outside the United States where Medicare benefits are not available.)
(vii) Attainment of age 65, except for dependents of active duty members, beneficiaries not entitled to part A of Medicare, beneficiaries entitled to Part A of Medicare who have enrolled in Part B of Medicare, and as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For those who do not retain CHAMPUS, CHAMPUS eligibility is lost at 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the month in which the beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare.

# Note:
If the person is not eligible for Part A of Medicare, he or she must file a Social Security Administration, “Notice of Disallowance” certifying to that fact with the Uniformed Service responsible for the issuance of his or her identification card so a new card showing CHAMPUS eligibility can be issued. Individuals entitled only to supplementary medical insurance (Part B) of Medicare, but not Part A, or Part A through the Premium HI provisions (provided for under the 1972 Amendments to the Social Security Act) retain eligibility under CHAMPUS (refer to § 199.8 for additional information when a double coverage situation is involved).
(viii) End stage renal disease. All beneficiaries, except dependents of active duty members, lose their CHAMPUS eligibility when Medicare coverage becomes available to a person because of chronic renal disease unless the following conditions have been met. CHAMPUS eligibility will continue if:
(A) The individual is under 65 years old;
(B) The individual became eligible for Medicare under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 426-1(a);
(C) The individual is enrolled in Part B of Medicare; and
(D) The individual has applied and qualified for continued CHAMPUS eligibility through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).
(ix) Individuals with certain disabilities. Each case relating to Medicare eligibility resulting from being disabled requires individual investigation. All beneficiaries except dependents of active duty members lose their CHAMPUS eligibility when Medicare coverage becomes available to a disabled person unless the following conditions have been met. CHAMPUS eligibility will continue if:
(A) The individual is under 65 years old;
(B) The individual became eligible for Medicare under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 426(b)(2);
(C) The individual is enrolled in Part B of Medicare except that in the case of a retroactive determination of entitlement to Medicare Part A hospital insurance benefits for a person under 65 years of age there is no requirement to enroll in Medicare Part B from the Medicare Part A entitlement date until the issuance of such retroactive determination; and
(D) The individual has applied and qualified for continued CHAMPUS eligibility through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).
(x) Disabled students, that is children age 21 or 22, who are pursuing a full-time course of higher education and who, either during the school year or between semesters, suffer a disabling
illness or injury with resultant inability to resume attendance at the institution remain eligible for CHAMPUS medical benefits for 6 months after the disability is removed or until the student passes his or her 23rd birthday, whichever occurs first. However, if recovery occurs before the 23rd birthday and there is resumption of a full-time course of higher education, CHAMPUS benefits can be continued until the 23rd birthday. The normal vacation periods during an established school year do not change the eligibility status of a dependent child 21 or 22 years old in a full time student status. Unless an incapacitating condition existed before, and at the time of, a dependent child's 21st birthday, a dependent child 21 or 22 years old in student status
does not
have eligibility and
may not
qualify for eligibility under the requirements related to mental or physical incapacity as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(
2
) of this section.
(g)
Reinstatement of CHAMPUS eligibility.
Circumstances which result in reinstatement of CHAMPUS eligibility are as follows:
(1)
End Stage renal disease.
Unless CHAMPUS eligibility has been continued under paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of the section, when Medicare eligibility ceases for end-stage renal disease patients, CHAMPUS eligibility resumes if the person is otherwise still eligible. He or she is required to take action to be reinstated as a CHAMPUS beneficiary and to obtain a new identification card.
(2)
Disability.
Some disabilities are permanent, others temporary. Each case must be reviewed individually. Unless CHAMPUS eligibility has been continued under paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of this section, when disability ends and Medicare eligibility ceases, CHAMPUS eligibility resumes if the person is otherwise still eligible. Again, he or she is required to take action to obtain a new CHAMPUS identification card.
(3)
Enrollment in Medicare Part B.
For individuals whose CHAMPUS eligibility has terminated pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iii) or (f)(3)(vi) of this section due to beneficiary action to decline Part B of Medicare, CHAMPUS eligibility resumes, effective on the date Medicare Part B coverage begins, if the person subsequently enrolls in Medicare Part B and the person is otherwise still eligible.
(h)
Determination of eligibility status.
Determination of an individual's eligibility as a CHAMPUS beneficiary is the primary responsibility of the Uniformed Service in which the member or former member is, or was, a member, or in the case of dependents of a NATO military member, the Service that sponsors the NATO member. For the purpose of program integrity, the appropriate Uniformed Service shall, upon request of the Director, OCHAMPUS, review the eligibility of a specific person when there is reason to question the eligibility status. In such cases, a report on the results of the review and any action taken will be submitted to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(i)
Procedures for determination of eligibility.
Procedures for the determination of eligibility are prescribed within the Department of Defense Instruction 1000.13 available at local military facilities personnel offices.
(j)
CHAMPUS procedures for verification of eligibility.
(1) Eligibility for CHAMPUS benefits will be verified through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) maintained by the Uniformed Services, except for abused dependents as set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. It is the responsibility of the CHAMPUS beneficiary, or parent, or legal representative, when appropriate, to provide the necessary evidence required for entry into the DEERS file to establish CHAMPUS eligibility and to ensure that all changes in status that may affect eligibility be reported immediately to the appropriate Uniformed Service for action.
(2) Ineligibility for CHAMPUS benefits may be presumed in the absence of prescribed eligibility evidence in the DEERS file.
(3) The Director, OCHAMPUS, shall issue guidelines as necessary to implement the provisions of this section.
[64 FR 46135, Aug. 24, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 9654, Feb. 9, 2001; 66 FR 16400, Mar. 26, 2001; 66 FR 40606, Aug. 3, 2001; 67 FR 15725, Apr. 3, 2002; 68 FR 23032, Apr. 30, 2003; 68 FR 32361, May 30, 2003; 69 FR 51564, Aug. 20, 2004; 69 FR 60554, Oct. 12, 2004; 70 FR 12802, Mar. 16, 2005; 72 FR 2447, Jan. 19, 2007; 75 FR 50883, Aug. 18, 2010; 76 FR 81367, Dec. 28, 2011; 77 FR 38176, June 27, 2012; 80 FR 55254, Sept. 15, 2015]
§ 199.4
Basic program benefits.
(a)
General.
The CHAMPUS Basic Program is essentially a supplemental program to the Uniformed Services direct medical care system. The Basic Program is similar to private insurance programs, and is designed to provide financial assistance to CHAMPUS beneficiaries for certain prescribed medical care obtained from civilian sources.
(1)(i)
Scope of benefits.
Subject to all applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, or exclusions specified in this part, the CHAMPUS Basic Program will pay for medically or psychologically necessary services and supplies required in the diagnosis and treatment of illness or injury, including maternity care and well-baby care. Benefits include specified medical services and supplies provided to eligible beneficiaries from authorized civilian sources such as hospitals, other authorized institutional providers, physicians, other authorized individual professional providers, and professional ambulance service, prescription drugs, authorized medical supplies, and rental or purchase of durable medical equipment.
(ii)
Impact of TRICARE program.
The basic program benefits set forth in this section are applicable to the basic CHAMPUS program. In areas in which the TRICARE program is implemented, certain provisions of § 199.17 will apply instead of the provisions of this section. In those areas, the provisions of § 199.17 will take precedence over any provisions of this section with which they conflict.
(2)
Persons eligible for Basic Program benefits.
Persons eligible to receive the Basic Program benefits are set forth in § 199.3 of this part. Any person determined to be an eligible CHAMPUS beneficiary is eligible for Basic Program benefits.
(3)
Authority to act for CHAMPUS.
The authority to make benefit determinations and authorize the disbursement of funds under CHAMPUS is restricted to the Director, OCHAMPUS; designated OCHAMPUS staff; Director, OCHAMPUSEUR; or CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries. No other persons or agents (such as physicians, staff members of hospitals, or CHAMPUS health benefits advisors) have such authority.
(4)
Status of patient controlling for purposes of cost-sharing.
Benefits for covered services and supplies described in this section will be extended either on an inpatient or outpatient cost-sharing basis in accordance with the status of the patient at the time the covered services and supplies were provided, unless otherwise specifically designated (such as for ambulance service or maternity care). For cost-sharing provisions, refer to paragraph (f) of this section.
(5)
Right to information.
As a condition precedent to the provision of benefits hereunder, OCHAMPUS or its CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries shall be entitled to receive information from a physician or hospital or other person, institution, or organization (including a local, state, or U.S. Government agency) providing services or supplies to the beneficiary for which claims or requests for approval for benefits are submitted. Such information and records may relate to the attendance, testing, monitoring, or examination or diagnosis of, or treatment rendered, or services and supplies furnished to a beneficiary, and shall be necessary for the accurate and efficient administration of CHAMPUS benefits. Before a determination will be made on a request for preauthorization or claim of benefits, a beneficiary or sponsor must provide particular additional information relevant to the requested determination, when necessary. The recipient of such information shall in every case hold such records confidential except when:
(i) Disclosure of such information is authorized specifically by the beneficiary;
(ii) Disclosure is necessary to permit authorized governmental officials to
investigate and prosecute criminal actions, or
(iii) Disclosure is authorized or required specifically under the terms of the Privacy Act or Freedom of Information Act (refer to § 199.1(m) of this part).
For the purposes of determining the applicability of and implementing the provisions of §§ 199.8, 199.11, and 199.12, or any provision of similar purpose of any other medical benefits coverage or entitlement, OCHAMPUS or CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries may release, without consent or notice to any beneficiary or sponsor, to any person, organization, government agency, provider, or other entity any information with respect to any beneficiary when such release constitutes a routine use published in the
Federal Register
in accordance with DoD 5400.11-R (Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a)). Before a person's claim of benefits will be adjudicated, the person must furnish to CHAMPUS information that reasonably may be expected to be in his or her possession and that is necessary to make the benefit determination. Failure to provide the requested information may result in denial of the claim.
(6)
Physical examinations.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may require a beneficiary to submit to one or more medical (including psychiatric) examinations to determine the beneficiary's entitlement to benefits for which application has been made or for otherwise authorized medically necessary services and supplies required in the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury (including maternity and well-baby care). When a medical examination has been requested, CHAMPUS will withhold payment of any pending claims or preauthorization requests on that particular beneficiary. If the beneficiary refuses to agree to the requested medical examination, or unless prevented by a medical reason acceptable to OCHAMPUS, the examination is not performed within 90 days of initial request, all pending claims for services and supplies will be denied. A denial of payments for services or supplies provided before (and related to) the request for a physical examination is not subject to reconsideration. The medical examination and required beneficiary travel related to performing the requested medical examination will be at the expense of CHAMPUS. The medical examination may be performed by a physician in a Uniformed Services medical facility or by an appropriate civilian physician, as determined and selected by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee who is responsible for making such arrangements as are necessary, including necessary travel arrangements.
(7)
Claims filing deadline.
For all services provided on or after January 1, 1993, to be considered for benefits, all claims submitted for benefits must, except as provided in § 199.7, be filed with the appropriate CHAMPUS contractor no later than one year after the services are provided. Unless the requirement is waived, failure to file a claim within this deadline waives all rights to benefits for such services or supplies.
(8)
Double coverage and third party recoveries.
CHAMPUS claims involving double coverage or the possibility that the United States can recover all or a part of its expenses from a third party, are specifically subject to the provisions of § 199.8 or § 199.12 of this part as appropriate.
(9)
Nonavailability Statements within a 40-mile catchment area.
Unless required by action of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)) under this paragraph (a)(9), nonavailability statements are not required. If they are required by ASD(HA) action, in some geographic locations, CHAMPUS beneficiaries not enrolled in TRICARE Prime may be required to obtain a nonavailability statement from a military medical treatment facility in order to receive specifically identified health care services from a civilian provider. If the required care cannot be provided through the Uniformed Service facility, the hospital commander, or a designee, will issue a Nonavailability Statement (NAS) (DD Form 1251). Failure to secure such a statement may waive the beneficiary's rights to benefits under CHAMPUS/TRICARE.
(i) With the exception of maternity services, the ASD(HA) may require an NAS prior to TRICARE cost-sharing
for additional services from civilian sources if such services are to be provided to a beneficiary who lives within a 40-mile catchment area of an MTF where such services are available and the ASD(HA):
(A) Demonstrates that significant costs would be avoided by performing specific procedures at the affected MTF or MTFs; or
(B) Determines that a specific procedure must be provided at the affected MTF or MTFs to ensure the proficiency levels of the practitioners at the MTF or MTFs; or
(C) Determines that the lack of NAS data would significantly interfere with TRICARE contract administration; and
(D) Provides notification of the ASD(HA)'s intent to require an NAS under this authority to covered beneficiaries who receive care at the MTF or MTFs that will be affected by the decision to require an NAS under this authority; and
(E) Provides at least 60-day notification to the Committees on Armed Services of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the ASD(HA)'s intent to require an NAS under this authority, the reason for the NAS requirement, and the date that an NAS will be required.
(ii) Rules in effect at the time civilian medical care is provided apply. The applicable rules and regulations regarding Nonavailability Statements in effect at the time the civilian care is rendered apply in determining whether a NAS is required.
(iii) The Director, TMA is responsible for issuing the procedural rules and regulations regarding Nonavailability Statements. Such rules and regulations should address:
(A) When and for what services a NAS is required. However, a NAS may not be required for services otherwise available at an MTF located within a 40-mile radius of the beneficiary's residence when another insurance plan or program provides the beneficiary's primary coverage for the services. This requirement for an NAS does not apply to beneficiaries enrolled in TRICARE Prime, even when those beneficiaries use the point-of-service option under § 199.17(n)(3) of this part; and
(B) When and how notifications will be made to a beneficiary who is not enrolled in TRICARE Prime as to whether or not he or she resides in a geographic area that requires obtaining a NAS; and
(C) What information relating to claims submissions, including the documentation, if any, that is required to document that a valid NAS was issued. However, when documentation of a NAS is required, then that documentation shall be valid for the adjudication of CHAMPUS claims for all related care otherwise authorized by this part which is received from a civilian source while the beneficiary resided within the Uniformed Service facility catchment area which issued the NAS.
(iv) In the case of any service subject to a NAS requirement under this paragraph (a)(9) and also subject to a preadmission (or other pre-service) authorization requirement under § 199.4 or § 199.15 of this part, the administrative processes for the NAS and pre-service authorization may be combined.

Implementing instructions.
The Director, OCHAMPUS shall issue policies, procedures, instructions, guidelines, standards and/or criteria to implement this section.
(14
) Confidentiality of substance use disorder treatment.
Release of any patient identifying information, including that required to adjudicate a claim, must comply with the provisions of section 543 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 290dd-2), and implementing regulations at 42 CFR part 2, which governs the release of medical and other information from the records of patients undergoing treatment of substance use disorder. If the patient refuses to authorize the release of medical records which are, in the opinion of the Director, Defense Health Agency, or a designee, necessary to determine benefits on a claim
for treatment of substance use disorder, the claim will be denied.
(b)
Institutional benefits
—(1)
General.
Services and supplies provided by an institutional provider authorized as set forth in § 199.6 may be cost-shared only when such services or supplies: are otherwise authorized by this part; are medically necessary; are ordered, directed, prescribed, or delivered by an OCHAMPUS-authorized individual professional provider as set forth in § 199.6 or by an employee of the authorized institutional provider who is otherwise eligible to be a CHAMPUS authorized individual professional provider; are delivered in accordance with generally accepted norms for clinical practice in the United States; meet established quality standards; and comply with applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, exceptions, or exclusions as otherwise set forth in this part.
(i)
Billing practices.
To be considered for benefits under § 199.4(b), covered services and supplies must be provided and billed for by a hospital or other authorized institutional provider. Such billings must be fully itemized and sufficiently descriptive to permit CHAMPUS to determine whether benefits are authorized by this part. Depending on the individual circumstances, teaching physician services may be considered an institutional benefit in accordance with § 199.4(b) or a professional benefit under § 199.4(c). See paragraph (c)(3)(xiii) of this section for the CHAMPUS requirements regarding teaching physicians. In the case of continuous care, claims shall be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days either by the beneficiary or sponsor or, on a participating basis, directly by the facility on behalf of the beneficiary (refer to § 199.7).
(ii)
Successive inpatient admissions.
Successive inpatient admissions shall be deemed one inpatient confinement for the purpose of computing the active duty dependent's share of the inpatient institutional charges, provided not more than 60 days have elapsed between the successive admissions, except that successive inpatient admissions related to a single maternity episode shall be considered one confinement, regardless of the number of days between admissions. For the purpose of applying benefits, successive admissions will be determined separately for maternity admissions and admissions related to an accidental injury (refer to § 199.4(f)).
(iii)
Related services and supplies.
Covered services and supplies must be rendered in connection with and related directly to a covered diagnosis or definitive set of symptoms requiring otherwise authorized medically necessary treatment.
(iv)
Inpatient, appropriate level required.
For purposes of inpatient care, the level of institutional care for which Basic Program benefits may be extended must be at the appropriate level required to provide the medically necessary treatment except for patients requiring skilled nursing facility care. For patients for whom skilled nursing facility care is adequate, but is not available in the general locality, benefits may be continued in the higher level care facility. General locality means an area that includes all the skilled nursing facilities within 50 miles of the higher level facility, unless the higher level facility can demonstrate that the skilled nursing facilities are inaccessible to its patients. The decision as to whether a skilled nursing facility is within the higher level facility's general locality, or the skilled nursing facility is inaccessible to the higher level facility's patients shall be a CHAMPUS contractor initial determination for the purposes of appeal under § 199.10 of this part. CHAMPUS institutional benefit payments shall be limited to the allowable cost that would have been incurred in the skilled nursing facility, as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. If it is determined that the institutional care can be provided reasonably in the home setting, no CHAMPUS institutional benefits are payable.
(v)
General or special education not covered.
Services and supplies related to the provision of either regular or special education generally are not covered. Such exclusion applies whether a separate charge is made for education or whether it is included as a part of an overall combined daily charge of an institution. In the latter
instance, that portion of the overall combined daily charge related to education must be determined, based on the allowable costs of the educational component, and deleted from the institution's charges before CHAMPUS benefits can be extended. The only exception is when appropriate education is not available from or not payable by the cognizant public entity. Each case must be referred to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, for review and a determination of the applicability of CHAMPUS benefits.
(vi)
Substance use disorder treatment exclusions.
(A) The programmed use of physical measures, such as electric shock, alcohol, or other drugs as negative reinforcement (aversion therapy) is not covered, even if recommended by a physician.
(B)

Covered services in SNFs are the same as provided under Medicare under section 1861(h) and (i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(h) and (i)) and 42 CFR part 409, subparts C and D, except that the Medicare limitation on the number of days of coverage under section 1812(a) and (b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395d(a) and (b)) and 42 CFR 409.61(b) shall not be applicable under TRICARE. Skilled nursing facility care for each spell of illness shall continue to be provided for as long as medically necessary and appropriate. For a SNF admission to be covered under TRICARE, the beneficiary must have a qualifying hospital stay meaning an inpatient hospital stay of three consecutive days or more, not including the hospital leave day. The beneficiary must enter the SNF within 30 days of leaving the hospital, or within such time as it would be medically appropriate to begin an active course of treatment, where the individual's condition is such that SNF care would not be medically appropriate within 30 days after discharge from a hospital. The skilled services must be for a medical condition that was either treated during the qualifying three-day hospital stay, or started while the beneficiary was already receiving covered SNF care. Additionally, an individual shall be deemed not to have been discharged from a SNF, if within 30 days after discharge from a SNF, the individual is again admitted to a SNF. Adoption by TRICARE of most Medicare coverage standards does not include Medicare coinsurance amounts. Extended care services furnished to an inpatient of a SNF by such SNF (except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(xiv)(C), (b)(3)(xiv)(F), and (b)(3)(xiv)(G) of this section) include:
(A) Nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a registered professional nurse;
(B) Bed and board in connection with the furnishing of such nursing care;
(C) Physical or occupational therapy or speech-language pathology services
furnished by the SNF or by others under arrangements with them by the facility;
(D) Medical social services;
(E) Such drugs, biological, supplies, appliances, and equipment, furnished for use in the SNF, as are ordinarily furnished for the care and treatment of inpatients;
(F) Medical services provided by an intern or resident-in-training of a hospital with which the facility has such an agreement in effect; and
(G) Such other services necessary to the health of the patients as are generally provided by SNFs, or by others under arrangements with them made by the facility.
(xv)
Other medical services.
Other medical services may be authorized by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, provided they are related directly to the diagnosis or definitive set of symptoms and rendered by a member of the institution's medical or professional staff (either salaried or contractual) and billed for by the authorized institutional provider of care.
(xvi)
Medication assisted treatment.
Covered drugs and medicines for the treatment of substance use disorder include the substitution of a therapeutic drug, with addictive potential, for a drug addiction when medically or psychologically necessary and appropriate medical care for a beneficiary undergoing supervised treatment for a substance use disorder.
(xvii)
Withdrawal management (detoxification).
For a beneficiary undergoing treatment for a substance use disorder, this includes management of a patient's withdrawal symptoms (detoxification).
(4)
Services and supplies provided by RTCs

Treatment of mental disorders.
Services and supplies that are medically or psychologically necessary to diagnose and treat the mental disorder for which the patient was admitted to the RTC. Covered services and requirements for qualifications of providers are as listed in paragraph (c)(3)(ix) of this section.
(vi)
Other necessary medical care.
Emergency medical services or other authorized medical care may be rendered by the RTC provided it is professionally capable of rendering such services and meets standards required by the Director, OCHAMPUS. It is intended, however, that CHAMPUS payments to an RTC should primarily cover those services and supplies directly related to the treatment of mental disorders that require residential care.
(vii)
Criteria for determining medical or psychological necessity.
In determining the medical or psychological necessity of services and supplies provided by RTCs, the evaluation conducted by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) shall consider the appropriate level of care for the patient, the intensity of services required by the patient, and the availability of that care. In addition to the criteria set forth in this paragraph (b)(4) of this section, additional evaluation standards, consistent with such criteria, may be adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee). RTC services and supplies shall not be considered medically or psychologically necessary unless, at a minimum,
all
the following criteria are clinically determined in the evaluation to be fully met:
(A) Patient has a diagnosable psychiatric disorder.
(B) Patient exhibits patterns of disruptive behavior with evidence of disturbances in family functioning or social relationships and persistent psychological and/or emotional disturbances.
(C) RTC services involve active clinical treatment under an individualized treatment plan that provides for:

) Specific level of care, and measurable goals/objectives relevant to each of the problems identified;
(
2
) Skilled interventions by qualified mental health professionals to assist the patient and/or family;
(
3
) Time frames for achieving proposed outcomes; and
(
4
) Evaluation of treatment progress to include timely reviews and updates as appropriate of the patient's treatment plan that reflects alterations in the treatment regimen, the measurable goals/objectives, and the level of care required for each of the patient's problems, and explanations of any failure to achieve the treatment goals/objectives.
(D) Unless therapeutically contraindicated, the family and/or guardian must actively participate in the continuing care of the patient either through direct involvement at the facility or geographically distant family therapy. (In the latter case, the treatment center must document that there has been collaboration with the family and/or guardian in all reviews.)
(5)
Extent of institutional benefits
—(i)
Inpatient room accommodations
—(A)
Semiprivate.
The allowable costs for room and board furnished an individual patient are payable for semiprivate accommodations in a hospital or other authorized institution, subject to appropriate cost-sharing provisions (refer to paragraph (f) of this section). A semiprivate accommodation is a room containing at least two beds. Therefore, if a room publicly is designated by the institution as a semiprivate accommodation and contains multiple beds, it qualifies as semiprivate for the purpose of CHAMPUS.
(B)
Private.
A room with one bed that is designated as a private room by the hospital or other authorized institutional provider. The allowable cost of a private room accommodation is covered only under the following conditions:
(
1
) When its use is required medically and when the attending physician certifies that a private room is necessary medically for the proper care and treatment of a patient; or
(
2
) When a patient's medical condition requires isolation; or
(
3
) When a patient (in need of immediate inpatient care but not requiring a private room) is admitted to a hospital or other authorized institution that has semiprivate accommodations, but at the time of admission, such accommodations are occupied; or
(
4
) When a patient is admitted to an acute care hospital (general or special) without semiprivate rooms.
(C)
Duration of private room stay.
The allowable cost of private accommodations is covered under the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section until the patient's condition no longer requires the private room for medical reasons or medical isolation; or, in the case of the patient not requiring a private room, when a semiprivate accommodation becomes available; or, in the case of an acute care hospital (general or special) which does not have semiprivate rooms, for the duration of an otherwise covered inpatient stay.
(D)
Hospital (except an acute care hospital, general or special) or other authorized institutional provider without semiprivate accommodations.
When a beneficiary is admitted to a hospital (except an acute care hospital, general or special) or other institution that has no semiprivate accommodations, for any inpatient day when the patient qualifies for use of a private room (as set forth in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(B) (
1
) and (
2
) of this section) the allowable cost of private accommodations is covered. For any inpatient day in such a hospital or other authorized institution when the patient does not require medically the private room, the allowable cost of semiprivate accommodations is covered, such allowable costs to be determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(ii)
General staff nursing services.
General staff nursing services cover all nursing care (other than that provided by private duty nurses) including, but not limited to, general duty nursing, emergency room nursing, recovery room nursing, intensive nursing care, and group nursing arrangements. Only nursing services provided by nursing personnel on the payroll of the hospital
or other authorized institution are eligible under paragraph (b) of this section. If a nurse who is not on the payroll of the hospital or other authorized institution is called in specifically to care for a single patient (individual nursing) or more than one patient (group nursing), whether the patient is billed for the nursing services directly or through the hospital or other institution, such services constitute private duty (special) nursing services and are not eligible for benefits under this paragraph (the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(xv) of this section would apply).
(iii)
ICU.
An ICU is a special segregated unit of a hospital in which patients are concentrated, by reason of serious illness, usually without regard to diagnosis. Special lifesaving techniques and equipment are available regularly and immediately within the unit, and patients are under continuous observation by a nursing staff specially trained and selected for the care of this type of patient. The unit is maintained on a continuing, rather than an intermittent or temporary, basis. It is not a postoperative recovery room or a postanesthesia room. In some large or highly specialized hospitals, the ICUs may be refined further for special purposes, such as for respiratory conditions, cardiac surgery, coronary care, burn care, or neurosurgery. For purposes of CHAMPUS, these specialized units would be considered ICUs if they otherwise conformed to the definition of an ICU.
(iv)
Treatment rooms.
Standard treatment rooms include emergency rooms, operating rooms, recovery rooms, special treatment rooms, and hyperbaric chambers and all related necessary medical staff and equipment. To be recognized for purposes of CHAMPUS, treatment rooms must be so designated and maintained by the hospital or other authorized institutions on a continuing basis. A treatment room set up on an intermittent or temporary basis would not be so recognized.
(v)
Drugs and medicines.
Drugs and medicines are included as a supply of a hospital or other authorized institution only under the following conditions:
(A) They represent a cost to the facility rendering treatment;
(B) They are furnished to a patient receiving treatment, and are related directly to that treatment; and
(C) They are ordinarily furnished by the facility for the care and treatment of inpatients.
(vi)
Durable medical equipment, medical supplies, and dressings.
Durable medical equipment, medical supplies, and dressings are included as a supply of a hospital or other authorized institution only under the following conditions:
(A) If ordinarily furnished by the facility for the care and treatment of patients; and
(B) If specifically related to, and in connection with, the condition for which the patient is being treated; and
(C) If ordinarily furnished to a patient for use in the hospital or other authorized institution (except in the case of a temporary or disposable item); and
(D) Use of durable medical equipment is limited to those items provided while the patient is an inpatient. If such equipment is provided for use on an outpatient basis, the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section apply.
(vii)
Transitional use items.
Under certain circumstances, a temporary or disposable item may be provided for use beyond an inpatient stay, when such item is necessary medically to permit or facilitate the patient's departure from the hospital or other authorized institution, or which may be required until such time as the patient can obtain a continuing supply; or it would be unreasonable or impossible from a medical standpoint to discontinue the patient's use of the item at the time of termination of his or her stay as an inpatient.
(viii)
Anesthetics and oxygen.
Anesthetics and oxygen and their administration are considered a service or supply if furnished by the hospital or other authorized institution, or by others under arrangements made by the facility under which the billing for such services is made through the facility.
(6)
Inpatient mental health services.
Inpatient mental health services are those services furnished by institutional and professional providers for
treatment of a nervous or mental disorder (as defined in § 199.2) to a patient admitted to a CHAMPUS-authorized acute care general hospital; a psychiatric hospital; or, unless otherwise exempted, a special institutional provider.
(i)
Criteria for determining medical or psychological necessity.
In determining the medical or psychological necessity of acute inpatient mental health services, the evaluation conducted by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) shall consider the appropriate level of care for the patient, the intensity of services required by the patient, and the availability of that care. The purpose of such acute inpatient care is to stabilize a life-threatening or severely disabling condition within the context of a brief, intensive model of inpatient care in order to permit management of the patient's condition at a less intensive level of care. Such care is appropriate only if the patient requires services of an intensity and nature that are generally recognized as being effectively and safely provided only in an acute inpatient hospital setting. In addition to the criteria set forth in this paragraph (b)(6) of this section, additional evaluation standards, consistent with such criteria, may be adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee). Acute inpatient care shall not be considered necessary unless the patient needs to be observed and assessed on a 24-hour basis by skilled nursing staff, and/or requires continued intervention by a multidisciplinary treatment team; and in addition, at least one of the following criteria is determined to be met:
(A) Patient poses a serious risk of harm to self and/or others.
(B) Patient is in need of high dosage, intensive medication or somatic and/or psychological treatment, with potentially serious side effects.
(C) Patient has acute disturbances of mood, behavior, or thinking.
(ii)
Emergency admissions.
Admission to an acute inpatient hospital setting may be on an emergency or on a non-emergency basis. In order for an admission to qualify as an emergency, the following criteria, in addition to those in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, must be met:
(A) The patient must be at immediate risk of serious harm to self and or others based on a psychiatric evaluation performed by a physician (or other qualified mental health professional with hospital admission authority); and
(B) The patient requires immediate continuous skilled observation and treatment at the acute psychiatric level of care.
(iii)-(iv)[Reserved]
(7)
Emergency inpatient hospital services.
In the case of a medical emergency, benefits can be extended for medically necessary inpatient services and supplies provided to a beneficiary by a hospital, including hospitals that do not meet CHAMPUS standards or comply with the nondiscrimination requirements under title VI of the Civil Rights Act and other nondiscrimination laws applicable to recipients of federal financial assistance, or satisfy other conditions herein set forth. In a medical emergency, medically necessary inpatient services and supplies are those that are necessary to prevent the death or serious impairment of the health of the patient, and that, because of the threat to the life or health of the patient, necessitate, the use of the most accessible hospital available and equipped to furnish such services. Emergency services are covered when medically necessary for the active medical treatment of the acute phases of substance withdrawal (detoxification), for stabilization and for treatment of medical complications for substance use disorder. The availability of benefits depends upon the following three separate findings and continues only as long as the emergency exists, as determined by medical review. If the case qualified as an emergency at the time of admission to an unauthorized institutional provider and the emergency subsequently is determined no longer to exist, benefits will be extended up through the date of notice to the beneficiary and provider that CHAMPUS benefits no longer are payable in that hospital.
(i)
Existence of medical emergency.
A determination that a medical emergency existed with regard to the patient's condition;
(ii)
Immediate admission required.
A determination that the condition causing the medical emergency required immediate admission to a hospital to provide the emergency care; and
(iii)
Closest hospital utilized.
A determination that diagnosis or treatment was received at the most accessible (closest) hospital available and equipped to furnish the medically necessary care.
(8)
Residential treatment for substance use disorder
—(i)
In general.
Rehabilitative care, to include withdrawal management (detoxification), in an inpatient residential setting of an authorized hospital or substance use disorder rehabilitative facility, whether free-standing or hospital-based, is covered on a residential basis. The medical necessity for the management of withdrawal symptoms must be documented. Any withdrawal management (detoxification) services provided by the substance use disorder rehabilitation facility must be under general medical supervision.
(ii)
Criteria for determining medical or psychological necessity of residential treatment for substance use disorder.
Residential treatment for substance use disorder will be considered necessary only if all of the following conditions are present:
(A) The patient has been diagnosed with a substance use disorder.
(B) The patient is experiencing withdrawal symptoms or potential symptoms severe enough to require inpatient care and physician management, or who have less severe symptoms that require 24-hour inpatient monitoring or the patient's addiction-related symptoms, or concomitant physical and emotional/behavioral problems reflect persistent dysfunction in several major life areas.
(iii)
Services and supplies.
The following services and supplies are included in the per diem rate approved for an authorized residential treatment for substance use disorder.
(A)
Room and board.
Includes use of the residential treatment program facilities such as food service (including special diets), laundry services, supervised therapeutically constructed recreational and social activities, and other general services as considered appropriate by the Director, or a designee.
(B)

Includes the assessment of each individual accepted by the facility, and must, at a minimum, consist of a physical examination; psychiatric examination; psychological assessment; assessment of physiological, biological and cognitive processes; case management assessment; developmental assessment; family history and assessment; social history and assessment; educational or vocational history and assessment; environmental assessment; and recreational/activities assessment. Assessments conducted within 30 days prior to admission to a residential treatment program for substance use disorder (SUD) may be used if approved and deemed adequate to permit treatment planning by the residential treatment program for SUD.
(C)
Psychological testing.
Psychological testing is provided based on medical and psychological necessity.
(D)
Treatment services.
All services, supplies, equipment and space necessary to fulfill the requirements of each patient's individualized diagnosis and treatment plan. All mental health services must be provided by a TRICARE authorized individual professional provider of mental health services. [Exception: Residential treatment programs that employ individuals with master's or doctoral level degrees in a mental health discipline who do not meet the licensure, certification, and experience requirements for a qualified mental health provider but are actively working toward licensure or certification may provide services within the all-inclusive per diem rate, but such individuals must work under the clinical supervision of a fully qualified mental health provider employed by the facility.]
(iv)
Case management required.
The facility must provide case management that helps to assure arrangement of community based support services, referral of suspected child or elder abuse or domestic violence to the appropriate state agencies, and effective after care arrangements, at a minimum.
(v)
Professional mental health benefits.
Professional mental health benefits are billed separately from the residential treatment program per diem rate only
when rendered by an attending, TRICARE authorized mental health professional who is not an employee of, or under contract with, the program for purposes of providing clinical patient care.
(vi)
Non-mental health related medical services.
Separate billing will be allowed for otherwise covered non-mental health related services.
(9)
Psychiatric and substance use disorder partial hospitalization services
—(i)
In general.
Partial hospitalization services are those services furnished by a TRICARE authorized partial hospitalization program and authorized mental health providers for the active treatment of a mental disorder. All services must follow a medical model and vest patient care under the general direction of a licensed TRICARE authorized physician employed by the partial hospitalization program to ensure medication and physical needs of all the patients are considered. The primary or attending provider must be a TRICARE authorized mental health provider (see paragraph (c)(3)(ix) of this section), operating within the scope of his/her license. These categories include physicians, clinical psychologists, certified psychiatric nurse specialists, clinical social workers, marriage and family counselors, TRICARE certified mental health counselors, pastoral counselors, and supervised mental health counselors. All categories practice independently except pastoral counselors and supervised mental health counselors who must practice under the supervision of TRICARE authorized physicians. Partial hospitalization services and interventions are provided at a high degree of intensity and restrictiveness of care, with medical supervision and medication management. Partial hospitalization services are covered as a basic program benefit only if they are provided in accordance with paragraph (b)(9) of this section. Such programs must enter into a participation agreement with TRICARE; and be accredited and in substantial compliance with the specified standards of an accreditation organization approved by the Director.
(ii)
Criteria for determining medical or psychological necessity of psychiatric and SUD partial hospitalization services.
Partial hospitalization services will be considered necessary only if all of the following conditions are present:
(A) The patient is suffering significant impairment from a mental disorder (as defined in § 199.2) which interferes with age appropriate functioning or the patient is in need of rehabilitative services for the management of withdrawal symptoms from alcohol, sedative-hypnotics, opioids, or stimulants that require medically-monitored ambulatory detoxification, with direct access to medical services and clinically intensive programming of rehabilitative care based on individual treatment plans.
(B) The patient is unable to maintain himself or herself in the community, with appropriate support, at a sufficient level of functioning to permit an adequate course of therapy exclusively on an outpatient basis, to include outpatient treatment program, outpatient office visits, or intensive outpatient services (but is able, with appropriate support, to maintain a basic level of functioning to permit partial hospitalization services and presents no substantial imminent risk of harm to self or others). These patients require medical support; however, they do not require a 24-hour medical environment.
(C) The patient is in need of crisis stabilization, acute symptom reduction, treatment of partially stabilized mental health disorders, or services as a transition from an inpatient program.
(D) The admission into the partial hospitalization program is based on the development of an individualized diagnosis and treatment plan expected to be effective for that patient and permit treatment at a less intensive level.
(iii)
Services and supplies.
The following services and supplies are included in the per diem rate approved for an authorized partial hospitalization program:

—(i)
In general.
Intensive outpatient services are those services furnished by a TRICARE authorized intensive outpatient program and qualified mental health provider(s) for the active treatment of a mental disorder, to include substance use disorder.
(ii)
Criteria for determining medical or psychological necessity of intensive outpatient services.
In determining the medical or psychological necessity of intensive outpatient services, the evaluation conducted by the Director, or designee, shall consider the appropriate level of care, based on the patient's clinical needs and characteristics matched to a service's structure and intensity. In addition to the criteria set for this paragraph (b)(10) of this section, additional evaluation standards, consistent with such criteria, may be adopted by the Director, or designee. Treatment in an intensive
outpatient setting shall not be considered necessary unless the patient requires care that is more intensive than an outpatient treatment program or outpatient office visits and less intensive than inpatient psychiatric care or a partial hospital program. Intensive outpatient services will be considered necessary only if the following conditions are present:
(A) The patient is suffering significant impairment from a mental disorder, to include a substance use disorder (as defined in § 199.2), which interferes with age appropriate functioning. Patients receiving a higher intensity of treatment may be experiencing moderate to severe instability, exacerbation of severe/persistent disorder, or dangerousness with some risk of confinement. Patients receiving a lower intensity of treatment may be experiencing mild instability with limited dangerousness and low risk for confinement.
(B) The patient is unable to maintain himself or herself in the community, with appropriate support, at a sufficient level of functioning to permit an adequate course of therapy exclusively in an outpatient treatment program or an outpatient office basis (but is able, with appropriate support, to maintain a basic level of functioning to permit a level of intensive outpatient treatment and presents no substantial imminent risk of harm to self or others).
(C) The patient is in need of stabilization, symptom reduction, and prevention of relapse for chronic mental illness. The goal of maintenance of his or her functioning within the community cannot be met by outpatient office visits, but requires active treatment in a stable, staff-supported environment;
(D) The admission into the intensive outpatient program is based on the development of an individualized diagnosis and treatment plan expected to be effective for that patient and permit treatment at a less intensive level.
(iii)
Services and supplies.
The following services and supplies are included in the per diem rate approved for an authorized intensive outpatient program.
(A)
Patient assessment.
Includes the assessment of each individual accepted by the facility.
(B)
Treatment services.
All services, supplies, equipment, and space necessary to fulfill the requirements of each patient's individualized diagnosis and treatment plan. All mental health services must be provided by a TRICARE authorized individual qualified mental health provider. [Exception: Intensive outpatient programs that employ individuals with master's or doctoral level degrees in a mental health discipline who do not meet the licensure, certification, and experience requirements for a qualified mental health provider but are actively working toward licensure or certification, may provide services within the all-inclusive per diem rate but such individuals must work under the clinical supervision of a fully qualified mental health provider employed by the facility.]
(iv)
Case management.
When appropriate, and with the consent of the person served, the facility should coordinate the care, treatment, or services, including providing coordinated treatment with other services.
(v)
Professional mental health benefits.
Professional mental health benefits are billed separately from the intensive outpatient per diem rate only when rendered by an attending, TRICARE authorized qualified mental health provider who is not an employee of, or under contract with, the program for purposes of providing clinical patient care.
(vi)
Non-mental health related medical services.
Separate billing will be allowed for otherwise covered, non-mental health related medical services.
(11)
Opioid treatment programs
—(i)
In general.
Outpatient treatment and management of withdrawal symptoms for substance use disorder provided at a TRICARE authorized opioid treatment program are covered. If the patient is medically in need of management of withdrawal symptoms, but does not require the personnel or facilities of a general hospital setting, services for management of withdrawal symptoms are covered. The medical necessity for the management of withdrawal symptoms must be documented. Any services to manage withdrawal symptoms
provided by the opioid treatment program must be under general medical supervision.
(ii) Criteria for determining medical or psychological necessity of an opioid treatment program are set forth in 42 CFR part 8.
(iii)
Services and supplies.
The following services and supplies are included in the reimbursement approved for an authorized opioid treatment program.
(A)
Patient assessment.

[Exception: opioid treatment programs that employ individuals with degrees in a mental health discipline who do not meet the licensure, certification, and experience requirements for a qualified mental health provider but work under the clinical supervision of a fully qualified mental health provider employed by the facility.]
(iv)
Case management.
Care, treatment, or services should be coordinated among providers and between settings, independent of whether they are provided directly by the organization or by an organization or by an outside source, so that the individual's needs are addressed in a seamless, synchronized, and timely manner.

General.
Benefits may be extended for those covered services described in paragraph (c) of this section that are provided in accordance with good medical practice and established standards of quality by physicians or other authorized individual professional providers, as set forth in § 199.6 of this part. Such benefits are subject to all applicable definitions, conditions, exceptions, limitations, or exclusions as maybe otherwise set forth in this or other Sections of this part. Except as otherwise specifically authorized, to be considered for benefits under paragraph (c) of this section, the described services must be rendered by a physician, or prescribed, ordered, and referred medically by a physician to other authorized individual professional providers. Further, except under specifically defined circumstances, there should be an attending physician in any episode of care. (For example, certain services of a clinical psychologist are exempt from this requirement. For these exceptions, refer to § 199.6.)
(i)
Billing practices.
To be considered for benefits under paragraph (c) of this section, covered professional services must be performed personally by the physician or other authorized individual professional provider, who is other than a salaried or contractual staff member of a hospital or other authorized institution, and who ordinarily and customarily bills on a fee-for-service basis for professional services rendered. Such billings must be itemized fully and be sufficiently descriptive to permit CHAMPUS to determine whether benefits are authorized by this part. See paragraph (c)(3)(xiii) of this section for the requirements regarding the special circumstances for teaching physicians. For continuing professional care, claims should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days either by the beneficiary or sponsor, or directly by the physician or other authorized individual professional provider on behalf of a beneficiary (refer to § 199.7).

Telehealth services.
Health care services covered by TRICARE and provided through the use of telehealth modalities including telephone services for: telephonic office visits; telephonic consultations; electronic transmission of data or biotelemetry or remote physiologic monitoring services and supplies, are covered services to the same extent as if provided in person at the location of the patient if those services are medically necessary and appropriate for such modalities. The Director will establish special procedures for payment for such services. Additionally, where appropriate, in
order to incentive the use of telehealth services, the Director may modify the otherwise applicable beneficiary cost-sharing requirements in paragraph (f) of this section which otherwise apply.

Extent of professional benefits
—
(i)
Multiple Surgery.
In cases of multiple surgical procedures performed during the same operative session, benefits shall be extended as follows:
(A) One hundred (100) percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge for the major surgical procedure (the procedure for which the greatest amount is payable under the applicable reimbursement method); and
(B) Fifty (50) percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge for each of the other surgical procedures;
(C) Except that:
(
1
) If the multiple surgical procedures include an incidental procedure, no benefits shall be allowed for the incidental procedure.
(
2
) If the multiple surgical procedures involve specific procedures identified by the Director, OCHAMPUS, benefits shall be limited as set forth in CHAMPUS instructions.
(ii)
Different types of inpatient care, concurrent.
If a beneficiary receives inpatient medical care during the same admission in which he or she also receives surgical care or maternity care, the beneficiary shall be entitled to the greater of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge for either the inpatient medical care or surgical or maternity care received, as the case may
be, but not both; except that the provisions of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) shall not apply if such inpatient medical care is for a diagnosed condition requiring inpatient medical care not related to the condition for which surgical care or maternity care is received, and is received from a physician other than the one rendering the surgical care or maternity care.

# Note:
This provision is not meant to imply that when extra time and special effort are required due to postsurgical or postdelivery complications, the attending physician may not request special consideration for a higher than usual charge.
(iii)
Need for surgical assistance.
Surgical assistance is payable only when the complexity of the procedure warrants a surgical assistant (other than the surgical nurse or other such operating room personnel), subject to utilization review. In order for benefits to be extended for surgical assistance service, the primary surgeon may be required to certify in writing to the nonavailability of a qualified intern, resident, or other house physician. When a claim is received for a surgical assistant involving the following circumstances, special review is required to ascertain whether the surgical assistance service meets the medical necessity and other requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(A) If the surgical assistance occurred in a hospital that has a residency program in a specialty appropriate to the surgery;
(B) If the surgery was performed by a team of surgeons;
(C) If there were multiple surgical assistants; or
(D) If the surgical assistant was a partner of or from the same group of practicing physicians as the attending surgeon.
(iv)
Aftercare following surgery.
Except for those diagnostic procedures classified as surgery in paragraph (c) of this section, and injection and needling procedures involving the joints, the benefit payments made for surgery (regardless of the setting in which it is rendered) include normal aftercare, whether the aftercare is billed for by the physician or other authorized individual professional provider on a global, all-inclusive basis, or billed for separately.
(v)
Cast and sutures, removal.
The benefit payments made for the application of a cast or of sutures normally covers the postoperative care including the removal of the cast or sutures. When the application is made in one geographical location and the removal of the cast or sutures must be done in another geographical location, a separate benefit payment may be provided for the removal. The intent of this provision is to provide a separate benefit only when it is impracticable for the beneficiary to use the services of the provider that applied the cast originally. Benefits are not available for the services of a second provider if those services reasonably could have been rendered by the individual professional provider who applied the cast or sutures initially.
(vi)
Inpatient care, concurrent.
Concurrent inpatient care by more than one individual professional provider is covered if required because of the severity and complexity of the beneficiary's condition or because the beneficiary has multiple conditions that require treatment by providers of different specialties. Any claim for concurrent care must be reviewed before extending benefits in order to ascertain the condition of the beneficiary at the time the concurrent care was rendered. In the absence of such determination, benefits are payable only for inpatient care rendered by one attending physician or other authorized individual professional provider.
(vii)
Consultants who become the attending surgeon.
A consultation performed within 3 days of surgery by the attending physician is considered a preoperative examination. Preoperative examinations are an integral part of the surgery and a separate benefit is not payable for the consultation. If more than 3 days elapse between the consultation and surgery (performed by the same physician), benefits may be extended for the consultation, subject to review.
(viii)
Anesthesia administered by the attending physician.
A separate benefit is not payable for anesthesia administered by the attending physician (surgeon or obstetrician) or dentist, or by
the surgical, obstetrical, or dental assistant.
(ix)

(A)
Teaching physicians.
(
1
)
General.
The services of teaching physicians may be reimbursed on an allowable charge basis only when the teaching physician has established an attending physician relationship between the teaching physician and the patient or when the teaching physician provides distinct, identifiable, personal services (e.g., services rendered as a consultant, assistant surgeon, etc.). Attending physician services may include both direct patient care services or direct supervision of care provided by a physician in training. In order to be considered an attending physician, the teaching physician must:
(

(
ii
) Personally examine the patient; and
(
iiii
) Confirm or revise the diagnosis and determine the course of treatment to be followed; and
(

(
vi
) Be personally responsible for the patient's care, at least throughout the period of hospitalization.
(
2
)
Direct supervision by an attending physician of care provided by physicians
in training.
Payment on the basis of allowable charges may be made for the professional services rendered to a beneficiary by his/her attending physician when the attending physician provides personal and identifiable direction to physicians in training who are participating in the care of the patient. It is not necessary that the attending physician be personally present for all services, but the attending physician must be on the provider's premises and available to provide immediate personal assistance and direction if needed.
(
3
)
Individual, personal services.
A teaching physician may be reimbursed on an allowable charge basis for any individual, identifiable service rendered to a CHAMPUS beneficiary, so long as the service is a covered service and is normally reimbursed separately, and so long as the patient records substantiate the service.
(
4
)
Who may bill.
The services of a teaching physician must be billed by the institutional provider when the physician is employed by the provider or a related entity or under a contract which provides for payment to the physician by the provider or a related entity.

(B)
Physicians in training.
Physicians in training in an approved teaching program are considered to be “students” and may not be reimbursed directly by CHAMPUS for services rendered to a beneficiary when their services are provided as part of their employment (either salaried or contractual) by a hospital or other institutional provider.

(2)
Billing practices.
To be considered for benefits under paragraph (d) of this section, covered services and supplies must be provided and billed for by an authorized provider as set forth in § 199.6 of this part. Such billing must be itemized fully and described sufficiently, even when CHAMPUS payment is determined under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, so that CHAMPUS can determine whether benefits are authorized by this part. Except for claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, whenever continuing charges are involved, claims should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days (monthly) either by the beneficiary or sponsor or directly by the provider.

(D)
Basis for reimbursement.
(
1
) Durable equipment may be provided on a rental or purchase basis. Coverage of durable equipment will be based on the price most advantageous to the government taking into consideration the anticipated duration of the medically necessary need for the equipment and current price information for the type of item. The cost analysis must include a comparison of the total price of the item as a monthly rental charge, a lease-purchase price, and a lump-sum purchase price and a provision for the time value of money at the rate determined by the U.S. Department of Treasury. If a beneficiary wishes to obtain an item of durable equipment with deluxe, luxury, immaterial or non-essential features, the beneficiary may agree to accept TRICARE coverage limited to the allowable amount that would have otherwise been authorized for a similar item without those features. In that case, the TRICARE coverage is based upon the allowable amount for the kind of durable equipment normally used to meet the intended purpose (
i.e.,
the standard item least costly). The provider shall not hold the beneficiary liable for deluxe, luxury, immaterial, or non- essential features that cannot be considered in determining the TRICARE allowable costs. However, the beneficiary shall be held liable if the provider has a specific agreement in writing from the beneficiary (or his or her representative) accepting liability for the itemized difference in costs of the durable equipment with deluxe, luxury, or immaterial features and the TRICARE allowable costs for an otherwise authorized item without such features.
(
2
) In general, repairs of beneficiary owned durable equipment are covered when necessary to make the equipment serviceable and replacement of durable equipment is allowed when the durable equipment is not serviceable because of normal wear, accidental damage or when necessitated by a change in the beneficiary's condition. However, repairs of durable equipment damaged while using the equipment in a manner inconsistent with its common use, and replacement of lost or stolen rental durable equipment are excluded from coverage. In addition, repairs of deluxe, luxury, or immaterial features of durable equipment are excluded from coverage.
(iii)
Medical supplies and dressings (consumables)
—(A)
In general.
In general, medical supplies and dressings (consumables) are those that do not withstand prolonged, repeated use. Such items must be related directly to an appropriate and verified covered medical condition of the specific beneficiary for whom the item was purchased and obtained from a medical supply company, a pharmacy, or authorized institutional provider. Examples of covered medical supplies and dressings are disposable syringes for a known diabetic, colostomy sets, irrigation sets, and elastic bandages. An external surgical garment specifically designed for use follow a mastectomy is considered a medical supply item.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
d

# )(3)(
iii

# )(A):
Generally, the allowable charge of a medical supply item will be under $100. Any item over this amount must be reviewed to determine whether it would qualify as a DME item. If it is, in fact, a medical supply item and does not represent an excessive charge, it can be considered for benefits under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.
(B)
Medically necessary food and medical equipment and supplies necessary to administer such food (other than durable medical equipment and supplies) when prescribed for dietary management of a covered disease or condition.
(
1
) Medically necessary food, including a low protein modified food product or an amino acid preparation product, may be covered when:
(
i
) Furnished pursuant to the prescription, order, or recommendation of a TRICARE authorized provider acting within the provider's scope of license/certificate of practice, for the dietary management of a covered disease or condition;
(
ii
) Is a specifically formulated and processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring foodstuff used in its natural state) for the partial or exclusive feeding of an individual by means of oral intake or enteral feeding by tube;
(
iii
) Is intended for the dietary management of an individual who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or who has other special medically determined nutrient requirements, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone;
(
iv
) Is intended to be used under medical supervision, which may include in a home setting; and
(
v
) Is intended only for an individual receiving active and ongoing medical supervision under which the individual requires medical care on a recurring basis for, among other things, instructions on the use of the food.
(
2
) Medically necessary food does not include:
(
i
) Food taken as part of an overall diet designed to reduce the risk of a disease or medical condition or as weight-loss products, even if the food is recommended by a physician or other health care professional;
(
ii
) Food marketed as gluten-free for the management of celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity;
(
iii
) Food marketed for the management of diabetes; or
(
iv
) Such other products as the Director, Defense Health Agency determines appropriate.
(
3

(iv)
Oxygen.
Oxygen and equipment for its administration are covered. Benefits are limited to providing a tank unit at one location with oxygen limited to a 30-day supply at any one time. Repair and adjustment of CHAMPUS-purchased oxygen equipment also is covered.
(v)
Ambulance.
Civilian ambulance service is covered when medically necessary in connection with otherwise covered services and supplies and a covered medical condition. For the purpose of TRICARE payment, ambulance service is an outpatient service (including in connection with maternity care) with the exception of otherwise covered transfers between hospitals which are cost-shared on an inpatient basis. Ambulance transfers from a hospital based emergency room to another hospital more capable of providing the required care will also be cost-shared on an inpatient basis.

# Note:
The inpatient cost-sharing provisions for ambulance transfers only apply to otherwise covered transfers between hospitals, i.e., acute care, general, and special hospitals; psychiatric hospitals; and long-term hospitals.
(A) Ambulance service cannot be used instead of taxi service and is not payable when the patient's condition would have permitted use of regular private transportation; nor is it payable when transport or transfer of a patient is primarily for the purpose of having the patient nearer to home, family, friends, or personal physician. Except as described in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
) of this section transport must be to the closest appropriate facility by the least costly means.
(B) Vehicles such as medicabs or ambicabs function primarily as public passenger conveyances transporting patients to and from their medical appointments. No actual medical care is provided to the patients in transit. These types of vehicles do not qualify for benefits for the purpose of CHAMPUS payment.
(C) Except as described in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(1)(
1
) of this section, ambulance services by other than land vehicles (such as a boat or airplane) may be considered only when the pickup point is inaccessible by a land vehicle, or when great distance or other obstacles are involved in transporting the patient to the nearest hospital with appropriate facilities and the patient's medical condition warrants speedy admission or is such that transfer by other means is contraindicated.
(
1
) Advanced life support air ambulance and certified advanced life support attendant are covered services for solid organ and stem cell transplant candidates.
(
2
) Advanced life support air ambulance and certified advanced life support attendant shall be reimbursed subject to standard reimbursement methodologies.

This includes Rh immune globulin.
(A) Drugs administered by a physician or other authorized individual professional provider as an integral part of a procedure covered under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section (such as chemotherapy) are not covered under this subparagraph inasmuch as the benefit for the institutional services or the professional services in connection with the procedure itself also includes the drug used.
(B) CHAMPUS benefits may not be extended for drugs not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for commercial marketing. Drugs grandfathered by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 may be covered under CHAMPUS as if FDA approved.
(C) Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs (drugs that by United States law do not require a prescription), in general, are not covered. However, insulin is covered for a known diabetic even in states that do not require a prescription for its purchase. In addition, OTC drugs used for smoking cessation are covered when all requirements under the TRICARE smoking cessation program are met as provided in paragraph (e)(30) of this section.
(D) Medically necessary vitamins used for the management of a covered disease or condition pursuant to a prescription, order, or recommendation of a TRICARE authorized provider acting within the provider's scope of license/certificate of practice.

(
1
) Inborn errors of metabolism;
(
2
) Medical conditions of malabsorption;
(
3
) Pathologies of the alimentary tract or the gastrointestinal tract;
(
4
) A neurological or physiological condition;
(

(A) Any accessory or item of supply that is used in conjunction with the device for the purpose of achieving therapeutic benefit and proper functioning;
(B) Services necessary to train the recipient of the device in the use of the device;
(C) Repair of the device for normal wear and tear or damage;
(D) Replacement of the device if the device is lost or irreparably damaged or the cost of repair would exceed 60 percent of the cost of replacement.
(viii)
Orthopedic braces and appliances.
The purchase of leg braces (including attached shoes), arm braces, back braces, and neck braces is covered, orthopedic shoes, arch supports, shoe inserts, and other supportive devices for the feet, including special-ordered, custom-made built-up shoes or regular
shoes subsequently built up, are not covered.
(ix)
Diabetes Self-Management Training (DSMT).
A training service or program that educates diabetic patients about the successful self-management of diabetes. It includes the following criteria: Education about self-monitoring of blood glucose, diet, and exercise; an insulin treatment plan developed specifically for the patient who is insulin-dependent; and motivates the patient to use the skills for self-management. The DSMT service or program must be accredited by the American Diabetes Association.
Coverage limitations on the provision of this benefit will be as determined by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or designee.

Covered abortion services are limited to medical services and supplies only. Physician certification is required attesting that the abortion was performed because the mother's life would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. Abortions performed for suspected or confirmed fetal abnormality (e.g., anencephalic) or for mental health reasons (e.g., threatened suicide) do not fall within the exceptions permitted within the language of the statute and are not authorized for payment under CHAMPUS.

# Note:
Covered abortion services are limited to medical services or supplies only for the single circumstance outlined above and do not include abortion counseling or referral fees. Payment is not allowed for any services involving preparation for, or normal followup to, a noncovered abortion. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue guidelines describing the policy on abortion.

(
4
) If the donor is not a CHAMPUS beneficiary, TRICARE benefits for donor costs are limited to those directly related to the transplant procedure itself and do not include any medical care costs related to other treatment of the donor, including complications.
(
5
) TRICARE benefits will not be allowed for transportation of an organ donor.
(B) [Reserved]

(7) [Reserved]
(8)
Cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery.
For the purposes of CHAMPUS, cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery is surgery that can be expected primarily to improve physical appearance or that is performed primarily for psychological purposes or that restores form, but does not correct or improve materially a bodily function.

# Note:
If a surgical procedure primarily restores function, whether or not there is also a concomitant improvement in physical appearance, the surgical procedure does not fall within the provisions set forth in this paragraph (e)(8).
(i)
Limited benefits under CHAMPUS.
Benefits under the Basic Program generally are not available for cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery. However, under certain limited circumstances, benefits for otherwise covered services and supplies may be provided in connection with cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery as follows:
(A) Correction of a congenital anomaly; or
(B) Restoration of body form following an accidental injury; or

(9)
Care related to non-covered initial surgery or treatment.
(i) Benefits are available for otherwise covered services and supplies required in the treatment of complications resulting from a non-covered incident of treatment (such as nonadjunctive dental care or cosmetic surgery) but only if the later complication represents a separate medical condition such as a systemic infection, cardiac arrest, and acute drug reaction. Benefits may not be extended for any later care or a procedure related to the complication that essentially is similar to the initial non-covered care. Examples of complications similar to the initial episode of care (and thus not covered) would be repair of facial scarring resulting from dermabrasion for acne.
(ii) Benefits are available for otherwise covered services and supplies required in the treatment of complications (unfortunate sequelae) and any necessary follow-on care resulting from a non-covered incident of treatment provided in an MTF, when the initial non-covered service has been authorized by the MTF Commander and the MTF is unable to provide the necessary treatment of the complications or required follow-on care, according to the guidelines adopted by the Director, DHA, or a designee.
(iii) Benefits are available for otherwise covered services and supplies required in the treatment of complications (unfortunate sequelae) and any necessary follow-on care resulting from a non-covered incident of treatment provided in the private sector pursuant to a properly granted waiver under § 199.16(f). The Director, DHA, or designee, shall issue guidelines for implementing this provision.
(10)
Dental.
TRICARE/CHAMPUS does not include a dental benefit. However, in connection with dental treatment for patients with developmental, mental, or physical disabilities or for pediatric patients age 5 or under, only institutional and anesthesia services may be provided as a benefit. Under very limited circumstances, benefits are available for dental services and supplies when the dental services are adjunctive to otherwise covered medical treatment.
(i)
Adjunctive dental care: Limited.
Adjunctive dental care is limited to those services and supplies provided under the following conditions:
(A) Dental care which is medically necessary in the treatment of an otherwise covered medical (not dental) condition, is an integral part of the treatment of such medical condition and is essential to the control of the primary medical condition. The following is a list of conditions for which CHAMPUS benefits are payable under this provision:
(
1
) Intraoral abscesses which extend beyond the dental alveolus.
(
2
) Extraoral abscesses.
(
3
) Cellulitis and osteitis which is clearly exacerbating and directly affecting a medical condition currently under treatment.
(
4
) Removal of teeth and tooth fragments in order to treat and repair facial trauma resulting from an accidental injury.
(
5

) Adjunctive dental and orthodontic support for cleft palate.
(
8
) The prosthetic replacement of either the maxilla or the mandible due to the reduction of body tissues associated with traumatic injury (e.g., impact, gun shot wound), in addition to services related to treating neoplasms or iatrogenic dental trauma.

# Note:
The test of whether dental trauma is covered is whether the trauma is solely dental trauma. Dental trauma, in order to be covered, must be related to, and an integral part of medical trauma; or a result of medically necessary treatment of an injury or disease.
(B) Dental care required in preparation for medical treatment of a disease or disorder or required as the result of dental trauma caused by the medically necessary treatment of an injury or disease (iatrogenic).
(
1
) Necessary dental care including prophylaxis and extractions when performed in preparation for or as a result of in-line radiation therapy for oral or facial cancer.
(
2
) Treatment of gingival hyperplasia, with or without periodontal disease, as a direct result of prolonged therapy with Dilantin (diphenylhydantoin) or related compounds.
(C) Dental care is limited to the above and similar conditions specifically prescribed by the Director, OCHAMPUS, as meeting the requirements for coverage under the provisions of this section.
(ii)
General exclusions.
(A) Dental care which is routine, preventative, restorative, prosthodontic, periodontic or emergency does not qualify as adjunctive dental care for the purposes of CHAMPUS except when performed in preparation for or as a result of dental trauma caused by medically necessary treatment of an injury or disease.
(B) The adding or modifying of bridgework and dentures.
(C) Orthodontia, except when directly related to and an integral part of the medical or surgical correction of a cleft palate or when required in preparation for, or as a result of, trauma to the teeth and supporting structures caused by medically necessary treatment of an injury or disease.
(iii)
Preauthorization required.
In order to be covered, adjunctive dental care requires preauthorization from the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, in accordance with paragraph (a)(12) of this section. When adjunctive dental care involves a medical (not dental) emergency (such
as facial injuries resulting from an accident), the requirement for preauthorization is waived. Such waiver, however, is limited to the essential adjunctive dental care related to the medical condition requiring the immediate emergency treatment. A complete explanation, with supporting medical documentation, must be submitted with claims for emergency adjunctive dental care.
(iv)
Covered oral surgery.
Notwithstanding the above limitations on dental care, there are certain oral surgical procedures that are performed by both physicians and dentists, and that are essentially medical rather than dental care. For the purposes of CHAMPUS, the following procedures, whether performed by a physician or dentist, are considered to be in this category and benefits may be extended for otherwise covered services and supplies without preauthorization:
(A) Excision of tumors and cysts of the jaws, cheeks, lips, tongue, and roof and floor of the mouth, when such conditions require a pathological (histological) examination.
(B) Surgical procedures required to correct accidental injuries of the jaws, cheeks, lips, tongue, and roof and floor of the mouth.
(C) Treatment of oral or facial cancer.
(D) Treatment of fractures of facial bones.
(E) External (extra-oral) incision and drainage of cellulitis.
(F) Surgery of accessory sinuses, salivary glands, or ducts.
(G) Reduction of dislocations and the excision of the temporomandibular joints, when surgery is a necessary part of the reduction.
(H) Any oral surgical procedure that falls within the cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery definition is subject to the limitations and requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(8) of this section.

# Note:
Extraction of unerupted or partially erupted, malposed or impacted teeth, with or without the attached follicular or development tissues, is not a covered oral surgery procedure except when the care is indicated in preparation for medical treatment of a disease or disorder or required as a result of dental trauma caused by the necessary medical treatment of an injury or illness. Surgical preparation of the mouth for dentures is not covered by CHAMPUS.
(v)
Inpatient hospital stay in connection with non-adjunctive, noncovered dental care.
Institutional benefits specified in paragraph (b) of this section may be extended for inpatient hospital stays related to noncovered, nonadjunctive dental care when such inpatient stay is medically necessary to safeguard the life of the patient from the effects of dentistry because of the existence of a specific and serious nondental organic impairment currently under active treatment. (Hemophilia is an example of a condition that could be considered a serious nondental impairment.) Preauthorization by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is required for such inpatient stays to be covered in the same manner as required for adjunctive dental care described in paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section. Regardless of whether or not the preauthorization request for the hospital admission is approved and thus qualifies for institutional benefits, the professional service related to the nonadjunctive dental care is not covered.
(vi)
Anesthesia and institutional costs for dental care for children and certain other patients.
Institutional benefits specified in paragraph (b) of this section may be extended for hospital and in-out surgery settings related to noncovered, nonadjunctive dental care when such outpatient care or inpatient stay is in conjunction with dental treatment for patients with developmental, mental, or physical disabilities or for pediatric patients age 5 or under. For these patients, anesthesia services will be limited to the administration of general anesthesia only. Patients with developmental, mental, or physical disabilities are those patients with conditions that prohibit dental treatment in a safe and effective manner. Therefore, it is medically or psychologically necessary for these patients to require general anesthesia for dental treatment. Patients with physical disabilities include those patients having disabilities as defined in § 199.2 as a serious physical disability. Preauthorization by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a
designee, is required for such outpatient care or inpatient stays to be covered in the same manner as required for adjunctive dental care described in paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section. Regardless of whether or not the preauthorization request for outpatient care or hospital admission is approved and thus qualifies for institutional benefits, the professional service related to the nonadjunctive dental care is not covered, with the exception of coverage for anesthesia services.
(11)
Drug abuse.
Under the Basic Program, benefits may be extended for medically necessary prescription drugs required in the treatment of an illness or injury or in connection with maternity care (refer to paragraph (d) of this section). However, TRICARE benefits cannot be authorized to support or maintain an existing or potential drug abuse situation whether or not the drugs (under other circumstances) are eligible for benefit consideration and whether or not obtained by legal means. Drugs, including the substitution of a therapeutic drug with addictive potential for a drug of addiction, prescribed to beneficiaries undergoing medically supervised treatment for a substance use disorder as authorized under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are not considered to be in support of, or to maintain, an existing or potential drug abuse situation and are allowed. The Director may prescribe appropriate policies to implement this prescription drug benefit for those undergoing medically supervised treatment for a substance use disorder.
(i)
Limitations on who can prescribe drugs.
CHAMPUS benefits are not available for any drugs prescribed by a member of the beneficiary's family or by a nonfamily member residing in the same household with the beneficiary or sponsor.
(ii) [Reserved]
(iii)
Kinds of prescription drugs that are monitored carefully by CHAMPUS for possible abuse situations
—(A)
Narcotics.
Examples are Morphine and Demerol.
(B)
Nonnarcotic analgesics.
Examples are Talwin and Darvon.
(C)
Tranquilizers.
Examples are Valium, Librium, and Meprobamate.
(D)
Barbiturates.
Examples are Seconal and Nembuttal.
(E)
Nonbarbituate hypnotics.
Examples are Doriden and Chloral Hydrate.
(F)
Stimulants.
Examples are amphetamines.
(iv)
CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary responsibilities.
CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries are responsible for implementing utilization control and quality assurance procedures designed to identify possible drug abuse situations. The CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary is directed to screen all drug claims for potential overutilization and irrational prescribing of drugs, and to subject any such cases to extensive review to establish the necessity for the drugs and their appropriateness on the basis of diagnosis or definitive symptoms.
(A) When a possible drug abuse situation is identified, all claims for drugs for that specific beneficiary or provider will be suspended pending the results of a review.
(B) If the review determines that a drug abuse situation does in fact exist, all drug claims held in suspense will be denied.
(C) If the record indicates previously paid drug benefits, the prior claims for that beneficiary or provider will be reopened and the circumstances involved reviewed to determine whether or not drug abuse also existed at the time the earlier claims were adjudicated. If drug abuse is later ascertained, benefit payments made previously will be considered to have been extended in error and the amounts so paid recouped.
(D) Inpatient stays primarily for the purpose of obtaining drugs and any other services and supplies related to drug abuse also are excluded.
(v)
Unethical or illegal provider practices related to drugs.
Any such investigation into a possible drug abuse that uncovers unethical or illegal drug dispensing practices on the part of an institution, a pharmacy, or physician will be referred to the professional or investigative agency having jurisdiction. CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries are directed to withhold payment of all CHAMPUS claims for services and supplies rendered by a provider under active investigation for possible unethical or illegal drug dispensing activities.
(vi)
Detoxification.
The above monitoring and control of drug abuse situations shall in no way be construed to deny otherwise covered medical services and supplies related to drug detoxification (including newborn, addicted infants) when medical supervision is required.
(12) [Reserved]
(13)
Domiciliary care.
The statute under which CHAMPUS operates also specifically excludes domiciliary care (refer to § 199.2 of this part for the definition of “Domiciliary Care”).
(i)
Examples of domiciliary care situations.
The following are examples of domiciliary care for which CHAMPUS benefits are not payable.
(A)
Home care is not available.
Institutionalization primarily because parents work, or extension of a hospital stay beyond what is medically necessary because the patient lives alone, are examples of domiciliary care provided because there is no other family member or other person available in the home.
(B)
Home care is not suitable.
Institutionalization of a child because a parent (or parents) is unable to provide a safe and nurturing environment due to a mental or substance use disorder, or because someone in the home has a contagious disease, are examples of why domiciliary care is being provided because the home setting is unsuitable.
(C)
Family unwilling to care for a person in the home.
A child who is difficult to manage may be placed in an institution, not because institutional care is medically necessary, but because the family does not want to handle him or her in the home. Such institutionalization would represent domiciliary care, that is, the family being unwilling to assume responsibility for the child.
(ii)
Benefits available in connection with a domiciliary care case.
Should the beneficiary receive otherwise covered medical services or supplies while also being in a domiciliary care situation, CHAMPUS benefits are payable for those medical services or supplies, or both, in the same manner as though the beneficiary resided in his or her own home. Such benefits would be cost-shared as though rendered to an outpatient.
(iii)
General exclusion.
Domiciliary care is institutionalization essentially to provide a substitute home—not because it is medically necessary for the beneficiary to be in the institution (although there may be conditions present that have contributed to the fact that domiciliary care is being rendered). CHAMPUS benefits are not payable for any costs or charges related to the provision of domiciliary care. While a substitute home or assistance may be necessary for the beneficiary, domiciliary care does not represent the kind of care for which CHAMPUS benefits can be provided.
(14)
CT scanning
—(i)
Approved CT scan services.
Benefits may be extended for medically necessary CT scans of the head or other anatomical regions of the body when all of the following conditions are met:
(A) The patient is referred for the diagnostic procedure by a physician.
(B) The CT scan procedure is consistent with the preliminary diagnosis or symptoms.
(C) Other noninvasive and less costly means of diagnosis have been attempted or are not appropriate.
(D) The CT scan equipment is licensed or registered by the appropriate state agency responsible for licensing or registering medical equipment that emits ionizing radiation.
(E) The CT scan equipment is operated under the general supervision and direction of a physician.
(F) The results of the CT scan diagnostic procedure are interpreted by a physician.
(ii)
Review guidelines and criteria.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will issue specific guidelines and criteria for CHAMPUS coverage of medically necessary head and body part CT scans.
(15)
Morbid obesity.
The TRICARE morbid obesity benefit is limited to those bariatric surgical procedures for which the safety and efficacy has been proven comparable or superior to conventional therapies and is consistent with the generally accepted norms for medical practice in the United States medical community. (See the definition of
reliable evidence
in § 199.2 of this
part for the procedures used in determining if a medical treatment or procedure is unproven.)
(i)
Conditions for coverage.
(A) Payment for bariatric surgical procedures is determined by the requirements specified in paragraph (g)(15) of this section, and as defined in § 199.2(b) of this part.
(B) Covered bariatric surgical procedures are payable only when the patient has completed growth (18 years of age or documentation of completion of bone growth) and has met one of the following selection criteria:
(
1
) The patient has a BMI that is equal to or exceeds 40 kg/m
2
and has previously been unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity.
(
2
) The patient has a BMI of 35 to 39.9 kg/m
2
, has at least one high-risk co-morbid condition associated with morbid obesity, and has previously been unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity.

# Note:
The Director, TMA, shall issue guidelines for review of the specific high-risk co-morbid conditions, exacerbated or caused by obesity based on the Reliable Evidence Standard as defined in § 199.2 of this part.
(ii)
Treatment of complications.
(A) Payment may be extended for repeat bariatric surgery when medically necessary to correct or treat complications from the initial covered bariatric surgery (a takedown). For instance, the surgeon in many cases will do a gastric bypass or gastroplasty to help the patient avoid regaining the weight that was lost. In this situation, payment is authorized even though the patient's condition technically may not meet the definition of morbid obesity because of the weight that was already lost following the initial surgery.
(B) Payment is authorized for otherwise covered medical services and supplies directly related to complications of obesity when such services and supplies are an integral and necessary part of the course of treatment that was aggravated by the obesity.
(iii)
Exclusions.
CHAMPUS payment may not be extended for weight control services, weight control/loss programs, dietary regimens and supplements, appetite suppressants and other medications; food or food supplements, exercise and exercise programs, or other programs and equipment that are primarily intended to control weight or for the purpose of weight reduction, regardless of the existence of co-morbid conditions.
(16)
Maternity care.
(i)
Benefit.
The CHAMPUS Basic Program may share the cost of medically necessary services and supplies associated with maternity care which are not otherwise excluded by this part.
(ii)
Cost-share.
Maternity care cost-share shall be determined as follows:
(A) Inpatient cost-share formula applies to maternity care ending in childbirth in, or on the way to, a hospital inpatient childbirth unit, and for maternity care ending in a non-birth outcome not otherwise excluded by this part.
(B) Ambulatory surgery cost-share formula applies to maternity care ending in childbirth in, or on the way to, a birthing center to which the beneficiary is admitted and from which the beneficiary has received prenatal care, or a hospital-based outpatient birthing room.
(C) Outpatient cost-share formula applies to maternity care which terminates in a planned childbirth at home.
(D) Otherwise covered medical services and supplies directly related to “Complications of pregnancy,” as defined in § 199.2 of this part, will be cost-shared on the same basis as the related maternity care for a period not to exceed 42 days following termination of the pregnancy and thereafter cost-shared on the basis of the inpatient or outpatient status of the beneficiary when medically necessary services and supplies are received.
(17)
Biofeedback Therapy.
Biofeedback therapy is a technique by which a person is taught to exercise control over a physiologic process occurring within the body. By using modern biomedical instruments the patient learns how a specific physiologic system within his body operates and how to modify the performance of this particular system.
(i)
Benefits Provided.
CHAMPUS benefits are payable for services and supplies in connection with electrothermal, electromyograph and electrodermal biofeedback therapy when there is documentation that the patient has undergone an appropriate
medical evaluation, that their present condition is not responding to or no longer responds to other forms of conventional treatment, and only when provided as treatment for the following conditions:
(A) Adjunctive treatment for Raynaud's Syndrome.
(B) Adjunctive treatment for muscle re-education of specific muscle groups or for treating pathological muscle abnormalities of spasticity, or incapacitating muscle spasm or weakness.
(ii)
Limitations.
Payable benefits include initial intake evaluation. Treatment following the initial intake evaluation is limited to a maximum of 20 inpatient and outpatient biofeedback treatments per calendar year.
(iii)
Exclusions.
Benefits are excluded for biofeedback therapy for the treatment of ordinary muscle tension states or for psychosomatic conditions. Benefits are also excluded for the rental or purchase of biofeedback equipment.
(iv)
Provider Requirements.
A provider of biofeedback therapy must be a CHAMPUS-authorized provider. (Refer to § 199.6, “Authorized Providers). If biofeedback treatment is provided by other than a physician, the patient must be referred by a physician.
(v)
Implementation Guidelines.
The Director of OCHAMPUS shall issue guidelines as are necessary to implement the provision of this paragraph.
(18)
Cardiac rehabilitation.
Cardiac rehabilitation is the process by which individuals are restored to their optimal physical, medical, and psychological status, after a cardiac event. Cardiac rehabilitation is often divided into three phases. Phase I begins during inpatient hospitalization and is managed by the patient's personal physician. Phase II is a medically supervised outpatient program which begins following discharge. Phase III is a lifetime maintenance program emphasizing continuation of physical fitness with periodic followup. Each phase includes an exercise component, patient education, and risk factor modification. There may be considerable variation in program components, intensity, and duration.
(i)
Benefits Provided.
CHAMPUS benefits are available on an inpatient or outpatient basis for services and supplies provided in connection with a cardiac rehabilitation program when ordered by a physician and provided as treatment for patients who have experienced the following cardiac events within the preceding twelve (12) months:
(A) Myocardial Infarction.
(B) Coronary Artery Bypass Graft.
(C) Coronary Angioplasty.
(D) Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty
(E) Chronic Stable Angina (see limitations below).
(F) Heart valve surgery.
(G) Heart or Heart-lung Transplantation.
(ii)
Limitations.
Payable benefits include separate allowance for the initial evaluation and testing. Outpatient treatment following the initial intake evaluation and testing is limited to a maximum of thirty-six (36) sessions per cardiac event, usually provided 3 sessions per week for twelve (12) weeks. Patients diagnosed with chronic stable angina are limited to one treatment episode (36 sessions) in a calendar year.
(iii)
Exclusions.
Phase III cardiac rehabilitation lifetime maintenance programs performed at home or in medically unsupervised settings are not covered.
(iv)
Providers.
A provider of cardiac rehabilitation services must be a TRICARE authorized hospital (see § 199.6 (b)(4)(i)) or a freestanding cardiac rehabilitation facility that meets the requirements of § 199.6 (f). All cardiac rehabilitation services must be ordered by a physician.
(v)
Payment.
Payment for outpatient treatment will be based on an all inclusive allowable charge per session. Inpatient treatment will be paid based upon the reimbursement system in place for the hospital where the services are rendered.
(vi)
Implementation Guidelines.
The Director of OCHAMPUS shall issue guidelines as are necessary to implement the provisions of this paragraph.
(19)
Hospice care.
Hospice care is a program which provides an integrated set of services and supplies designed to care for the terminally ill. This type of care emphasizes palliative care and supportive services, such as pain control and home care, rather than cure-
oriented services provided in institutions that are otherwise the primary focus under CHAMPUS. The benefit provides coverage for a humane and sensible approach to care during the last days of life for some terminally ill patients.
(i)
Benefit coverage.
CHAMPUS beneficiaries who are terminally ill (that is, a life expectancy of six months or less if the disease runs its normal course) will be eligible for the following services and supplies in lieu of most other CHAMPUS benefits:
(A) Physician services.
(B) Nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a registered professional nurse.
(C) Medical social services provided by a social worker who has at least a bachelor's degree from a school accredited or approved by the Council on Social Work Education, and who is working under the direction of a physician. Medical social services include, but are not limited to the following:
(
1
) Assessment of social and emotional factors related to the beneficiary's illness, need for care, response to treatment, and adjustment to care.
(
2
) Assessment of the relationship of the beneficiary's medical and nursing requirements to the individual's home situation, financial resources, and availability of community resources.
(
3
) Appropriate action to obtain available community resources to assist in resolving the beneficiary's problem.
(
4
) Counseling services that are required by the beneficiary.
(D) Counseling services provided to the terminally ill individual and the family member or other persons caring for the individual at home. Counseling, including dietary counseling, may be provided both for the purpose of training the individual's family or other care-giver to provide care, and for the purpose of helping the individual and those caring for him or her to adjust to the individual's approaching death. Bereavement counseling, which consists of counseling services provided to the individual's family after the individual's death, is a required hospice service but it is not reimbursable.
(E) Home health aide services furnished by qualified aides and homemaker services. Home health aides may provide personal care services. Aides also may perform household services to maintain a safe and sanitary environment in areas of the home used by the patient. Examples of such services are changing the bed or light cleaning and laundering essential to the comfort and cleanliness of the patient. Aide services must be provided under the general supervision of a registered nurse. Homemaker services may include assistance in personal care, maintenance of a safe and healthy environment, and services to enable the individual to carry out the plan of care. Qualifications for home health aides can be found in 42 CFR 484.36.
(F) Medical appliances and supplies, including drugs and biologicals. Only drugs that are used primarily for the relief of pain and symptom control related to the individual's terminal illness are covered. Appliances may include covered durable medical equipment, as well as other self-help and personal comfort items related to the palliation or management of the patient's condition while he or she is under hospice care. Equipment is provided by the hospice for use in the beneficiary's home while he or she is under hospice care. Medical supplies include those that are part of the written plan of care. Medical appliances and supplies are included within the hospice all-inclusive rates.
(G) Physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech-language pathology services provided for purposes of symptom control or to enable the individual to maintain activities of daily living and basic functional skills.
(H) Short-term inpatient care provided in a Medicare participating hospice inpatient unit, or a Medicare participating hospital, skilled nursing facility (SNF) or, in the case of respite care, a Medicaid-certified nursing facility that additionally meets the special hospice standards regarding staffing and patient areas. Services provided in an inpatient setting must conform to the written plan of care. Inpatient care may be required for procedures necessary for pain control or acute or
chronic symptom management. Inpatient care may also be furnished to provide respite for the individual's family or other persons caring for the individual at home. Respite care is the only type of inpatient care that may be provided in a Medicaid-certified nursing facility. The limitations on custodial care and personal comfort items applicable to other CHAMPUS services are not applicable to hospice care.
(ii)
Core services.
The hospice must ensure that substantially all core services are routinely provided directly by hospice employees; i.e., physician services, nursing care, medical social services, and counseling for individuals and care givers. Refer to paragraphs (e)(19)(i)(A), (e)(19)(i)(B), (e)(19)(i)(C), and (e)(19)(i)(D) of this section.
(iii)
Non-core services.
While non-core services (i.e., home health aide services, medical appliances and supplies, drugs and biologicals, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology and short-term inpatient care) may be provided under arrangements with other agencies or organizations, the hospice must maintain professional management of the patient at all times and in all settings. Refer to paragraphs (e)(19)(i)(E), (e)(19)(i)(F), (e)(19)(i)(G), and (e)(19)(i)(H) of this section.
(iv)
Availability of services.
The hospice must make nursing services, physician services, and drugs and biologicals routinely available on a 24-hour basis. All other covered services must be made available on a 24-hour basis to the extent necessary to meet the needs of individuals for care that is reasonable and necessary for the palliation and management of the terminal illness and related condition. These services must be provided in a manner consistent with accepted standards of practice.
(v)
Periods of care.
Hospice care is divided into distinct periods of care. The periods of care that may be elected by the terminally ill CHAMPUS beneficiary shall be as the Director, TRICARE determines to be appropriate, but shall not be less than those offered under Medicare's Hospice Program.
(vi)
Conditions for coverage.
The CHAMPUS beneficiary must meet the following conditions/criteria in order to be eligible for the hospice benefits and services referenced in paragraph (e)(19)(i) of this section.
(A) There must be written certification in the medical record that the CHAMPUS beneficiary is terminally ill with a life expectancy of six months or less if the terminal illness runs its normal course.
(
1
)
Timing of certification.
The hospice must obtain written certification of terminal illness for each of the election periods described in paragraph (e)(19(vi)(B) of this section, even if a single election continues in effect for two, three or four periods.
(
i
)
Basic requirement.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(19(vi)(A)(
1
)(

(B) The terminally ill beneficiary must elect to receive hospice care for each specified period of time; i.e., the two 90-day periods, a subsequent 30-day period, and a final period of unlimited duration. If the individual is found to be mentally incompetent, his or her representative may file the election statement. Representative means an
individual who has been authorized under State law to terminate medical care or to elect or revoke the election of hospice care on behalf of a terminally ill individual who is found to be mentally incompetent.
(
1
) The episodes of care must be used consecutively; i.e., the two 90-day periods first, then the 30-day period, followed by the final period. The periods of care may be elected separately at different times.
(
2
) The initial election will continue through subsequent election periods without a break in care as long as the individual remains in the care of the hospice and does not revoke the election.
(
3
) The effective date of the election may begin on the first day of hospice care or any subsequent day of care, but the effective date cannot be made prior to the date that the election was made.
(
4
) The beneficiary or representative may revoke a hospice election at any time, but in doing so, the remaining days of that particular election period are forfeited and standard CHAMPUS coverage resumes. To revoke the hospice benefit, the beneficiary or representative must file a signed statement of revocation with the hospice. The statement must provide the date that the revocation is to be effective. An individual or representative may not designate an effective date earlier than the date that the revocation is made.
(
5
) If an election of hospice benefits has been revoked, the individual, or his or her representative may at any time file a hospice election for any period of time still available to the individual, in accordance with § 199.4(e)(19)(vi)(B).
(
6
) A CHAMPUS beneficiary may change, once in each election period, the designation of the particular hospice from which he or she elects to receive hospice care. To change the designation of hospice programs the individual or representative must file, with the hospice from which care has been received and with the newly designated hospice, a statement that includes the following information:
(
i
) The name of the hospice from which the individual has received care and the name of the hospice from which he or she plans to receive care.
(
ii
) The date the change is to be effective.
(
7
) Each hospice will design and print its own election statement to include the following information:
(
i
) Identification of the particular hospice that will provide care to the individual.
(
ii
) The individual's or representative's acknowledgment that he or she has been given a full understanding of the palliative rather than curative nature of hospice care, as it relates to the individual's terminal illness.
(
iii
) The individual's or representative's acknowledgment that he or she understands that certain other CHAMPUS services are waived by the election.
(
iv
) The effective date of the election.

(
1
) Care provided by any hospice program other than the elected hospice unless provided under arrangements made by the elected hospice; and
(
2
) Other CHAMPUS basic program services/benefits related to the treatment of the terminal illness for which hospice care was elected, or to a related condition, or that are equivalent to hospice care, except for services provided by:
(
i
) The designated hospice;
(
ii
) Another hospice under arrangement made by the designated hospice; or
(
iii
) An attending physician who is not employed by or under contract with the hospice program.
(
3
) Basic CHAMPUS coverage will be reinstated upon revocation of the hospice election.
(D) A written plan of care must be established by a member of the basic interdisciplinary group assessing the patient's needs. This group must have at least one physician, one registered professional nurse, one social worker, and one pastoral or other counselor.
(
1
) In establishing the initial plan of care the member of the basic interdisciplinary group who assesses the patient's needs must meet or call at least one other group member before writing the initial plan of care.
(
2
) At least one of the persons involved in developing the initial plan must be a nurse or physician.
(
3
) The plan must be established on the same day as the assessment if the day of assessment is to be a covered day of hospice care.
(
4
) The other two members of the basic interdisciplinary group—the attending physician and the medical director or physician designee—must review the initial plan of care and provide their input to the process of establishing the plan of care within two calendar days following the day of assessment. A meeting of group members is not required within this 2-day period. Input may be provided by telephone.
(
5
) Hospice services must be consistent with the plan of care for coverage to be extended.
(
6
) The plan must be reviewed and updated, at intervals specified in the plan, by the attending physician, medical director or physician designee and interdisciplinary group. These reviews must be documented in the medical records.
(
7
) The hospice must designate a registered nurse to coordinate the implementation of the plan of care for each patient.
(
8
) The plan must include an assessment of the individual's needs and identification of the services, including the management of discomfort and symptom relief. It must state in detail the scope and frequency of services needed to meet the patient's and family's needs.
(E) Complete medical records and all supporting documentation must be submitted to the CHAMPUS contractor within 30 days of the date of its request. If records are not received within the designated time frame, authorization of the hospice benefit will be denied and any prior payments made will be recouped. A denial issued for this reason is not an initial determination under § 199.10, and is not appealable.
(vii)
Appeal rights under hospice benefit.
A beneficiary or provider is entitled to appeal rights for cases involving a denial of benefits in accordance with the provisions of this part and § 199.10.
(20) [Reserved]

By law, and pursuant to an agreement between the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services, the general prohibition against CHAMPUS cost-sharing of unproven drugs, devices, and medical treatments or procedures may be
waived by the Secretary of Defense in connection with clinical trials sponsored or approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or an NIH Institute or Center if it is determined that such a waiver will promote access by covered beneficiaries to promising new treatments and contribute to the development of such treatments. A waiver shall only be exercised as authorized under this paragraph.
(i)
Demonstration waiver.
A waiver may be granted through a demonstration project established in accordance with Sec. 199.1(o) of this part.
(ii)
Continuous waiver.
(A)
General.
As a result of a demonstration project under which a waiver has been granted in connection with a National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute clinical trial, a determination may be made that it is in the best interest of the government and CHAMPUS beneficiaries to end the demonstration and continue to provide a waiver for CHAMPUS cost-sharing of the specific clinical trial. Only those specified clinical trials identified under paragraph (e)(26)(ii) of this section have been authorized a continuous waiver under CHAMPUS.
(B)
National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored cancer prevention, screening, and early detection clinical trials.
A continuous waiver under paragraph (e)(26) of this regulation has been granted for CHAMPUS cost-sharing for those CHAMPUS-eligible patients selected to participate in NCI sponsored Phase II and Phase III studies for the prevention and treatment of cancer. Additionally, Phase I studies may be approved on a case by case basis when the requirements below are met.

(30)
Smoking cessation program.
The TRICARE smoking cessation program is a behavioral modification program to assist eligible beneficiaries who desire to quit smoking. The program consists of a pharmaceutical benefit; smoking cessation counseling; access to a toll-free quit line for non-medical assistance; and, access to print and internet web-based tobacco cessation materials.
(i)
Availability.
The TRICARE smoking cessation program is available to all TRICARE beneficiaries who reside in one of the 50 United States or the District of Columbia who are not eligible for Medicare benefits authorized under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. In addition, pursuant to § 199.17, if authorized by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), the TRICARE smoking cessation program may be implemented in whole or in part in areas outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia for active duty members and their dependents who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime (overseas Prime beneficiaries). In such cases, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may also authorize modifications to the TRICARE smoking cessation program rules and procedures as may be appropriate to the overseas area involved. Notice of the use of this authority, not otherwise mentioned in this paragraph (e)(30), shall be published in the
Federal Register.
(ii)
Benefits.
There is no requirement for an eligible beneficiary to be diagnosed with a smoking related illness to access benefits under this program. The specific benefits available under the TRICARE smoking cessation program are:
(A)
Pharmaceutical agents.
Products available under this program are identified through the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, consistent with the DoD Uniform Formulary in § 199.21. Smoking cessation pharmaceutical agents, including FDA-approved over-the-counter (OTC) pharmaceutical agents, are available through the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP) or the MTF at no cost to the beneficiary. Smoking cessation pharmaceuticals through the TRICARE program will not be available at any retail pharmacies. A prescription from
a TRICARE-authorized provider is required to obtain any pharmaceutical agent used for smoking cessation, including OTC agents. For overseas Prime beneficiaries, pharmaceutical agents may be provided either in the MTF or through the TMOP where such facility or service is available.
(B)
Face-to-face smoking cessation counseling.
Both individual and group smoking cessation counseling are covered. The number and mix of face-to-face counseling sessions covered under this program shall be determined by the Director, TMA; however, shall not exceed the limits established in paragraph (e)(30)(iii) of this section. A TRICARE-authorized provider listed in § 199.6 must render all counseling sessions.
(C)
Toll-free quit line.
Access to a non-medical toll-free quit line 7 days a week, 24 hours a day will be available. The quit line will be staffed with smoking cessation counselors trained to assess a beneficiary's readiness to quit, identify barriers to quitting, and provide specific suggested actions and motivational counseling to enhance the chances of a successful quit attempt. When appropriate, quit line counselors will refer beneficiaries to a TRICARE-authorized provider for medical intervention. The quit line may, at the discretion of the Director, TMA, include the opportunity for the beneficiary to request individual follow-up contact initiated by quit line personnel; however, the beneficiary is not required to participate in the quit line initiated follow-up. Printed educational materials on the effects of tobacco use will be provided to the beneficiary upon request. This benefit may be made available to overseas Prime beneficiaries should the ASD(HA) exercise his authority to do so and provide appropriate notice in the
Federal Register.
(D)
Web-based resources.
Downloadable educational materials on the effects of tobacco use will be available through the internet or other electronic media. This service may be made available to overseas Prime beneficiaries in all locations where web based resources are available. There shall be no requirement to create web based resources in any geographic area in order to make this service available.
(f)
Beneficiary or sponsor liability
—(1)
General.
As stated in the introductory paragraph to this section, the Basic Program is essentially a supplemental program to the Uniformed Services direct medical care system. To encourage use of the Uniformed Services direct medical care system wherever its facilities are available and appropriate, the Basic Program benefits are designed so that it is to the financial advantage of a CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor to use the direct medical care system. When medical care is received from civilian sources, a CHAMPUS beneficiary is responsible for payment of certain deductible and cost-sharing amounts in connection with otherwise covered services and supplies. By statute, this joint financial responsibility between the beneficiary or sponsor and CHAMPUS is more favorable for dependents of members than for other classes of beneficiaries.
(2)
Dependents of members of the Uniformed Services.
CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor liability set forth for dependents of members is as follows:
(i)
Annual calendar year deductible for outpatient services and supplies.
(A) For care rendered all eligible beneficiaries prior to April 1, 1991, or when the active duty sponsor's pay grade is E-4 or below, regardless of the date of care:
(
1
)
Individual Deductible:
Each beneficiary is liable for the first fifty dollars ($50.00) of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable amount on claims for care provided in the same calendar year.
(
2
)
Family Deductible:
The total deductible amount for all members of a family with the same sponsor during one calendar year shall not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00).
(B) For care rendered on or after April 1, 1991, for all CHAMPUS beneficiaries except dependents of active duty sponsors in pay grades E-4 or below.
(
1) Individual Deductible:
Each beneficiary is liable for the first one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable amount on claims for care provided in the same calendar year.
(
2) Family Deductible:
The total deductible amount for all members of a
family with the same sponsor during one calendar year shall not exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00).
(C) CHAMPUS-
approved Ambulatory Surgical Centers or Birthing Centers.
No deductible shall be applied to allowable amounts for services or items rendered to active duty for authorized NATO dependents.
(D)
Allowable Amount does not exceed Deductible Amount.
If calendar year allowable amounts for two or more beneficiary members of a family total less than $100.00 ($300.00 if paragraph (f) (2)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section applies), but more of the beneficiary members submit a claim for over $50.00 ($150.00 if paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section applies), neither the family nor the individual deductible will have been met and no CHAMPUS benefits are payable.
(E) For any family the outpatient deductible amounts will be applied sequentially as the CHAMPUS claims are processed.
(F) If the calendar year outpatient deductible under either paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A) or (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section has been met by a beneficiary or a family through the submission of a claim or claims to a CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary in another geographic location from the location where a current claim is being submitted, the beneficiary or sponsor must obtain a deductible certificate from the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary where the applicable beneficiary or family calendar year deductible was met. Such deductible certificate must be attached to the current claim being submitted for benefits. Failure to obtain a deductible certificate under such circumstances will result in a second beneficiary or family calendar year deductible being applied. However, this second deductible may be reimbursed once appropriate documentation, as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(F) of this section, is supplied to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary applying the second deductible.
(G) Notwithstanding the dates specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A) and (f)(B)(2)(i) of this section in the case of dependents of active duty members of rank E-5 or above with Persian Gulf Conflict service, dependents of service members who were killed in the Gulf, or who died subsequent to Gulf service, and of members who retired prior to October 1, 1991, after having served in the Gulf War, the deductible shall be the amount specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section for care rendered prior to October 1, 1991, and the amount specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section for care rendered on or after October 1, 1991.
(H) The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, may waive the annual individual or family calendar year deductible for dependents of a Reserve Component member who is called or ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days or a National Guard member who is called or ordered to fulltime federal National Guard duty for a period of more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation (as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)). For purposes of this paragraph, a dependent is a lawful husband or wife of the member and a child is defined in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) through (F) and (b)(2)(ii)(H)(1), (2), and (4) of § 199.3.
(ii)
Inpatient cost-sharing.
Dependents of members of the Uniformed Services are responsible for the payment of the first $25 of the allowable institutional costs incurred with each covered inpatient admission to a hospital or other authorized institutional provider (refer to § 199.6, including inpatient admission to a residential treatment center, substance use disorder rehabilitation facility residential treatment program, or skilled nursing facility), or the amount the beneficiary or sponsor would have been charged had the inpatient care been provided in a Uniformed Service hospital, whichever is greater.
Note:
The Secretary of Defense (after consulting with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Transportation) prescribes the fair charges for inpatient hospital care provided through Uniformed Services medical facilities. This determination is made each calendar year.
(A)
Inpatient cost-sharing payable with each separate inpatient admission.
A separate cost-sharing amount (as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) is payable for each inpatient admission to a hospital or other authorized institution, regardless of the purpose of the admission (such as medical
or surgical), regardless of the number of times the beneficiary is admitted, and regardless of whether or not the inpatient admissions are for the same or related conditions; except that successive inpatient admissions shall be deemed one inpatient confinement for the purpose of computing the inpatient cost-share payable, provided not more than 60 days have elapsed between the successive admissions. However, notwithstanding this provision, all admissions related to a single maternity episode shall be considered one confinement, regardless of the number of days between admissions (refer to paragraph (b) of this section).
(B)
Multiple family inpatient admissions.
A separate cost-sharing amount is payable for each inpatient admission, regardless of whether or not two or more beneficiary members of a family are admitted at the same time or from the same cause (such as an accident). A separate beneficiary inpatient cost-sharing amount must be applied for each separate admission on each beneficiary member of the family.
(C)
Newborn patient in his or her own right.
When a newborn infant remains as an inpatient in his or her own right (usually after the mother is discharged), the newborn child becomes the beneficiary and patient and the extended inpatient stay becomes a separate inpatient admission. In such a situation, a new, separate inpatient cost-sharing amount is applied. If a multiple birth is involved (such as twins or triplets) and two or more newborn infants become patients in their own right, a separate inpatient cost-sharing amount must be applied to the inpatient stay for each newborn child who has remained as an inpatient in his or her own right.
(iii)
Outpatient cost-sharing.
Dependents of members of the Uniformed Services are responsible for payment of 20 percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost or charge beyond the annual calendar year deductible amount (as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section) for otherwise covered services or supplies provided on an outpatient basis by authorized providers.
(iv)
Ambulatory surgery.
Notwithstanding the above provisions pertaining to outpatient cost-sharing, dependents of members of the Uniformed Services are responsible for payment of $25 for surgical care that is authorized and received while in an outpatient status and that has been designated in guidelines issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(v) [Reserved]
(vi)
Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP).
Members of the Armed Forces (and their family members) who are eligible for TAMP under paragraph 199.3(e) of this Part are subject to the same beneficiary or sponsor liability as family members of members of the uniformed services described in this paragraph (f)(2).
(3)
Former members and dependents of former members.
CHAMPUS beneficiary liability set forth for former members and dependents of former members is as follows:
(i)
Annual calendar year deductible for outpatient services or supplies.
The annual calendar year deductible for otherwise covered outpatient services or supplies provided former members and dependents of former members is the same as the annual calendar year outpatient deductible applicable to dependents of active duty members of rank E-5 or above (refer to paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section).
(ii)
Inpatient cost-sharing.
Inpatient admissions to a hospital or other authorized institutional provider (refer to § 199.6, including inpatient admission to a residential treatment center, substance use disorder rehabilitation facility residential treatment program, or skilled nursing facility) shall be cost-shared on an inpatient basis. The cost-sharing for inpatient services subject to the TRICARE DRG-based payment system and the TRICARE per diem system shall be the lesser of the respective per diem copayment amount multiplied by the total number of days in the hospital (except for the day of discharge under the DRG payment system), or 25 percent of the hospital's billed charges. For other inpatient services, the cost-share shall be 25% of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charges.
(iii)
Outpatient cost-sharing.
Former members and dependents of former members are responsible for payment
of 25 percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable costs or charges beyond the annual calendar year deductible amount (as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section) for otherwise covered services or supplies provided on an outpatient basis by authorized providers.
(4)
Former spouses.
CHAMPUS beneficiary liability for former spouses eligible under the provisions set forth in § 199.3 of this part is as follows:
(i)
Annual calendar year deductible for outpatient services or supplies.
An eligible former spouse is responsible for the payment of the first $150.00 of the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable costs or charges for otherwise covered outpatient services or supplies provided in any one calendar year. (Except for services received prior to April 1, 1991, the deductible amount is $50.00). The former spouse cannot contribute to, nor benefit from, any family deductible of the member or former member to whom the former spouse was married or of any CHAMPUS-eligible children.
(ii)
Inpatient cost-sharing.
Eligible former spouses are responsible for payment of cost-sharing amounts the same as those required for former members and dependents of former members.
(iii)
Outpatient cost-sharing.
Eligible former spouses are responsible for payment of 25 percent of the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable costs or charges beyond the annual calendar year deductible amount for otherwise covered services or supplies provided on an outpatient basis by authorized providers.
(5)
Cost-Sharing under the Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program.
Cost-sharing is dependent upon the type of partnership program entered into, whether external or internal. (See paragraph (p) of § 199.1, for general requirements of the Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program.)
(i)
External Partnership Agreement.
Authorized costs associated with the use of the civilian facility will be financed through CHAMPUS under the normal cost-sharing and reimbursement procedures applicable under CHAMPUS.
(ii)
Internal Partnership Agreement.
Beneficiary cost-sharing under internal agreements will be the same as charges prescribed for care in military treatment facilities.
(6)-(7) [Reserved]
(8)
Cost-sharing for services provided under special discount arrangements
—(i)
General rule.
With respect to services determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) to be covered by § 199.14(e), the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) has authority to establish, as an exception to the cost-sharing amount normally required pursuant to this section, a different cost-share amount that appropriately reflects the application of the statutory cost-share to the discount arrangement.
(ii)
Specific applications.
The following are examples of applications of the general rule; they are not all inclusive.
(A) In the case of services provided by individual health care professionals and other noninstitutional providers, the cost-share shall be the usual percentage of the CHAMPUS allowable charge determined under § 199.14(e).
(B) In the case of services provided by institutional providers normally paid on the basis of a pre-set amount (such as DRG-based amount under § 199.14(a)(1) or per-diem amount under § 199.14(a)(2)), if the discount rate is lower than the pre-set rate, the cost-share amount that would apply for a beneficiary other than an active duty dependent pursuant to the normal pre-set rate would be reduced by the same percentage by which the pre-set rate was reduced in setting the discount rate.
(9)
Waiver of deductible amounts or cost-sharing not allowed
—(i)
General rule.
Because deductible amounts and cost sharing are statutorily mandated, except when specifically authorized by law (as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS), a provider may not waive or forgive beneficiary liability for annual deductible amounts or inpatient or outpatient cost sharing, as set forth in this section.
(ii)
Exception for bad debts.
This general rule is not violated in cases in which a provider has made all reasonable attempts to effect collection, without success, and determines in accordance with generally accepted fiscal
management standards that the beneficiary liability in a particular case is an uncollectible bad debt.
(iii)
Remedies for noncompliance.
Potential remedies for noncompliance with this requirement include:
(A) A claim for services regarding which the provider has waived the beneficiary's liability may be disallowed in full, or, alternatively, the amount payable for such a claim may be reduced by the amount of the beneficiary liability waived.
(B) Repeated noncompliance with this requirement is a basis for exclusion of a provider.
(10)
Catastrophic loss protection for basic program benefits.
Calendar year limits, or catastrophic caps, on the amounts beneficiaries are required to pay are established as follows:
(i)
Dependents of active duty members.
The maximum family liability is $1,000 for deductibles and cost-shares based on allowable charges for Basic Program services and supplies received in a calendar year.
(ii)
All other beneficiaries.
For all other categories of beneficiary families (including those eligible under CHAMPVA) the calendar year cap is $3,000.
(iii)
Payment after cap is met.
After a family has paid the maximum cost-share and deductible amounts (dependents of active duty members $1,000 and all others $3,000), for a calendar year, CHAMPUS will pay allowable amounts for remaining covered services through the end of that calendar year.

# Note to paragraph (
f

# )(10):
Under the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, the cap for beneficiaries other than dependents of active duty members was reduced from $7,500 to $3,000 effective October 30, 2000. Prior to this, the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 reduced this cap from $10,000 to $7,500 on October 1, 1992. The cap remains at $1,000 for dependents of active duty members.
(11)
Beneficiary or sponsor liability under the Pharmacy Benefits Program.
Beneficiary or sponsor liability under the Pharmacy Benefits Program is addressed in § 199.21.
(12)
Elimination of cost-sharing for certain preventive services.
(i) Effective for dates of service on or after October 14, 2008, beneficiaries, subject to the limitation in paragraph (f)(12)(iii) of this section, shall not pay any cost-share for preventive services listed in paragraph (e)(28)(i) through (iv) of this section. The beneficiary shall not be required to pay any portion of the cost of these preventive services even if the beneficiary has not satisfied the deductible for that year.
(ii) Beneficiaries who paid a cost-share for preventive services listed in paragraph (e)(28)(i) through (iv) of this section on or after October 14, 2008, may request reimbursement until January 28, 2013 according to procedures established by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity.
(iii) This elimination of cost-sharing for preventive services does not apply to any beneficiary who is a Medicare-eligible beneficiary. For purposes of this section, the term “Medicare-eligible” beneficiary is defined in 10 U.S.C. 1111(b) and refers to a person eligible for Medicare Part A.
(iv) Appropriate copayments and deductibles will apply for all services not listed in paragraph (e)(28) of this section, whether considered preventive in nature or not.
(13)
Special transition rule for the last quarter of calendar year 2017.
In order to transition deductibles and catastrophic caps from a fiscal year basis to a calendar year basis, the deductible amount and the catastrophic cap amount specified in paragraph (f) of this section will be applicable to the 15-month period of October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017.

# Note:
If it is determined that the diagnostic x-ray, laboratory, and pathological services and machine tests performed during such admission were medically necessary and would have been covered if performed on an outpatient basis, CHAMPUS benefits may be extended for such diagnostic procedures only, but cost-sharing will be computed as if performed on an outpatient basis.
(5)
Unnecessary postpartum inpatient stay, mother or newborn.
Postpartum inpatient stay of a mother for purposes of staying with the newborn infant (usually primarily for the purpose of breast feeding the infant) when the infant (but not the mother) requires the extended stay; or continued inpatient stay of a newborn infant primarily for purposes of remaining with the mother when the mother (but not the newborn infant) requires extended postpartum inpatient stay.

Services or supplies for which the beneficiary or sponsor has no legal obligation to pay; or for which no charge would be made if the beneficiary or sponsor was not eligible under CHAMPUS; or whenever CHAMPUS is a secondary payer for claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, amounts, when combined with the primary payment, which would be in excess of charges (or the amount the provider is obligated to accept as payment in full, if it is less than the charges).
(12)
Furnished without charge.
Services or supplies furnished without charge.
(13)
Furnished by local, state, or Federal Government.
Services and supplies paid for, or eligible for payment, directly or indirectly by a local, state, or Federal Government, except as provided under CHAMPUS, or by government hospitals serving the general public, or medical care provided by a Uniformed Service medical care facility, or benefits provided under title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) (refer to § 199.8 of this part).
(14)
Study, grant, or research programs.
Services and supplies provided as a part of or under a scientific or medical study, grant, or research program.
(15)
Unproven drugs, devices, and medical treatments or procedures.
By law, CHAMPUS can only cost-share medically necessary supplies and services. Any drug, device, or medical treatment or procedure, the safety and efficacy of which have not been established, as described in this paragraph (g)(15), is unproved and cannot be cost-shared by CHAMPUS except as authorized under paragraph 199.4(e)(26) of this part.
(i) A drug, device, or medical treatment or procedure is unproven:
(A) If the drug or device cannot be lawfully marketed without the approval or clearance of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and approval or clearance for marketing has not been given at the time the drug or device is furnished to the patient.

# Note to paragraph (
g

# )(15)(
i

# )(A):
Although the use of drugs and medicines not approved
by the FDA for commercial marketing, that is for use by humans, (even though permitted for testing on humans) is excluded from coverage as unproven, drugs grandfathered by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 may be covered by CHAMPUS as if FDA approved.
Certain cancer drugs, designated as Group C drugs (approved and distributed by the National Cancer Institute) and Treatment Investigational New Drugs (INDs), are not covered under CHAMPUS because they are not approved for commercial marketing by the FDA. However, medical care related to the use of Group C drugs and Treatment INDs can be cost-shared under CHAMPUS when the patient's medical condition warrants their administration and the care is provided in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice. For the duration of the President's national emergency in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, TRICARE will cost-share investigational drugs provided for the treatment of COVID-19 under expanded access.
CHAMPUS will consider coverage of off-label uses of drugs and devices that meet the definition of Off-Label Use of a Drug or Device in § 199.2(b). Approval for reimbursement of off-label uses requires review for medical necessity and also requires demonstrations from medical literature, national organizations, or technology assessment bodies that the off-label use of the drug or device is safe, effective, and in accordance with nationally accepted standards of practice in the medical community.
(B) If a medical device (as defined by 21 U.S.C. 321(h)) with an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approved by the Food and Drug Administration is categorized by the FDA as experimental/investigational (FDA Category A).

# Note:
CHAMPUS will consider for coverage a device with an FDA-approved IDE categorized by the FDA as non-experimental/investigational (FDA Category B) for CHAMPUS beneficiaries participating in FDA approved clinical trials. Coverage of any such Category B device is dependent on its meeting all other requirements of the laws and rules governing CHAMPUS and upon the beneficiary involved meeting the FDA-approved IDE study protocols.
(C) Unless reliable evidence shows that any medical treatment or procedure has been the subject of well-controlled studies of clinically meaningful endpoints, which have determined its maximum tolerated dose, its toxicity, its safety, and its efficacy as compared with standard means of treatment or diagnosis. (See the definition of
reliable evidence
in § 199.2 of this part for the procedures used in determining if a medical treatment or procedure is unproven.)
(D) If reliable evidence shows that the consensus among experts regarding the medical treatment or procedure is that further studies or clinical trials are necessary to determine its maximum tolerated doses, its toxicity, its safety, or its effectiveness as compared with the standard means of treatment or diagnosis (see the definition of reliable evidence in § 199.2 for the procedures used in determining if a medical treatment or procedure is unproven).
(ii) CHAMPUS benefits for rare diseases are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Director, Office of CHAMPUS, or a designee. In reviewing the case, the Director, or a designee, may consult with any or all of the following sources to determine if the proposed therapy is considered safe and effective:
(A) Trials published in refereed medical literature.
(B) Formal technology assessments.
(C) National medical policy organization positions.
(D) National professional associations.
(E) National expert opinion organizations.
(iii)
Care excluded.
This exclusion from benefits includes all services directly related to the unproven drug, device, or medical treatment or procedure. However, CHAMPUS may cover services or supplies when there is no logical or causal relationship between the unproven drug, device or medical treatment or procedure and the treatment at issue or where such a logical or causal relationship cannot be established with a sufficient degree of certainty. This CHAMPUS coverage is authorized in the following circumstances:
(A) Treatment that is not related to the unproven drug, device or medical treatment or procedure; e.g., medically necessary in the absence of the unproven treatment.
(B) Treatment which is necessary follow-up to the unproven drug, device or medical treatment or procedure but
which might have been necessary in the absence of the unproven treatment.

(h)
Payment and liability for certain potentially excludable services under the Peer Review Organization program
—(1)
Applicability.
This subsection provides special rules that apply only to services retrospectively determined under the Peer Review organization (PRO) program (operated pursuant to § 199.15) to be potentially excludable (in whole or in part) from the basic program under paragraph (g) of this section. Services may be excluded by reason of being not medically necessary (paragraph (g)(1) of this section), at an inappropriate level (paragraph (g)(3) of this section), custodial care (paragraph
(g)(7) of this section) or other reason relative to reasonableness, necessity or appropriateness (which services shall throughout the remainder of this subsection, be referred to as “not medically necessary”). (Also throughout the remainder of the subsection, “services” includes items and “provider” includes supplier). This paragraph does not apply to coverage determinations made by OCHAMPUS or the fiscal intermediaries which are not based on medical necessity determinations made under the PRO program.
(2)
Payment for certain potentially excludable expenses.
Services determined under the PRO program to be potentially excludable by reason of the exclusions in paragraph (g) of this section for not medically necessary services will not be determined to be excludable if neither the beneficiary to whom the services were provided nor the provider (institutional or individual) who furnished the services knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the services were subject to those exclusions. Payment may be made for such services as if the exclusions did not apply.
(3)
Liability for certain excludable services.
In any case in which items or services are determined excludable by the PRO program by reason of being not medically necessary and payment may not be made under paragraph (h)(2) of this section because the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this section are not met, the beneficiary may not be held liable (and shall be entitled to a full refund from the provider of the amount excluded and any cost share amount already paid) if:
(i) The beneficiary did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the services were excludable by reason of being not medically necessary; and
(ii) The provider knew or could reasonably have been expected to know that the items or services were excludable by reason of being not medically necessary.
(4)
Criteria for determining that beneficiary knew or could reasonably have been expected to have known that services were excludable.
A beneficiary who receives services excludable by reason of being not medically necessary will be found to have known that the services were excludable if the beneficiary has been given written notice that the services were excludable or that similar or comparable services provided on a previous occasion were excludable and that notice was given by the OCHAMPUS, CHAMPUS PRO or fiscal intermediary, a group or committee responsible for utilization review for the provider, or the provider who provided the services.
(5)
Criteria for determining that provider knew or could reasonably have been expected to have known that services were excludable.
An institutional or individual provider will be found to have known or been reasonably expected to have known that services were excludable under this subsection under any one of the following circumstances:
(i) The PRO or fiscal intermediary had informed the provider that the services provided were excludable or that similar or reasonably comparable services were excludable.
(ii) The utilization review group or committee for an institutional provider or the beneficiary's attending physician had informed the provider that the services provided were excludable.
(iii) The provider had informed the beneficiary that the services were excludable.
(iv) The provider had received written materials, including notices, manual issuances, bulletins, guides, directives or other materials, providing notification of PRO screening criteria specific to the condition of the beneficiary. Attending physicians who are members of the medical staff of an institutional provider will be found to have also received written materials provided to the institutional provider.
(v) The services that are at issue are the subject of what are generally considered acceptable standards of practice by the local medical community.
(vi) Preadmission authorization was available but not requested, or concurrent review requirements were not followed.

§ 199.5
TRICARE Extended Care Health Option (ECHO).
(a)
General.
(1) The TRICARE ECHO is essentially a supplemental program to the TRICARE Basic Program. It does not provide acute care nor benefits available through the TRICARE Basic Program.
(2) The purpose of the ECHO is to provide an additional financial resource for an integrated set of services and supplies designed to assist in the reduction of the disabling effects of the ECHO-eligible dependent's qualifying condition. Services include those necessary to maintain, minimize or prevent deterioration of function of an ECHO-eligible dependent.
(3) The Government's cost-share for ECHO or ECHO home health benefits during any program year is limited as stated in this section. In order to transition the program year from a fiscal year to a calendar year basis, the Government's annual cost-share limitation specified in paragraph (f) of this section shall be prorated for the last quarter of calendar year 2018 as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1079(f)(2)(A).
(b)
Eligibility.
(1) The following categories of TRICARE/CHAMPUS beneficiaries with a qualifying condition are ECHO-eligible dependents:
(i) A spouse, child, or unmarried person (as described in § 199.3(b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (b)(2)(iv)) of a member of the Uniformed Services on active duty for a period of more than 30 days.
(ii) An abused dependent as described in § 199.3(b)(2)(iii).
(iii) A spouse, child, or unmarried person (as described in § 199.3(b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (b)(2)(iv)), of a member of the Uniformed Services who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days and whose death occurs on or after October 7, 2001. In such case, an eligible surviving spouse remains eligible for benefits under the ECHO for a period of 3 years from the date the active duty sponsor dies. Any other eligible surviving dependent remains eligible for benefits under the ECHO for a period of three years from the date the active duty sponsor dies or until the surviving eligible dependent:
(A) Attains 21 years of age, or
(B) Attains 23 years of age or ceases to pursue a full-time course of study prior to attaining 23 years of age, if, at 21 years of age, the eligible surviving dependent is enrolled in a full-time course of study in a secondary school or in a full-time course of study in an institution of higher education approved by Secretary of Defense and was, at the time of the sponsor's death, in fact dependent on the member for over one-half of such dependent's support.
(iv) A spouse, child, or unmarried person (as defined in paragraphs § 199.3(b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (b)(2)(iv)) of a deceased member of the Uniformed Services who, at the time of the member's death was receiving benefits under ECHO, and the member at the time of death was eligible for receipt of hostile-fire pay, or died as a result of a disease or injury incurred while eligible for such pay. In such a case, the surviving dependent remains eligible for benefits under ECHO through midnight of the dependent's twenty-first birthday.
(2)
Qualifying condition.
The following are qualifying conditions:
(i)
Mental retardation.
A diagnosis of moderate or severe mental retardation made in accordance with the criteria of the current edition of the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders” published by the American Psychiatric Association.
(ii)
Serious physical disability.
A serious physical disability as defined in § 199.2.
(iii)
Extraordinary physical or psychological condition.
An extraordinary physical or psychological condition as defined in § 199.2.
(iv)
Infant/toddler.
Beneficiaries under the age of 3 years who are diagnosed with a neuromuscular developmental condition or other condition that is expected to precede a diagnosis of moderate or severe mental retardation or a serious physical disability, shall be deemed to have a qualifying condition for the ECHO. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee shall establish criteria for ECHO eligibility in lieu of the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section.
(v)
Multiple disabilities.
The cumulative effect of multiple disabilities, as determined by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee shall be used in lieu of the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section to determine a qualifying condition when the beneficiary has two or more disabilities involving separate body systems.
(3)
Loss of ECHO eligibility.
Eligibility for ECHO benefits ceases as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day that:
(i) The sponsor ceases to be an active duty member for any reason other than death; or
(ii) Eligibility based upon the abused dependent provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section expires; or
(iii) Eligibility based upon the deceased sponsor provisions of paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) or (iv) of this section expires; or
(iv) Eligibility based upon a beneficiary's participation in the Transitional Assistance Management Program ends; or
(v) The Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee determines that the beneficiary no longer has a qualifying condition.
(c)
ECHO benefit.
Items and services that the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee has determined are capable of confirming, arresting, or reducing the severity of the disabling effects of a qualifying condition, includes, but are not limited to:
(1) Diagnostic procedures to establish a qualifying condition or to measure the extent of functional loss resulting from a qualifying condition.
(2) Medical, habilitative, rehabilitative services and supplies, durable equipment and assistive technology (AT) devices that assist in the reduction of the disabling effects of a qualifying condition. Benefits shall be provided in the beneficiary's home or another environment, as appropriate. An AT device may be covered only if it is recommended in a beneficiary's Individual Educational Program (IEP) or, if the beneficiary is not eligible for an IEP, the AT device is an item or educational learning device normally included in an IEP and is preauthorized under ECHO as an integral component of the beneficiary's individual comprehensive health care services plan (including rehabilitation) as prescribed by a TRICARE authorized provider.
(i) An AT device may be covered under ECHO only if it is not otherwise covered by TRICARE as durable equipment, a prosthetic, augmentation communication device, or other benefits under § 199.4.
(ii) An AT device may include an educational learning device directly related to the beneficiary's qualifying condition when recommended by an IEP and not otherwise provided by State or local government programs. If an individual is not eligible for an IEP, an educational learning device normally included in the IEP may be authorized as if directly related to the beneficiary's qualifying condition and prescribed by a TRICARE authorized provider as part of the beneficiary's individual comprehensive health care services plan.
(iii) Electronic learning devices may include the hardware and software as appropriate. The Director, DHA, shall determine the types and (or) platforms of electronic devices and the replacement lifecycle of the hardware and its supporting software. All upgrades or replacements shall require a recommendation from the individual's IEP or the individual's comprehensive health care services plan.
(iv) Duplicative or redundant hardware platforms are not authorized.

# Note to paragraph (
c

# )(2)(
iv

# ):
When one or more electronic platforms such as a desktop computer, laptop, notebook or tablet can perform the same functions in relation to the teaching or educational objective directly related to the qualifying condition, it is the intent of this provision to allow only one electronic platform that may be chosen by the beneficiary. Duplicative or redundant platforms are not allowed; however, a second platform may be obtained, if the individual's IEP recommends one platform such as a computer for the majority of the learning objectives, but there exists another objective, which cannot be performed on that platform. In these limited circumstances, the beneficiary may submit a request with the above justification to the Director, TMA, who may authorize a second device.
(v) AT devices damaged through improper use of the device may not be replaced until the device would next be eligible for a lifecycle replacement.
(vi) AT devices do not include equipment or devices whose primary purpose is to assist the individual to engage in sports or recreational activities.
(3) Training that teaches the use of assistive technology devices or to acquire skills that are necessary for the management of the qualifying condition.

(5) Institutional care within a state, as defined in § 199.2, in private nonprofit, public, and state institutions and facilities, when the severity of the qualifying condition requires protective custody or training in a residential environment. For the purpose of this section protective custody means residential care that is necessary when the severity of the qualifying condition is such that the safety and well-being of the beneficiary or those who come into contact with the beneficiary may be in jeopardy without such care.
(6) Transportation of an ECHO beneficiary receiving benefits under paragraph (c)(5), and a medical attendant when necessary to assure the beneficiary's safety, to or from a facility or institution to receive authorized ECHO services or items.

Respite care services will be provided by a TRICARE-authorized HHA and will be designed to provide health care services for the covered beneficiary. The benefit will not be cumulative, that is, any respite hours not used in one month will not be carried over or banked for use on another occasion.
(i) TRICARE-authorized home health agencies must provide and bill for all authorized ECHO respite care services through established TRICARE claims' mechanisms. No special billing arrangements will be authorized in conjunction with coverage that may be provided by Medicaid or other federal, state, community or private programs.

(e)
ECHO Home Health Care (EHHC).
The EHHC benefit provides coverage of home health care services and respite care services specified in this section.
(1)
Home health care.
Covered ECHO home health care services are the same as, and provided under the same conditions as those services described in § 199.4(e)(21)(i), except that they are not limited to part-time or intermittent services. Custodial care services, as defined in § 199.2, may be provided to the extent such services are provided in conjunction with authorized ECHO home health care services, including the EHHC respite care benefit specified in this section. Beneficiaries who are authorized EHHC will receive all home health care services under EHHC and no portion will be provided under the Basic Program. TRICARE-authorized home health agencies are not required to use the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) to assess beneficiaries who are authorized EHHC.
(2)
Respite care.
EHHC beneficiaries whose plan of care includes frequent interventions by the primary caregiver(s) are eligible for respite care services in lieu of the ECHO general respite care benefit. For the purpose of this section, the term “frequent” means “more than two interventions during the eight-hour period per day that the primary caregiver would normally be sleeping.” The services performed by the primary caregiver are those that can be performed safely and effectively by the average non-medical person without direct supervision of a health care provider after the primary caregiver has been trained by appropriate medical personnel. EHHC beneficiaries in this situation are eligible for a maximum of eight hours per day, 5 days per week, of respite care by a TRICARE-authorized home health agency. The home health agency will provide the health care interventions or services for the covered beneficiary so that the primary caregiver is relieved of the responsibility to provide such interventions or services for the duration of that period of respite care. The home health agency will not provide baby-sitting or child care services for other members of the family. The benefit is not cumulative, that is, any respite care hours not used in a given day may not be carried over or banked for use on another occasion. Additionally, the eight-hour respite care periods will not be provided consecutively, that is, a respite care period on one calendar day will not be immediately followed by a respite care period the next calendar day. The Government's cost-share incurred for these services accrue to the maximum yearly ECHO Home Health Care benefit.
(3)
EHHC eligibility.
The EHHC is authorized for beneficiaries who meet all applicable ECHO eligibility requirements and who:
(i) Physically reside within the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or Guam; and
(ii) Are homebound, as defined in § 199.2; and
(iii) Require medically necessary skilled services that exceed the level of coverage provided under the Basic Program's home health care benefit; and/or
(iv) Require frequent interventions by the primary caregiver(s) such that respite care services are necessary to allow primary caregiver(s) the opportunity to rest; and
(v) Are case managed to include a reassessment at least every 90 days, and receive services as outlined in a written plan of care; and
(vi) Receive all home health care services from a TRICARE-authorized home health agency, as described in § 199.6(b)(4)(xv), in the beneficiary's primary residence.
(4)
EHHC plan of care.
A written plan of care is required prior to authorizing ECHO home health care. The plan must include the type, frequency, scope and duration of the care to be provided and support the professional level of provider. Reimbursement will not be authorized for a level of provider not identified in the plan of care.
(5)
EHHC exclusions
—(i)
General.
ECHO Home Health Care services and supplies are excluded from those who are being provided continuing coverage of home health care as participants of
the former Individual Case Management Program for Persons with Extraordinary Conditions (ICMP-PEC) or previous case management demonstrations.
(ii)
Respite care.
Respite care for the purpose of covering primary caregiver absences due to deployment, employment, seeking of employment or to pursue education is excluded. Authorized respite care covers only the ECHO beneficiary, not siblings or others who may reside in or be visiting in the beneficiary's residence.
(f)
Cost-share liability
—(1)
No deductible.
ECHO benefits are not subject to a deductible amount.
(2)
Sponsor cost-share liability.

(ii) The Sponsor's cost-share shown in Table 1 in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section will be applied to the first allowed ECHO charges in any given month. The Government's share will be paid, up to the maximum amount specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, for allowed charges after the sponsor's cost-share has been applied.
(iii) The provisions of § 199.18(d)(1) and (e)(1) regarding elimination of copayments for active duty family members enrolled in TRICARE Prime do not eliminate, reduce, or otherwise affect the sponsor's cost-share shown in Table 1 in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
(iv) The sponsor's cost-share shown in Table 1 in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section does not accrue to the Basic Program's Catastrophic Loss Protection under 10 U.S.C. 1079(b)(5) as shown at §§ 199.4(f)(10) and 199.18(f).
(3)
Government cost-share liability

(B) When a beneficiary moves to a different locality within the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or Guam, the annual program year cap will be recalculated to reflect the maximum established under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for the beneficiary's new location and will apply to the EHHC benefit for the remaining portion of that program year.
(g)
Benefit payment
—(1)
Transportation.
The allowable amount for transportation of an ECHO beneficiary is limited to the actual cost of the standard published fare plus any standard surcharge made to accommodate any person with a similar disability or to the actual cost of specialized medical transportation when non-specialized transport cannot accommodate the beneficiary's qualifying condition related needs, or when specialized transport is more economical than non-specialized transport. When transport is by private vehicle, the allowable amount is limited to the Federal government employee mileage reimbursement rate in effect on the date the transportation is provided.
(2)
Equipment.
(i) The TRICARE allowable amount for DE or AT devices shall be calculated in the same manner as DME allowable through section 199.4 of this title, and accrues to the program year benefit limit specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(ii) Cost-share. A cost-share, as provided by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, is required for each month in which equipment or an AT device is purchased under this section. However, in no month shall a sponsor be required to pay more than one cost-share regardless of the number of benefits the sponsor's dependents received under this section.
(3)

(ii) Is provided based upon the ECHO beneficiary's being eligible for the publicly funded program which has contracted for the care; and
(iii) Is authorized by the public facility as a part of a publicly funded program; and
(iv) Would cause a cost-share liability in the absence of TRICARE eligibility; and
(v) Produces an ECHO beneficiary cost-share liability that does not exceed the maximum charge by the provider to the public facility for the contracted level of care.
(4)
ECHO home health care and EHHC respite care.
(i) TRICARE-authorized home health agencies must provide and bill for all authorized home health care services through established TRICARE claims' mechanisms. No special billing arrangements will be authorized in conjunction with coverage that may be provided by Medicaid or other federal, state, community or private programs.
(ii) For authorized ECHO home health care and respite care, TRICARE will reimburse the allowable charges or negotiated rates.
(iii) The maximum monthly Government reimbursement for EHHC, including EHHC respite care, will be based on the actual number of hours of EHHC services rendered in the month, but in no case will it exceed one-twelfth of the annual maximum Government cost-share as determined in this section and adjusted according to the actual number of days in the month the services were provided.
(h)
Other Requirements
—(1)
Applicable part.
All provisions of this part, except the provisions of § 199.4 unless otherwise provided by this section or as directed by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee, apply to the ECHO.
(2)
Registration.
Active duty sponsors must register potential ECHO-eligible beneficiaries through the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or designee prior to receiving ECHO benefits. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or designee will determine ECHO eligibility and update the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System accordingly. Unless waived by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee, sponsors must provide evidence of enrollment in the Exceptional Family Member Program provided by their branch of Service at the time they register their family member(s) for the ECHO.
(3)
Benefit authorization.
All ECHO benefits require authorization by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee prior to receipt of such benefits.
(i)
Documentation.
The sponsor shall provide such documentation as the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee requires as a prerequisite to authorizing ECHO benefits. Such documentation shall describe how the requested benefit will contribute to confirming, arresting, or reducing the disabling effects of the qualifying condition, including maintenance of function or prevention of further deterioration of function, of the beneficiary.
(ii)
Format.
An authorization issued by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee shall specify such description, dates, amounts, requirements, limitations or information as necessary for exact identification of approved benefits and efficient adjudication of resulting claims.
(iii)
Valid period.
An authorization for ECHO benefits shall be valid until such time as the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee determines that the authorized services are no longer appropriate or required or the beneficiary is no longer eligible under paragraph (b) of this section.
(iv)
Authorization waiver.
The Director, TRICARE Management Activity or
designee may waive the requirement for a written authorization for rendered ECHO benefits that, except for the absence of the written authorization, would be allowable as an ECHO benefit.
(v)
Public facility use.
(A) An ECHO beneficiary residing within a state must demonstrate that a public facility is not available and adequate to meet the needs of their qualifying condition. Such requirements shall apply to beneficiaries who request authorization for training, rehabilitation, special education, assistive technology, and institutional care in private nonprofit, public, and state institutions and facilities, and if appropriate for beneficiaries receiving institutional care, transportation to and from such institutions and facilities. The maximum Government cost-share for services that require demonstration of public facility non-availability or inadequacy is limited to $36,000 per program year per beneficiary. State-administered plans for medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) are not considered available and adequate facilities for the purpose of this section.
(B) The domicile of the beneficiary shall be the basis for the determination of public facility availability when the sponsor and beneficiary are separately domiciled due to the sponsor's move to a new permanent duty station or due to legal custody requirements.
(C) Written certification, in accordance with information requirements, formats, and procedures established by the director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee that requested ECHO services or items cannot be obtained from public facilities because the services or items are not available and adequate, is a prerequisite for ECHO benefit payment for training, rehabilitation, special education, assistive technology, and institutional care in private nonprofit, public, and state institutions and facilities, and if appropriate, transportation to and from such institutions and facilities.
(
1
) An administrator or designee of a public facility may make such certification for a beneficiary residing within the service area of that public facility.
(
2
) The Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that apparent public facility availability or adequacy for a requested type of service or item cannot be substantiated for a specific beneficiary's request for ECHO benefits and therefore is not available.
(
i
) A case-specific determination shall be based upon a written statement by the beneficiary (or sponsor or guardian acting on behalf of the beneficiary) which details the circumstances wherein a specific individual representing a specific public facility refused to provide a public facility use certification, and such other information as the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee determines to be material to the determination.
(
ii
) A case-specific determination of public facility availability by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee is conclusive and is not appealable under § 199.10.
(4) Repair or maintenance of DE owned by the beneficiary or an AT device is exempt from the public facility-use certification requirements.
(5) The requirements of this paragraph (h)(3)(v)(A) notwithstanding, no public facility use certification is required for services and items that are provided under Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in accordance with the Individualized Family Services Plan and that are otherwise allowable under the ECHO.
(i)
Implementing instructions.
The Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee shall issue TRICARE policies, instructions, procedures, guidelines, standards, and criteria as may be necessary to implement the intent of this section.

[69 FR 51564, Aug. 20, 2004, as amended at 71 FR 47092, Aug. 16, 2006; 72 FR 2447, Jan. 19, 2007; 75 FR 47711, Aug. 9, 2010; 79 FR 78713, Dec. 31, 2014; 81 FR 27329, May 6, 2016; 82 FR 45447, Sept. 29, 2017; 86 FR 36217, July 9, 2021]
§ 199.6
TRICARE—authorized providers.
(a)
General.
This section sets forth general policies and procedures that are the basis for the CHAMPUS cost-sharing of medical services and supplies provided by institutions, individuals, or other types of providers. Providers seeking payment from the Federal Government through programs such as CHAMPUS have a duty to familiarize themselves with, and comply with, the program requirements.
(1)
Listing of provider does not guarantee payment of benefits.
The fact that a type of provider is listed in this section is not to be construed to mean that CHAMPUS will automatically pay a claim for services or supplies provided by such a provider. The provider who actually furnishes the service(s) must, in fact, meet all licensing and other requirements established by this part to be an authorized provider; the provider must not be the subject of sanction under § 199.9; and, cost-sharing of the services must not otherwise be prohibited by this part. In addition, the patient must in fact be an eligible beneficiary and the services or supplies billed must be authorized and medically necessary, regardless of the standing of the provider.
(2)
Outside the United States or emergency situations within the United States.
Outside the United States or within the United States and Puerto Rico in emergency situations, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, after review of the facts, may provide payment to or on behalf of a beneficiary who receives otherwise covered services or supplies from a provider of service that does not meet the standards described in this part.

# Note:
Only the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the Secretary of Transportation, or their designees, may authorize (in emergency situations) payment to civilian facilities in the United States that are not in compliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. For the purpose of the Civil Rights Act only, the United States includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Wake Island, Canal Zone, and the territories and possessions of the United States.
(3)
Dual compensation/Conflict of interest.
Title 5, United States Code, section 5536 prohibits medical personnel who are active duty Uniformed Service members or civilian employees of the Government from receiving additional Government compensation above their normal pay and allowances for medical care furnished. In addition, Uniformed Service members and civilian employees of the Government are generally prohibited by law and agency regulations and policies from participating in apparent or actual conflict of interest situations in which a potential for personal gain exists or in which there is an appearance of impropriety or incompatibility with the performance of their official duties or responsibilities. The Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Transportation have a responsibility, when disbursing appropriated funds in the payment of CHAMPUS benefits, to ensure that the laws and regulations are not violated. Therefore, active duty Uniformed Service members (including a reserve member while on active duty and civilian employees of the United States Government shall not be authorized to be CHAMPUS providers. While individual employees of the Government may be able to demonstrate that the furnishing of care to CHAMPUS beneficiaries may not be incompatible with their official duties and responsibilities, the processing of millions of CHAMPUS claims each year does not enable Program administrators to efficiently review the status of the provider on each claim to ensure that no conflict of interest or dual compensation situation exists. The problem is further complicated given the numerous interagency agreements (for example, resource sharing arrangements between the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration in the provision of health care) and other unique arrangements which exist at individual treatment facilities around the country. While an individual provider may be prevented from being an authorized CHAMPUS provider even though no conflict of interest or dual compensation situation exists, it is essential for CHAMPUS to have an easily administered, uniform rule which will ensure compliance with
the existing laws and regulations. Therefore, a provider who is an active duty Uniformed Service member or civilian employee of the Government shall not be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. In addition, a provider shall certify on each CHAMPUS claim that he/she is not an active duty Uniformed Service member or civilian employee of the Government.
(4) [Reserved]
(5)
Utilization review and quality assurance.
Providers approved as authorized CHAMPUS providers have certain obligations to provide services and supplies under CHAMPUS which are (i) furnished at the appropriate level and only when and to the extent medically necessary under the criteria of this part; (ii) of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of health care; and, (iii) supported by adequate medical documentation as may be reasonably required under this part by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, to evidence the medical necessity and quality of services furnished, as well as the appropriateness of the level of care. Therefore, the authorization of CHAMPUS benefits is contingent upon the services and supplies furnished by any provider being subject to pre-payment or post-payment utilization and quality assurance review under professionally recognized standards, norms, and criteria, as well as any standards or criteria issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, pursuant to this part. (Refer to §§ 199.4, 199.5, and 199.7 of this part.)
(6)
Exclusion of beneficiary liability.
In connection with certain utilization review, quality assurance and preauthorization requirements of section 199.4 of this part, providers may not hold patients liable for payment for certain services for which CHAMPUS payment is disallowed. With respect to such services, providers may not seek payment from the patient or the patient's family. Any such effort to seek payment is a basis for termination of the provider's authorized status.
(7)
Provider required.
In order to be considered for benefits, all services and supplies shall be rendered by, prescribed by, or furnished at the direction of, or on the order of a CHAMPUS-authorized provider practicing within the scope of his or her license.
(8)
Participating providers.
A CHAMPUS-authorized provider is a participating provider, as defined in § 199.2 under the following circumstances:
(i)
Mandatory participation.
(A) An institutional provider in § 199.6(b), in order to be an authorized provider under TRICARE, must be a participating provider for all claims.
(B) A SNF or a HHA, in order to be an authorized provider under TRICARE, must enter into a participation agreement with TRICARE for all claims.
(C) Corporate services providers authorized as CHAMPUS providers under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section must enter into a participation agreement as provided by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee.
(ii)
Voluntary participation
—(A)
Total claims participation: The participating provider program.
A CHAMPUS-authorized provider that is not required to participate by this part may become a participating provider by entering into an agreement or memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, which includes, but is not limited to, the provisions of paragraph (a)(13) of this section. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may include in a participating provider agreement/MOU provisions that establish between CHAMPUS and a class, category, type, or specific provider, uniform procedures and conditions which encourage provider participation while improving beneficiary access to benefits and contributing to CHAMPUS efficiency. Such provisions shall be otherwise allowed by this part or by DoD Directive or DoD Instruction specifically pertaining to CHAMPUS claims participation. Participating provider program provisions may be incorporated into an agreement/MOU to establish a specific CHAMPUS-provider relationship, such as a preferred provider arrangement.
(B)
Claim-specific participation.
A CHAMPUS-authorized provider that is not required to participate and that has not entered into a participation agreement pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(A) of this section may elect to
be a participating provider on a claim-by-claim basis by indicating “accept assignment” on each claim form for which participation is elected.
(iii)
Claim-by-claim participation.
Individual providers that are not participating providers pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section may elect to participate on a claim-by-claim basis. They may do so by signing the appropriate space on the claims form and submitting it to the appropriate TRICARE contractor on behalf of the beneficiary.
(9)
Limitation to authorized institutional provider designation.
Authorized institutional provider status granted to a specific institutional provider applicant does not extend to any institution-affiliated provider, as defined in § 199.2, of that specific applicant.
(10)
Authorized provider.
A hospital or institutional provider, physician, or other individual professional provider, or other provider of services or supplies specifically authorized in this chapter to provide benefits under CHAMPUS. In addition, to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider, any hospital which is a CHAMPUS participating provider under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, shall be a participating provider for all care, services, or supplies furnished to an active duty member of the uniformed services for which the active duty member is entitled under 10 U.S.C. 1074(c). As a participating provider for active duty members, the CHAMPUS authorized hospital shall provide such care, services, and supplies in accordance with the payment rules of § 199.16 of this part. The failure of any CHAMPUS participating hospital to be a participating provider for any active duty member subjects the hospital to termination of the hospital's status as a CHAMPUS authorized provider for failure to meet the qualifications established by this part.
(11)
Balance billing limits
—(i)
In general.
Individual providers including providers salaried or under contract by an institutional provider and other providers who are not participating providers may not balance bill a beneficiary an amount that exceeds the applicable balance billing limit. The balance billing limit shall be the same percentage as the Medicare limiting charge percentage for nonparticipating practitioners and suppliers.
(ii)
Waiver.
The balance billing limit may be waived by the Director, OCHAMPUS on a case-by-case basis if requested by a CHAMPUS beneficiary. A decision by the Director, OCHAMPUS to waive or not waive the limit in any particular case is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of § 199.10.
(iii)
Compliance.
Failure to comply with the balance billing limit shall be considered abuse and/or fraud and grounds of exclusion or suspension of the provider under § 199.9.
(12)
Medical records.
CHAMPUS-authorized provider organizations and individuals providing clinical services shall maintain adequate clinical records to substantiate that specific care was actually furnished, was medically necessary, and appropriate, and identify(ies) the individual(s) who provided the care. This applies whether the care is inpatient or outpatient. The minimum requirements for medical record documentation are set forth by all of the following:
(i) The cognizant state licensing authority;
(ii) The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, or the appropriate Qualified Accreditation Organization as defined in § 199.2;
(iii) Standards of practice established by national medical organizations; and
(iv) This part.
(13)
Participation agreements.
A participation agreement otherwise required by this part shall include, in part, all of the following provisions requiring that the provider shall:

(15)
Exclusion.
Regardless of any provision in this section, a provider who is suspended, excluded, or terminated under § 199.9 of this part is specifically excluded as an authorized CHAMPUS provider.
(b)
Institutional providers
—(1)
General.
Institutional providers are those providers who bill for services in the name of an organizational entity (such as hospital and skilled nursing facility), rather than in the name of a person. The term “institutional provider” does not include professional corporations or associations qualifying as a domestic corporation under § 301.7701-5 of the Internal Revenue Service Regulations nor does it include other corporations that provide principally professional services. Institutional providers may provide medical services and supplies on either an inpatient or outpatient basis.
(i)
Preauthorization.
Preauthorization may be required by the Director, OCHAMPUS for any health care service for which payment is sought under CHAMPUS. (See §§ 199.4 and 199.15 for further information on preauthorization requirements.)
(ii) Billing practices.
(A) Each institutional billing, including those institutions subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based reimbursement method or a CHAMPUS-determined all-inclusive rate reimbursement method, must be itemized fully and sufficiently descriptive for the CHAMPUS to make a determination of benefits.
(B) Institutional claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based reimbursement method or a CHAMPUS-determined all-inclusive rate reimbursement method, may be submitted only after the beneficiary has been discharged or transferred from the institutional provider's facility or program.
(C) Institutional claims for Residential Treatment Centers and all other institutional providers, except those listed in (B) above, should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days.
(2)
Nondiscrimination policy.
Except as provided below, payment may not be made for inpatient or outpatient care provided and billed by an institutional provider found by the Federal Government to practice discrimination in the admission of patients to its services on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Reimbursement may not be made to a beneficiary who pays for care provided by such a facility and submits a claim for reimbursement. In the following circumstances, the Secretary of Defense, or a designee, may authorize payment for care obtained in an ineligible facility:
(i)
Emergency care.
Emergency inpatient or outpatient care.
(ii)
Care rendered before finding of a violation.
Care initiated before a finding of a violation and which continues after such violation when it is determined that a change in the treatment facility would be detrimental to the health of the patient, and the attending physician so certifies.
(iii)
Other facility not available.
Care provided in an ineligible facility because an eligible facility is not available within a reasonable distance.
(3)
Procedures for qualifying as a CHAMPUS-approved institutional provider.
General and special hospitals otherwise meeting the qualifications outlined in paragraphs (b)(4) (i), (ii), and (iii), of this section are not required to request CHAMPUS approval formally.
(i)
JCAH accreditation status.
Each CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary shall keep informed as to the current JCAH accreditation status of all hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in its area; and the provider's status under Medicare, particularly with regard to compliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d(1)). The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall specifically approve all other authorized institutional providers providing services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. At the discretion of the Director, OCHAMPUS, any facility that is certified and participating as a provider of services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare), may be deemed to meet CHAMPUS requirements. The facility must be providing a type and level of service that is authorized by this part.
(ii)
Required to comply with criteria.
Facilities seeking CHAMPUS approval will be expected to comply with appropriate criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. They also are required to complete and submit CHAMPUS Form 200, “Required Information, Facility Determination Instructions,” and provide such additional information as may be requested by OCHAMPUS. An onsite evaluation, either scheduled or unscheduled, may be conducted at the discretion of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. The final determination regarding approval, reapproval, or disapproval of a facility will be provided in writing to the facility and the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary.
(iii)
Notice of peer review rights.
All health care facilities subject to the DRG-based payment system shall provide CHAMPUS beneficiaries, upon admission, with information about peer review including their appeal rights. The notices shall be in a form specified by the Director, OCHAMPUS.
(iv)
Surveying of facilities.
The surveying of newly established institutional providers and the periodic resurveying of all authorized institutional providers is a continuing process conducted by OCHAMPUS.
(v)
Institutions not in compliance with CHAMPUS standards.
If a determination is made that an institution is not in compliance with one or more of the standards applicable to its specific category of institution, CHAMPUS shall take immediate steps to bring about compliance or terminate the approval as an authorized institution in accordance with § 199.9(f)(2).
(vi)
Participation agreements required for some hospitals which are not Medicare-participating.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (B)(3), a hospital which is subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system but which is not a Medicare-participating hospital must request and sign an agreement with OCHAMPUS. By signing the agreement, the hospital agrees to participate on all CHAMPUS inpatient claims and accept the requirements for a participating provider as contained in paragraph (a)(8) of § 199.6. Failure to sign such an agreement shall disqualify such hospital as a CHAMPUS-approved institutional provider.
(4)
Categories of institutional providers.
The following categories of institutional providers may be reimbursed by CHAMPUS for services provided CHAMPUS beneficiaries subject to any and all definitions, conditions, limitation, and exclusions specified or enumerated in this part.
(i)
Hospitals, acute care, general and special.
An institution that provides inpatient services, that also may provide outpatient services (including clinical and ambulatory surgical services), and that:
(A) Is engaged primarily in providing to inpatients, by or under the supervision of physicians, diagnostic and therapeutic services for the medical or surgical diagnosis and treatment of illness, injury, or bodily malfunction (including maternity).
(B) Maintains clinical records on all inpatients (and outpatients if the facility operates an outpatient department or emergency room).
(C) Has bylaws in effect with respect to its operations and medical staff.
(D) Has a requirement that every patient be under the care of a physician.
(E) Provides 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered professional nurse on duty at all times.
(F) Has in effect a hospital utilization review plan that is operational and functioning.
(G) In the case of an institution in a state in which state or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals, the hospital:
(
1
) Is licensed pursuant to such law, or
(
2
) Is approved by the agency of such state or locality responsible for licensing hospitals as meeting the standards established for such licensing.
(H) Has in effect an operating plan and budget.
(I) Is accredited by the JCAH or meets such other requirements as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Transportation, or the Secretary of Defense finds necessary in the interest of the health and safety of patients who are admitted to and furnished services in the institution.
(ii)
Organ transplant centers.
To obtain TRICARE approval as an organ transplant center, the center must be a Medicare approved transplant center or meet the criteria as established by the Executive Director, TMA, or a designee.
(iii)
Organ transplant consortia.
TRICARE shall approve individual pediatric organ transplant centers that meet the criteria established by the Executive Director, TMA, or a designee.
(iv)
Hospitals, psychiatric.
A psychiatric hospital is an institution which is engaged primarily in providing services to inpatients for the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.
(A) There are two major categories of psychiatric hospitals:
(
1
) The private psychiatric hospital category includes both proprietary and the not-for-profit nongovernmental institutions.
(
2
) The second category is those psychiatric hospitals that are controlled, financed, and operated by departments or agencies of the local, state, or Federal Government and always are operated on a not-for-profit basis.
(B) In order for the services of a psychiatric hospital to be covered, the hospital shall comply with the provisions outlined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. All psychiatric hospitals shall be accredited under an accrediting organization approved by the Director, in order for their services to be cost-shared under CHAMPUS. In the case of those psychiatric hospitals that are not accredited because they have
not been in operation a sufficient period of time to be eligible to request an accreditation survey, the Director, or a designee, may grant temporary approval if the hospital is certified and participating under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare, Part A). This temporary approval expires 12 months from the date on which the psychiatric hospital first becomes eligible to request an accreditation survey by an accrediting organization approved by the Director.
(C) Factors to be considered in determining whether CHAMPUS will cost-share care provided in a psychiatric hospital include, but are not limited to, the following considerations:
(
1
) Is the prognosis of the patient such that care provided will lead to resolution or remission of the mental illness to the degree that the patient is of no danger to others, can perform routine daily activities, and can be expected to function reasonably outside the inpatient setting?
(
2
) Can the services being provided be provided more economically in another facility or on an outpatient basis?
(
3
) Are the charges reasonable?
(
4
) Is the care primarily custodial or domiciliary? (Custodial or domiciliary care of the permanently mentally ill or retarded is not a benefit under the Basic Program.)
(D) Although psychiatric hospitals are accredited under an accrediting organization approved by Director, their medical records must be maintained in accordance with accrediting organization's current standards manual, along with the requirements set forth in § 199.7(b)(3). The hospital is responsible for assuring that patient services and all treatment are accurately documented and completed in a timely manner.
(v)
Long Term Care Hospital (LTCH).
LTCHs must meet all the criteria for classification as an LTCH under 42 CFR part 412, subpart O, as well as all of the requirements of this part in order to be considered an authorized LTCH under the TRICARE program.
(A) In order for the services of LTCHs to be covered, the hospitals must comply with the provisions outlined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. In addition, in order for services provided by such hospitals to be covered by TRICARE, they must be primarily for the treatment of the presenting illness.
(B) Custodial or domiciliary care is not coverable under TRICARE, even if rendered in an otherwise authorized LTCH.
(C) The controlling factor in determining whether a beneficiary's stay in a LTCH is coverable by TRICARE is the level of professional care, supervision, and skilled nursing care that the beneficiary requires, in addition to the diagnosis, type of condition, or degree of functional limitations. The type and level of medical services required or rendered is controlling for purposes of extending TRICARE benefits; not the type of provider or condition of the beneficiary.
(vi)
Skilled nursing facility.
A skilled nursing facility is an institution (or a distinct part of an institution) that is engaged primarily in providing to inpatients medically necessary skilled nursing care, which is other than a nursing home or intermediate facility, and which:
(A) Has policies that are developed with the advice of (and with provisions for review on a periodic basis by) a group of professionals, including one or more physicians and one or more registered nurses, to govern the skilled nursing care and related medical services it provides.
(B) Has a physician, a registered nurse, or a medical staff responsible for the execution of such policies.
(C) Has a requirement that the medical care of each patient must be under the supervision of a physician, and provides for having a physician available to furnish necessary medical care in case of an emergency.
(D) Maintains clinical records on all patients.
(E) Provides 24-hour skilled nursing service that is sufficient to meet nursing needs in accordance with the policies developed as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, and has at least one registered professional nurse employed full-time.
(F) Provides appropriate methods and procedures for the dispensing and administering of drugs and biologicals.
(G) Has in effect a utilization review plan that is operational and functioning.
(H) In the case of an institution in a state in which state or applicable local law provides for the licensing of this type facility, the institution:
(
1
) Is licensed pursuant to such law, or
(
2
) Is approved by the agency of such state or locality responsible for licensing such institutions as meeting the standards established for such licensing.
(I) Has in effect an operating plan and budget.
(J) Meets such provisions of the most current edition of the Life Safety Code
8
as are applicable to nursing facilities; except that if the Secretary of Health and Human Services has waived, for such periods, as deemed appropriate, specific provisions of such code which, if rigidly applied, would result in unreasonable hardship upon a nursing facility.

Compiled and published by the National Fire Protection Association, Batterymarch Park, Quincy, Massachusetts 02269.
(K) Is an authorized provider under the Medicare program, and meets the requirements of Title 18 of the social Security Act, sections 1819(a), (b), (c), and (d) (42 U.S.C. 1395i-3(a)-(d)).

# Note:
If a pediatric SNF is certified by Medicaid, it will be considered to meet the Medicare certification requirement in order to be an authorized provider under TRICARE.
(vii)
Residential treatment centers.
This paragraph (b)(4)(vii) establishes the definition of and eligibility standards and requirements for residential treatment centers (RTCs).
(A)
Organization and administration
—(
1
)
Definition.
A Residential Treatment Center (RTC) is a facility or a distinct part of a facility that provides to beneficiaries under 21 years of age a medically supervised, interdisciplinary program of mental health treatment. An RTC is appropriate for patients whose predominant symptom presentation is essentially stabilized, although not resolved, and who have persistent dysfunction in major life areas. Residential treatment may be complemented by family therapy and case management for community based resources. Discharge planning should support transitional care for the patient and family, to include resources available in the geographic area where the patient will be residing. The extent and pervasiveness of the patient's problems require a protected and highly structured therapeutic environment. Residential treatment is differentiated from:
(
i
) Acute psychiatric care, which requires medical treatment and 24-hour availability of a fullrange of diagnostic and therapeutic services to establish and implement an effective plan of care which will reverse life-threatening and/or severely incapacitating symptoms;
(
ii
) Partial hospitalization, which provides a less than 24-hour-per-day, seven-day-per-week treatment program for patients who continue to exhibit psychiatric problems but can function with support in some of the major life areas;
(
iii
) A group home, which is a professionally directed living arrangement with the availability of psychiatric consultation and treatment for patients with significant family dysfunction and/or chronic but stable psychiatric disturbances;
(
iv
) Therapeutic school, which is an educational program supplemented by psychological and psychiatric services;
(
v
) Facilities that treat patients with a primary diagnosis of substance use disorder; and
(
vi
) Facilities providing care for patients with a primary diagnosis of mental retardation or developmental disability.
(
2
)
Eligibility.
(
i
) In order to qualify as a TRICARE authorized provider, every RTC must meet the minimum basic standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(4)(vii)(A) through (C) of this section, and as well as such additional elaborative criteria and standards as the Director determines are necessary to implement the basic standards.
(
ii
) To qualify as a TRICARE authorized provider, the facility is required to be licensed and operate in substantial compliance with state and federal regulations.
(
iii
) The facility is currently accredited by an accrediting organization approved by the Director.
(
iv
) The facility has a written participation agreement with OCHAMPUS. The RTC is not a CHAMPUS-authorized provider and CHAMPUS benefits are not paid for services provided until the date upon which a participation agreement is signed by the Director.
(B) Participation agreement requirements. In addition to other requirements set forth in this paragraph (b)(4)(vii), for the services of an RTC to be authorized, the RTC shall have entered into a Participation Agreement with OCHAMPUS. The period of a participation agreement shall be specified in the agreement, and will generally be for not more than five years. In addition to review of a facility's application and supporting documentation, an on-site inspection by OCHAMPUS authorized personnel may be required prior to signing a Participation Agreement. Retroactive approval is not given. In addition, the Participation Agreement shall include provisions that the RTC shall, at a minimum:
(
1
) Render residential treatment center inpatient services to eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries in need of such services, in accordance with the participation agreement and CHAMPUS regulation;
(
2
) Accept payment for its services based upon the methodology provided in § 199.14(f) or such other method as determined by the Director;
(
3
) Accept the CHAMPUS all-inclusive per diem rate as payment in full and collect from the CHAMPUS beneficiary or the family of the CHAMPUS beneficiary only those amounts that represent the beneficiary's liability, as defined in § 199.4, and charges for services and supplies that are not a benefit of CHAMPUS;
(
4
) Make all reasonable efforts acceptable to the Director, to collect those amounts, which represents the beneficiary's liability, as defined in § 199.4;
(
5
) Comply with the provisions of § 199.8, and submit claims first to all health insurance coverage to which the beneficiary is entitled that is primary to CHAMPUS;
(
6
) Submit claims for services provided to CHAMPUS beneficiaries at least every 30 days (except to the extent a delay is necessitated by efforts to first collect from other health insurance). If claims are not submitted at least every 30 days, the RTC agrees not to bill the beneficiary or the beneficiary's family for any amounts disallowed by CHAMPUS;
(
7
) Certify that:
(
i
) It is and will remain in compliance with the TRICARE standards and provisions of paragraph (b)(4)(vii) of this section establishing standards for Residential Treatment Centers; and
(
ii
) It will maintain compliance with the CHAMPUS Standards for Residential Treatment Centers Serving Children and Adolescents with Mental Disorders, as issued by the Director, except for any such standards regarding which the facility notifies the Director that it is not in compliance.
(
8
) Designate an individual who will act as liaison for CHAMPUS inquiries. The RTC shall inform OCHAMPUS in writing of the designated individual;
(
9
) Furnish OCHAMPUS, as requested by OCHAMPUS, with cost data certified by an independent accounting firm or other agency as authorized by the Director, OCHAMPUS;
(
10
) Comply with all requirements of this section applicable to institutional providers generally concerning accreditation requirements, preauthorization, concurrent care review, claims processing, beneficiary liability, double coverage, utilization and quality review, and other matters;
(
11
) Grant the Director, or designee, the right to conduct quality assurance audits or accounting audits with full access to patients and records (including records relating to patients who are not CHAMPUS beneficiaries) to determine the quality and cost-effectiveness of care rendered. The audits may be conducted on a scheduled or unscheduled (unannounced) basis. This right to audit/review includes, but is not limited to:
(
i
) Examination of fiscal and all other records of the RTC which would confirm compliance with the participation agreement and designation as a TRICARE authorized RTC;
(
ii
) Conducting such audits of RTC records including clinical, financial, and census records, as may be necessary to determine the nature of the services being provided, and the basis
for charges and claims against the United States for services provided CHAMPUS beneficiaries;
(
iii
) Examining reports of evaluations and inspections conducted by federal, state and local government, and private agencies and organizations;
(
iv
) Conducting on-site inspections of the facilities of the RTC and interviewing employees, members of the staff, contractors, board members, volunteers, and patients, as required;
(
v
) Audits conducted by the United States Government Accountability Office.
(C)
Other requirements applicable to RTCs.
(
1
) Even though an RTC may qualify as a TRICARE authorized provider and may have entered into a participation agreement with CHAMPUS, payment by CHAMPUS for particular services provided is contingent upon the RTC also meeting all conditions set forth in § 199.4 especially all requirements of § 199.4(b)(4).
(
2
) The RTC shall provide inpatient services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries in the same manner it provides inpatient services to all other patients. The RTC may not discriminate against CHAMPUS beneficiaries in any manner, including admission practices, placement in special or separate wings or rooms, or provisions of special or limited treatment.
(
3
) The RTC shall assure that all certifications and information provided to the Director, incident to the process of obtaining and retaining authorized provider status is accurate and that it has no material errors or omissions. In the case of any misrepresentations, whether by inaccurate information being provided or material facts withheld, authorized status will be denied or terminated, and the RTC will be ineligible for consideration for authorized provider status for a two year period.
(viii)
Christian Science sanatoriums.
The services obtained in Christian Science sanatoriums are covered by CHAMPUS as inpatient care. To qualify for coverage, the sanatorium either must be operated by, or be listed and certified by the First Church of Christ, Scientist.
(ix)
Infirmaries.
Infirmaries are facilities operated by student health departments of colleges and universities to provide inpatient or outpatient care to enrolled students. Charges for care provided by such facilities will not be cost-shared by CHAMPUS if the student would not be charged in the absence of CHAMPUS, or if student is covered by a mandatory student health insurance plan, in which enrollment is required as a part of the student's school registration and the charges by the college or university include a premium for the student health insurance coverage. CHAMPUS will cost-share only if enrollment in the student health program or health insurance plan is voluntary.

# Note:
An infirmary in a boarding school also may qualify under this provision, subject to review and approval by the Director, OCHAMPUS or a designee.
(x)
Other special institution providers.
(A)
General.
(
1
) Care provided by certain special institutional providers (on either an inpatient or outpatient basis), may be cost-shared by CHAMPUS under specified circumstances and only if the provider is specifically identified in paragraph (b)(4)(x) of this section.
(
i
) The course of treatment is prescribed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy.
(
ii
) The patient is under the supervision of a physician during the entire course of the inpatient admission or the outpatient treatment.
(
iii
) The type and level of care and service rendered by the institution are otherwise authorized by this part.
(
iv
) The facility meets all licensing or other certification requirements that are extant in the jurisdiction in which the facility is located geographically.
(
v
) Is other than a nursing home, intermediate care facility, home for the aged, halfway house, or other similar institution.
(
vi
) Is accredited by the JCAH or other CHAMPUS-approved accreditation organization, if an appropriate accreditation program for the given type of facility is available. As future accreditation programs are developed to cover emerging specialized treatment programs, such accreditation will be a prerequisite to coverage by CHAMPUS for services provided by such facilities.
(
2
) To ensure that CHAMPUS beneficiaries are provided quality care at a reasonable cost when treated by a special institutional provider, the Director, OCHAMPUS may:
(
i
) Require prior approval of all admissions to special institutional providers.
(
ii
) Set appropriate standards for special institutional providers in addition to or in the absence of JCAHO accreditation.
(
iii
) Monitor facility operations and treatment programs on a continuing basis and conduct onsite inspections on a scheduled and unscheduled basis.
(
iv
) Negotiate agreements of participation.
(
v
) Terminate approval of a case when it is ascertained that a departure from the facts upon which the admission was based originally has occurred.
(
vi
) Declare a special institutional provider not eligible for CHAMPUS payment if that facility has been found to have engaged in fraudulent or deceptive practices.
(
3
) In general, the following disclaimers apply to treatment by special institutional providers:
(
i
) Just because one period or episode of treatment by a facility has been covered by CHAMPUS may not be construed to mean that later episodes of care by the same or similar facility will be covered automatically.
(
ii
) The fact that one case has been authorized for treatment by a specific facility or similar type of facility may not be construed to mean that similar cases or later periods of treatment will be extended CHAMPUS benefits automatically.
(B)
Types of providers.
The following is a list of facilities that have been designated specifically as special institutional providers.
(
1
)
Ambulatory surgical centers
(
ASC).
ASCs must meet all criteria for classification as an Ambulatory Surgical Center under 42 CFR part 416, as well as all of the requirements of this part, in order to be considered an authorized ASC under the TRICARE program. Care provided by an authorized TRICARE ASC may be cost-shared under the following circumstances:
(
i
) A childbirth procedure provided by a CHAMPUS-approved ASC shall not be cost-shared by CHAMPUS unless the surgical center is also a CHAMPUS-approved birthing center institutional provider as established by the birthing center provider certification requirement of this part, and then reimbursement of covered maternity care and childbirth services shall be subject to § 199.14(e).
(
ii
) ASCs must demonstrate they have a valid participation agreement with Medicare, except as provided under paragraph (b)(4)(x)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section. In addition, in order to be considered an authorized TRICARE provider, ASCs must accept the requirements for a participating provider under paragraph (a)(13) of this section and must also enter into a participation agreement with TRICARE which includes a specific “hold harmless” provision under which the facility will agree not to bill the patient for services not on the Medicare ASC procedures list unless, the patient is advised in writing that the non-listed procedure is not covered by TRICARE and the patient agrees, in advance in writing, to be financially liable for the non-covered procedure.
(
iii
) ASCs that do not have an agreement with Medicare due to the nature of the patients they treat (
e.g.,
pediatric patients) shall be accredited by the Joint Commission, the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc. (AAAHC), or such other accreditation as authorized by the Director, DHA and published in the implementing instructions. Additionally, these facilities must enter into participation agreements with TRICARE, including the hold harmless provisions under paragraph (b)(4)(x)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section, and accept the requirements for a participating provider under paragraph (a)(13) of this section in order to be an authorized TRICARE provider.

This paragraph (b)(4)(xii) establishes the definition of and eligibility standards and requirements for psychiatric and substance use disorder partial hospitalization programs.
(A)
Organization and administration
—(

)
Definition.
Partial hospitalization is defined as a time-limited, ambulatory, active treatment program that offers therapeutically intensive, coordinated, and structured clinical services within a stable therapeutic milieu. Partial hospitalization programs serve patients who exhibit psychiatric symptoms, disturbances of conduct, and decompensating conditions affecting mental health. Partial hospitalization is appropriate for those whose psychiatric and addiction-related symptoms or concomitant physical and emotional/behavioral problems can be managed outside the hospital for defined periods of time with support in one or more of the major life areas. A partial hospitalization program for the treatment of substance use disorders is an addiction-focused service that provides active treatment to children and adolescents, or adults aged 18 and over.
(
2
)
Eligibility.
(
i
) To qualify as a TRICARE authorized provider, every partial hospitalization program must meet minimum basic standards set
forth in paragraphs (b)(4)(xii)(A) through (D) of this section, as well as such additional elaborative criteria and standards as the Director determines are necessary to implement the basic standards. Each partial hospitalization program must be either a distinct part of an otherwise-authorized institutional provider or a free-standing program. Approval of a hospital by TRICARE is sufficient for its partial hospitalization program to be an authorized TRICARE provider. Such hospital-based partial hospitalization programs are not required to be separately authorized by TRICARE.
(
ii
) To be approved as a TRICARE authorized provider, the facility is required to be licensed and operate in substantial compliance with state and federal regulations.
(
iii
) The facility is required to be currently accredited by an accrediting organization approved by the Director. Each PHP authorized to treat substance use disorder must be accredited to provide the level of required treatment by an accreditation body approved by the Director.
(
iv
) The facility is required to have a written participation agreement with OCHAMPUS. The PHP is not a CHAMPUS-authorized provider and CHAMPUS benefits are not paid for services provided until the date upon which a participation agreement is signed by the Director.
(B)
Participation agreement requirements.
In addition to other requirements set forth in this paragraph (b)(4)(xii), in order for the services of a PHP to be authorized, the PHP shall have entered into a Participation Agreement with OCHAMPUS. A single consolidated participation agreement is acceptable for all units of the TRICARE authorized facility granted that all programs meet the requirements of this part. The period of a Participation Agreement shall be specified in the agreement, and will generally be for not more than five years. The PHP shall not be considered to be a CHAMPUS authorized provider and CHAMPUS payments shall not be made for services provided by the PHP until the date the participation agreement is signed by the Director. In addition to review of a facility's application and supporting documentation, an on-site inspection by OCHAMPUS authorized personnel may be required prior to signing a participation agreement. The Participation Agreement shall include at least the following requirements:
(
1
) Render partial hospitalization program services to eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries in need of such services, in accordance with the participation agreement and CHAMPUS regulation.
(
2
) Accept payment for its services based upon the methodology provided in § 199.14, or such other method as determined by the Director;
(
3
) Accept the CHAMPUS all-inclusive per diem rate as payment in full and collect from the CHAMPUS beneficiary or the family of the CHAMPUS beneficiary only those amounts that represent the beneficiary's liability, as defined in § 199.4, and charges for services and supplies that are not a benefit of CHAMPUS;
(
4
) Make all reasonable efforts acceptable to the Director to collect those amounts, which represent the beneficiary's liability, as defined in § 199.4;
(
5

(
6
) Submit claims for services provided to CHAMPUS beneficiaries at least every 30 days (except to the extent a delay is necessitated by efforts to first collect from other health insurance). If claims are not submitted at least every 30 days, the PHP agrees not to bill the beneficiary or the beneficiary's family for any amounts disallowed by CHAMPUS;
(
7
) Certify that:
(
i
) It is and will remain in compliance with the TRICARE standards and provisions of paragraph (b)(4)(xii) of this section establishing standards for psychiatric and substance use disorder partial hospitalization programs; and
(
ii
) It will maintain compliance with the CHAMPUS Standards for Psychiatric Substance Use Disorder Partial Hospitalization Programs, as issued by the Director, except for any such standards regarding which the facility notifies the Director, or designee, that it is not in compliance.
(
8
) Designate an individual who will act as liaison for CHAMPUS inquiries. The PHP shall inform the Director, or designee, in writing of the designated individual;
(
9
) Furnish OCHAMPUS, as requested by OCHAMPUS, with cost data certified by an independent accounting firm or other agency as authorized by the Director;
(
10

The audits may be conducted on a scheduled or unscheduled (unannounced) basis. This right to audit/review includes, but is not limited to:
(
i
) Examination of fiscal and all other records of the PHP which would confirm compliance with the participation agreement and designation as a TRICARE authorized PHP provider;
(
ii
) Conducting such audits of PHP records including clinical, financial, and census records, as may be necessary to determine the nature of the services being provided, and the basis for charges and claims against the United States for services provided CHAMPUS beneficiaries;

(
iv
) Conducting on-site inspections of the facilities of the PHP and interviewing employees, members of the staff, contractors, board members, volunteers, and patients, as required;
(
v
) Audits conducted by the United States General Account Office.
(C)
Other requirements applicable to PHPs.
(
1
) Even though a PHP may qualify as a TRICARE authorized provider and may have entered into a participation agreement with CHAMPUS, payment by CHAMPUS for particular services provided is contingent upon the PHP also meeting all conditions set forth in § 199.4.
(
2
) The PHP may not discriminate against CHAMPUS beneficiaries in any manner, including admission practices, placement in special or separate wings or rooms, or provisions of special or limited treatment.
(
3
) The PHP shall assure that all certifications and information provided to the Director incident to the process of obtaining and retaining authorized provider status is accurate and that is has no material errors or omissions. In the case of any misrepresentations, whether by inaccurate information being provided or material facts withheld, authorized provider status will be denied or terminated, and the PHP will be ineligible for consideration for authorized provider status for a two year period.
(xiii)
Hospice programs.
Hospice programs must be Medicare approved and meet all Medicare conditions of participation (42 CFR part 418) in relation to CHAMPUS patients in order to receive payment under the CHAMPUS program. A hospice program may be found to be out of compliance with a particular Medicare condition of participation and still participate in the CHAMPUS as long as the hospice is allowed continued participation in Medicare while the condition of noncompliance is being corrected. The hospice program can be either a public agency or private organization (or a subdivision thereof) which:
(A) Is primarily engaged in providing the care and services described under § 199.4(e)(19) and makes such services available on a 24-hour basis.
(B) Provides bereavement counseling for the immediate family or terminally ill individuals.
(C) Provides for such care and services in individuals' homes, on an outpatient basis, and on a short-term inpatient basis, directly or under arrangements made by the hospice program, except that the agency or organization must:

Organization and administration.
(
1
)
Definition.
Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) are defined in § 199.2. Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) are organized, ambulatory, addiction treatment services for patients with an opioid use disorder. OTPs have the capacity to provide daily direct administration of medications without the prescribing of medications. Medication supplies for patients to take outside of OTPs originate from within OTPs. OTPs offer medication assisted treatment, patient-centered, recovery-oriented individualized treatment through addiction counseling, mental health therapy, case management, and health education.
(
2
)
Eligibility.
(
i
) Every free-standing Opioid Treatment Program must be accredited by an accrediting organization recognized by Director, under the current standards of an accrediting organization, as well as meet additional elaborative criteria and standards as
the Director determines are necessary to implement the basic standards. OTPs adhere to requirements of the Department of Health and Human Services' 42 CFR part 8, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, and the Drug Enforcement Agency. OTPs must be either a distinct part of an otherwise authorized institutional provider or a free-standing program. Approval of hospitals by TRICARE is sufficient for their OTPs to be authorized TRICARE providers. Such hospital-based OTPs, if certified under 42 CFR 8, are not required to be separately authorized by TRICARE.
(
ii
) To qualify as a TRICARE authorized provider, OTPs are required to be licensed and operate in substantial compliance with state and federal regulations.
(
iii
) OTPs have a written participation agreement with OCHAMPUS. OTPs are not considered a TRICARE authorized provider, and CHAMPUS benefits are not paid for services provided until the date upon which a participation agreement is signed by the Director.
(B) Participation agreement requirements. In addition to other requirements set forth in this paragraph (b)(4)(xix), in order for the services of OTPs to be authorized, OTPs shall have entered into a Participation Agreement with TRICARE. A single consolidated participation agreement is acceptable for all units of a TRICARE authorized facility. The period of a Participation Agreement shall be specified in the agreement, and will generally be for not more than five years. In addition to review of a facility's application and supporting documentation, an on-site inspection by DHA authorized personnel may be required prior to signing a participation agreement. The Participation Agreement shall include at least the following requirements:
(
1
) Render services from OTPs to eligible TRICARE beneficiaries in need of such services, in accordance with the participation agreement and TRICARE regulation.
(
2
) Accept payment for its services based upon the methodology provided in § 199.14, or such other method as determined by the Director;
(
3
) Collect from the TRICARE beneficiary or the family of the TRICARE beneficiary only those amounts that represent the beneficiary's liability, as defined in § 199.4, and charges for services and supplies that are not a benefit of TRICARE;
(
4
) Make all reasonable efforts acceptable to the Director to collect those amounts, which represent the beneficiary's liability, as defined in § 199.4;
(
5
) Comply with the provisions of § 199.8, and submit claims first to all health insurance coverage to which the beneficiary is entitled that is primary to TRICARE;
(
6
) Submit claims for services provided to TRICARE beneficiaries at least every 30 days (except to the extent a delay is necessitated by efforts to first collect from other health insurance). If claims are not submitted at least every 30 days, OTPs agree not to bill the beneficiary or the beneficiary's family for any amounts disallowed by TRICARE;
(
7
) Free-standing opioid treatment programs shall certify that:
(
i
) It is and will remain in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(4)(xii) of this section establishing standards for opioid treatment programs;
(
ii
) It will maintain compliance with the TRICARE standards for OTPs, as issued by the Director, except for any such standards regarding which the facility notifies the Director, or a designee, that it is not in compliance.
(
8
) Designate an individual who will act as liaison for TRICARE inquiries. OTPs shall inform TRICARE, or a designee, in writing of the designated individual;
(
9
) Furnish TRICARE, or a designee, with cost data, as requested by TRICARE, certified by an independent accounting firm or other agency as authorized by the Director;
(
10
) Comply with all requirements of this section applicable to institutional providers generally concerning accreditation requirements, claims processing, beneficiary liability, double coverage, utilization and quality review, and other matters;
(
11
) Grant the Director, or designee, the right to conduct quality assurance audits or accounting audits with full access to patients and records (including records relating to patients who are not TRICARE beneficiaries) to determine the quality and cost effectiveness of care rendered. The audits may be conducted on a scheduled or unscheduled (unannounced) basis. This right to audit/review includes, but is not limited to:
(
i
) Examination of fiscal and all other records of OTPs which would confirm compliance with the participation agreement and designation as an authorized TRICARE provider;
(
ii
) Conducting such audits of OTPs' records including clinical, financial, and census records, as may be necessary to determine the nature of the services being provided, and the basis for charges and claims against the United States for services provided TRICARE beneficiaries;
(
iii
) Examining reports of evaluations and inspections conducted by federal, state and local government, and private agencies and organizations.
(C)
Other requirements applicable to OTPs.
(
1
) Even though OTPs may qualify as a TRICARE authorized provider and may have entered into a participation agreement with CHAMPUS, payment by CHAMPUS for particular services provided is contingent upon OTPs also meeting all conditions set forth in § 199.4.
(
2
) OTPs may not discriminate against CHAMPUS beneficiaries in any manner, including admission practices or provisions of special or limited treatment.
(
3
) OTPs shall assure that all certifications and information provided to the Director incident to the process of obtaining and retaining authorized provider status is accurate and that is has no material errors or omissions. In the case of any misrepresentations, whether by inaccurate information being provided or material facts withheld, authorized provider status will be denied or terminated, and OTPs will be ineligible for consideration for authorized provider status for a two year period.
(xx)
Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF).
IRFs must meet all the criteria for classification as an IRF under 42 CFR part 412, subpart B, and meet all applicable requirements established in this part in order to be considered an authorized IRF under the TRICARE program.
(A) In order for the services of inpatient rehabilitation facilities to be covered, the facility must comply with the provisions outlined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. In addition, in order for services provided by these facilities to be covered by TRICARE, they must be primarily for the treatment of the presenting illness.
(B) Custodial or domiciliary care is not coverable under TRICARE, even if rendered in an otherwise authorized inpatient rehabilitation facility.
(C) The controlling factor in determining whether a beneficiary's stay in an inpatient rehabilitation facility is coverable by TRICARE is the level of professional care, supervision, and skilled nursing care that the beneficiary requires, in addition to the diagnosis, type of condition, or degree of functional limitations. The type and level of medical services required or rendered is controlling for purposes of extending TRICARE benefits; not the type of provider or condition of the beneficiary.
(xxi)
Freestanding End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) facilities.
Freestanding ESRD facilities must be Medicare certified and meet all Medicare conditions for coverage as provided in 42 CFR part 494, and be classified as freestanding ESRD facilities by Medicare, in order to be approved as TRICARE-authorized institutional providers and receive payment under the TRICARE program. State licensing are not required in cases of a freestanding ESRD facility located in a State that does not license such facilities. Freestanding ESRD facilities are not hospital-affiliated nor hospital-based and are reimbursed based on the payment methodology established in § 199.14(c). Freestanding ESRD facilities render outpatient hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis services in the ESRD facility or in a patient's home for the treatment of ESRD and acute kidney injury (AKI).
(c)
Individual professional providers of care
—(1)
General
—(i)
Purpose.
This individual professional provider class is established to accommodate individuals
who are recognized by 10 U.S.C. 1079(a) as authorized to assess or diagnose illness, injury, or bodily malfunction as a prerequisite for CHAMPUS cost-share of otherwise allowable related preventive or treatment services or supplies, and to accommodate such other qualified individuals who the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may authorize to render otherwise allowable services essential to the efficient implementation of a plan-of-care established and managed by a 10 U.S.C. 1079(a) authorized professional.
(ii)
Professional corporation affiliation or association membership permitted.
Paragraph (c) of this section applies to those individual health care professionals who have formed a professional corporation or association pursuant to applicable state laws. Such a professional corporation or association may file claims on behalf of a CHAMPUS-authorized individual professional provider and be the payee for any payment resulting from such claims when the CHAMPUS-authorized individual certifies to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, in writing that the professional corporation or association is acting on the authorized individual's behalf.
(iii)
Scope of practice limitation.
For CHAMPUS cost-sharing to be authorized, otherwise allowable services provided by a CHAMPUS-authorized individual professional provider shall be within the scope of the individual's license as regulated by the applicable state practice act of the state where the individual rendered the service to the CHAMPUS beneficiary or shall be within the scope of the test which was the basis for the individual's qualifying certification.
(iv)
Employee status exclusion.
An individual employed directly, or indirectly by contract, by an individual or entity to render professional services otherwise allowable by this part is excluded from provider status as established by this paragraph (c) for the duration of each employment.
(v)
Training status exclusion.
Individual health care professionals who are allowed to render health care services only under direct and ongoing supervision as training to be credited towards earning a clinical academic degree or other clinical credential required for the individual to practice independently are excluded from provider status as established by this paragraph (c) for the duration of such training.
(2)
Conditions of authorization
—(i)
Professional license requirement.
The individual must be currently licensed to render professional health care services in each state in which the individual renders services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. Such license is required when a specific state provides, but does not require, license for a specific category of individual professional provider. The license must be at full clinical practice level to meet this requirement. A temporary license at the full clinical practice level is acceptable.
(ii)
Professional certification requirement.
When a state does not license a specific category of individual professional, certification by a Qualified Accreditation Organization, as defined in § 199.2, is required. Certification must be at full clinical practice level. A temporary certification at the full clinical practice level is acceptable.
(iii)
Education, training and experience requirement.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may establish for each category or type of provider allowed by this paragraph (c) specific education, training, and experience requirements as necessary to promote the delivery of services by fully qualified individuals.
(iv)
Physician referral and supervision.
When physician referral and supervision is a prerequisite for CHAMPUS cost-sharing of the services of a provider authorized under this paragraph (c), such referral and supervision means that the physicians must actually see the patient to evaluate and diagnose the condition to be treated prior to referring the beneficiary to another provider and that the referring physician provides ongoing oversight of the course of referral related treatment throughout the period during which the beneficiary is being treated in response to the referral. Written contemporaneous documentation of the referring physician's basis for referral and ongoing communication between the referring and treating provider regarding the oversight of the treatment rendered as a result of the referral must
meet all requirements for medical records established by this part. Referring physician supervision does not require physical location on the premises of the treating provider or at the site of treatment.
(v) Subject to section 1079(a) of title 10, U.S.C., chapter 55, a physician or other health care practitioner who is eligible to receive reimbursement for services provided under Medicare (as defined in section 1086(d)(3)(C) of title 10 U.S.C., chapter 55) shall be considered approved to provide medical care authorized under section 1079 and section 1086 of title 10, U.S.C., chapter 55 unless the administering Secretaries have information indicating Medicare, TRICARE, or other Federal health care program integrity violations by the physician or other health care practitioner. Approval is limited to those classes of provider currently considered TRICARE authorized providers as outlined in 32 CFR 199.6. Services and supplies rendered by those providers who are not currently considered authorized providers shall be denied.

) Because of the similarity of the requirements for licensure, certification, experience, and education, a pastoral counselor may elect to be authorized under CHAMPUS as a certified marriage and family therapist, and as such, be subject to all previously defined criteria for the certified marriage and family therapist category, to include acceptance of the CHAMPUS determined allowable charge as payment in full, except for applicable deductibles and cost-shares (i.e., balance billing of a beneficiary above the allowable charge is prohibited; may not bill beneficiary for noncovered care). The pastoral counselor must also agree to enter into the same participation agreement as a certified marriage and family therapist with the Office of CHAMPUS within which the pastoral counselor agrees to all provisions including licensure, national association membership and conditions upon termination, outlined above for certified marriage and family therapist.

# Note:
No dual status will be recognized by the Office of CHAMPUS. Pastoral counselors must elect to become one of the categories of extramedical CHAMPUS provides specified above. Once authorized as either a pastoral counselor, or a certified marriage and family therapist, claims review and reimbursement will be in accordance with the criteria established for the elected provider category.
(C)
Supervised mental health counselor.
For the purposes of TRICARE, a supervised mental health counselor is an individual who does not meet the requirements of a TRICARE certified mental health counselor in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(N) of this section, but meets all of the following requirements and conditions of practice:
(
1
) Minimum of a master's degree in mental health counseling or allied mental health field from a regionally accredited institution; and
(
2
) Two years of post-masters experience which includes 3,000 hours of clinical work and 100 hours of face-to-face supervision; and
(
3
) Is licensed or certified to practice as a mental health counselor by the jurisdiction where practicing (see paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(D) of this section for more specific information); and
(
4
) May only be reimbursed when:
(
i
) The TRICARE beneficiary is referred for therapy by a physician; and
(
ii
) A physician is providing ongoing oversight and supervision of the therapy being provided; and
(
iii
) The mental health counselor certifies on each claim for reimbursement that a written communication has been made or will be made to the referring physician of the results of the treatment. Such communication will be made at the end of the treatment, or more frequently, as required by the referring physician (refer to § 199.7).
(D) The following additional information applies to each of the above categories of extramedical individual providers:
(
1
) These providers must also be licensed or certified to practice as a certified marriage and family therapist, pastoral counselor or mental health counselor by the jurisdiction where practicing. In jurisdictions that do not provide for licensure or certification, the provider must be certified by or eligible for full clinical membership in the appropriate national professional association that sets standards for the specific profession.
(
2
) Grace period for therapists or counselors in states where licensure/certification is optional. CHAMPUS is providing a grace period for those therapists or counselors who did not obtain optional licensure/certification in their jurisdiction, not realizing it was a CHAMPUS requirement for authorization. The exemption by state law for pastoral counselors may have misled this group into thinking licensure was not required. The same situation may have occurred with the other therapist or counselor categories where licensure was either not mandated by the state or was provided under a more general category such as “professional counselors.” This grace period pertains only to the licensure/certification requirement, applies only to therapists or counselors who are already approved as of October 29, 1990, and only in those areas where the licensure/certification is optional. Any therapist or counselor who is not licensed/certified in the state in which he/she is practicing by August 1, 1991, will be terminated under the provisions of § 199.9. This grace period does not change any of the other existing requirements which remain in effect. During this grace period, membership or proof of eligibility for full clinical membership in a recognized professional association is required for those therapists or counselors who are not licensed or certified by the state. The following organizations are recognized for therapists or counselors at the level indicated: Full clinical member of the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy; membership at the fellow or diplomate level of the American Association of Pastoral Counselors; and membership in the National Academy of Certified Clinical Mental Health Counselors. Acceptable proof of eligibility for membership is a letter from the appropriate certifying organization. This opportunity for delayed certification/licensure is limited to the counselor or therapist category only as the language in all of the other provider categories has been consistent and unmodified from the time each of the other provider categories were added. The grace period does not apply in those states where licensure is mandatory.
(E)
Christian Science practitioners and Christian Science nurses.
CHAMPUS cost-shares the services of Christian Science practitioners and nurses. In order to bill as such, practitioners or nurses must be listed or be eligible for listing in the Christian Science Journal
1
at the time the service is provided.

§ 199.7
Claims submission, review, and payment.
(a)
General.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is responsible for ensuring that benefits under CHAMPUS are paid only to the extent described in this part. Before benefits can be paid, an appropriate claim must be submitted that includes sufficient information as to beneficiary identification, the medical services and supplies provided, and double coverage information, to permit proper, accurate, and timely adjudication of the claim by the CHAMPUS contractor or OCHAMPUS. Providers must be able to document that the care or service shown on the claim was rendered. This section sets forth minimum medical record requirements for verification of services. Subject to such definitions, conditions, limitations, exclusions, and requirements as may be set forth in this part, the following are the CHAMPUS claim filing requirements:
(1)
CHAMPUS identification card required.
A patient shall present his or her applicable CHAMPUS identification card (that is, Uniformed Services identification card) to the authorized provider of care that identifies the patient as an eligible CHAMPUS beneficiary (refer to § 199.3 of this part).
(2)
Claim required.
No benefit may be extended under the Basic Program or Extended Care Health Option (ECHO) without submission of an appropriate, complete and properly executed claim form.
(3)
Responsibility for perfecting claim.
It is the responsibility of the CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor or the authorized provider acting on behalf of the CHAMPUS beneficiary to perfect a claim for submission to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary. Neither a CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary nor OCHAMPUS is authorized to prepare a claim on behalf of a CHAMPUS beneficiary.
(4)
Obtaining appropriate claim form.
CHAMPUS provides specific CHAMPUS forms appropriate for making a claim for benefits for various types of medical services and supplies (such as hospital, physician, or prescription drugs). Claim forms may be obtained from the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary who processes claims for the beneficiary's state of residence, from the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, or from CHAMPUS health benefits advisors (HBAs) located at all Uniformed Services medical facilities.
(5)
Prepayment not required.
A CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor is not required to pay for the medical services or supplies before submitting a claim for benefits.
(6)
Deductible certificate.
If the calendar year outpatient deductible, as defined in § 199.4(f)(2) has been met by a beneficiary or a family through the submission of a claim or claims to a CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary in a geographic location different from the location where a current claim is being submitted, the beneficiary or sponsor must obtain a deductible certificate from the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary where the applicable individual or family calendar year deductible was met. Such deductible certificate must be attached to the current claim being submitted for benefits. Failure to obtain a deductible certificate under such circumstances will result in a second individual or family calendar year deductible being applied. However, this second deductible may be reimbursed once appropriate documentation, as described in this paragraph is supplied to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary applying the second deductible (refer to § 199.4 (f)(2)(i)(F)).
(7)
Nonavailability Statement (DD Form 1251).
In some geographic locations or under certain circumstances, it is necessary for a CHAMPUS beneficiary to determine whether the required medical care can be provided through a Uniformed Services facility. If the required medical care cannot be provided by the Uniformed Services facility, a Nonavailability Statement will be issued. When required (except for emergencies), this Nonavailability Statement must be issued before medical care is obtained from civilian sources. Failure to secure such a statement will waive the beneficiary's rights to benefits under CHAMPUS, subject to appeal to the appropriate hospital commander (or higher medical authority).
(i)
Rules applicable to issuance of Nonavailability Statement.
Appropriate policy guidance may be issued as necessary to prescribe the conditions for issuance and use of a Nonavailability Statement.
(ii)
Beneficiary responsibility.
The beneficiary shall ascertain whether or not he or she resides in a geographic area that requires obtaining a Nonavailability Statement. Information concerning current rules may be obtained from the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary concerned, a CHAMPUS HBA or the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(iii)
Rules in effect at time civilian care is provided apply.
The applicable rules regarding Nonavailability Statements in effect at the time the civilian care is rendered apply in determining whether a Nonavailability Statement is required.
(iv)
Nonavailability Statement must be filed with applicable claim.
When a claim is submitted for CHAMPUS benefits that includes services for which a Nonavailability Statement is required, such statement must be submitted along with the claim form.
(b)
Information required to adjudicate a CHAMPUS claim.
Claims received that are not completed fully and that do not provide the following minimum information may be returned. If enough space is not available on the appropriate claim form, the required information must be attached separately and include the patient's name and address, be dated, and signed.

Patient's identification information.
The following patient identification information must be completed on every CHAMPUS claim form submitted for benefits before a claim will be adjudicated and processed:
(i)
Patient's full name.

The claims must give the name of the individual actually rendering the care, along with the individual's professional status (e.g., M.D., Ph.D., R.N., etc.) and provider number, if the individual signing the claim is not the provider who actually rendered the service. The following information must also be included:
(A) Date each service was rendered.
(B) Procedure code or narrative description of each procedure or service for each date of service.
(C) Individual charge for each item of service or each supply for each date.

(A) An itemized billing showing each item of service or supply provided for each day covered by the claim.

# Note:
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may approve, in writing, an alternative billing procedure for RTCs or other special institutions, in which case the itemized billing requirement may be waived. The particular facility will be aware of such approved alternate billing procedure.
(B) Any absences from a hospital or other authorized institution during a period for which inpatient benefits are being claimed must be identified specifically as to date or dates and provide details on the purpose of the absence. Failure to provide such information will result in denial of benefits and, in an ongoing case, termination of benefits for the inpatient stay at least back to the date of the absence.
(C) For hospitals subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system (see paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(D) of § 199.14), the following information is also required:

(xiii)
Nonparticipating providers.
When the beneficiary or sponsor submits the claim to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary (that is, the provider elects not to participate), an itemized bill from the provider to the beneficiary or sponsor must be attached to the CHAMPUS claim form.
(3)
Medical records/medical documentation.
Medical records are of vital importance in the care and treatment of the patient. Medical records serve as a basis for planning of patient care and for the ongoing evaluation of the patient's treatment and progress. Accurate and timely completion of orders, notes, etc., enable different members of a health care team and subsequent health care providers to have access to relevant data concerning the patient. Appropriate medical records must be maintained in order to accommodate utilization review and to substantiate that billed services were actually rendered.
(i) All care rendered and billed must be appropriately documented in writing. Failure to document the care billed will result in the claim or specific services on the claim being denied CHAMPUS cost-sharing.
(ii) A pattern of failure to adequately document medical care will result in episodes of care being denied CHAMPUS cost-sharing.
(iii) Cursory notes of a generalized nature that do not identify the specific treatment and the patient's response to the treatment are not acceptable.
(iv) The documentation of medical records must be legible and prepared as soon as possible after the care is rendered. Entries should be made when the treatment described is given or the observations to be documented are made. The following are documentation requirements and specific time frames for entry into the medical records:
(A) General requirements for acute medical/surgical services:
(
1
) Admission evaluation report within 24 hours of admission.
(
2
) Completed history and physical examination report within 72 hours of admission.
(
3

# Note:
A pattern of failure to meet the above criteria may result in provider sanctions prescribed under § 199.9.
(4)
Double coverage information.
When the CHAMPUS beneficiary is eligible for medical benefits coverage through another plan, insurance, or program, either private or Government, the following information must be provided:
(i)
Name of other coverage.

Source of double coverage (such as employment, including retirement, private purchase, membership in a group, and law).
(iii)
Employer information.
If source of double coverage is employment, give name and address of employer.
(iv)

Identification number or group number of other coverage.
(5)
Right to additional information.
(i) As a condition precedent to the cost-sharing of benefits under this part or pursuant to a review or audit, whether the review or audit is prospective, concurrent, or retroactive, OCHAMPUS or CHAMPUS contractors may request, and shall be entitled to receive, information from a physician or hospital or other person, institution, or organization (including a local, state, or Federal Government agency) providing services or supplies to the beneficiary for whom claims or requests for approval for benefits are submitted. Such information and records may relate to the attendance, testing, monitoring, examination, diagnosis, treatment, or services and supplies furnished to a beneficiary and, as such, shall be necessary for the accurate and efficient administration of CHAMPUS benefits. This may include requests for copies of all medical records or documentation related to the episode of care. In addition, before a determination on a request for preauthorization or claim of benefits is made, a beneficiary, or sponsor, shall provide additional information relevant to the requested determination, when necessary. The recipient of such information shall hold such records confidential except when:
(A) Disclosure of such information is authorized specifically by the beneficiary;
(B) Disclosure is necessary to permit authorized governmental officials to investigate and prosecute criminal actions; or
(C) Disclosure is authorized or required specifically under the terms of DoD Directive 5400.7 and 5400.11, the Freedom of Information Act, and the Privacy Act (refer to paragraph (m) of § 199.1 of this part).
(ii) For the purposes of determining the applicability of and implementing the provisions of §§ 199.8 and 199.9, or any provision of similar purpose of any other medical benefits coverage or entitlement, OCHAMPUS or CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries, without consent or notice to any beneficiary or sponsor, may release to or obtain from any insurance company or other organization, governmental agency, provider, or person, any information with respect to any beneficiary when such release constitutes a routine use duly published in the
Federal Register
in accordance with the Privacy Act.
(iii) Before a beneficiary's claim of benefits is adjudicated, the beneficiary or the provider(s) must furnish to CHAMPUS that information which is necessary to make the benefit determination. Failure to provide the requested information will result in denial of the claim. A beneficiary, by submitting a CHAMPUS claim(s) (either a participating or nonparticipating claim), is deemed to have given consent to the release of any and all medical records or documentation pertaining to the claims and the episode of care.
(c)
Signature on CHAMPUS Claim Form
—(1)
Beneficiary signature.
CHAMPUS claim forms must be signed by the beneficiary except under the conditions identified in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section. The parent or guardian may sign for any beneficiary under 18 years.
(i)
Certification of identity.
This signature certifies that the patient identification information provided is correct.
(ii)
Certification of medical care provided.
This signature certifies that the specific medical care for which benefits are being claimed actually were rendered to the beneficiary on the dates indicated.
(iii)
Authorization to obtain or release information.
Before requesting additional information necessary to process a claim or releasing medical information, the signature of the beneficiary who is 18 years old or older must be recorded on or obtained on the CHAMPUS claim form or on a separate release form. The signature of the beneficiary, parent, or guardian will be requested when the beneficiary is under 18 years.

# Note:
If the care was rendered to a minor and a custodial parent or legal guardian requests information prior to the minor turning 18 years of age, medical records may still be released pursuant to the signature of the parent or guardian, and claims information may still be released to the parent or guardian in response to the request, even though the beneficiary has turned 18 between the time of the request and the response. However, any follow-up request or subsequent request from the parent or guardian, after the beneficiary turns 18 years of age, will necessitate the authorization of the beneficiary (or the beneficiary's legal guardian as appointed by a cognizant court), before records and information can be released to the parent or guardian.
(iv)
Certification of accuracy and authorization to release double coverage information.
This signature certifies to the accuracy of the double coverage information and authorizes the release of any information related to double coverage. (Refer to § 199.8 of this part).
(v)
Exceptions to beneficiary signature requirement.
(A) Except as required by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, the signature of a spouse, parent, or guardian will be accepted on a claim submitted for a beneficiary who is 18 years old or older.
(B) When the institutional provider obtains the signature of the beneficiary (or the signature of the parent or guardian when the beneficiary is under 18 years) on a CHAMPUS claim form at admission, the following participating claims may be submitted without the beneficiary's signature.

) Claims for laboratory and diagnostic tests and test interpretations from radiologists, pathologists, neurologists, and cardiologists.
(
2
) Claims from anesthesiologists.
(C) Claims filed by providers using CHAMPUS-approved signature-on-file and claims submission procedures.
(2)
Provider's signature.
A participating provider (see paragraph (a)(8) of § 199.6) is required to sign the CHAMPUS claim form.
(i)
Certification.
A participating provider's signature on a CHAMPUS claim form:
(A) Certifies that the specific medical care listed on the claim form was, in fact, rendered to the specific beneficiary for which benefits are being claimed, on the specific date or dates indicated, at the level indicated and by the provider signing the claim unless the claim otherwise indicates another individual provided the care. For example, if the claim is signed by a psychiatrist and the care billed was rendered by a psychologist or licensed social worker, the claim must indicate both the name and profession of the individual who rendered the care.
(B) Certifies that the provider has agreed to participate (providing this agreement has been indicated on the claim form) and that the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost will constitute the full charge or cost for the medical care listed on the specific claim form; and further agrees to accept the amount paid by CHAMPUS or the CHAMPUS payment combined with the cost-shared amount paid by, or on behalf of the beneficiary, as full payment for the covered medical services or supplies.
(
1
) Thus, neither CHAMPUS nor the sponsor is responsible for any additional charges, whether or not the CHAMPUS-determined charge or cost is less than the billed amount.
(
2
) Any provider who signs and submits a CHAMPUS claim form and then violates this agreement by billing the beneficiary or sponsor for any difference between the CHAMPUS-determined charge or cost and the amount billed is acting in bad faith and is subject to penalties including withdrawal of CHAMPUS approval as a CHAMPUS provider by administrative action of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, and possible legal action on the part of CHAMPUS, either directly or as a part of a beneficiary action, to recover monies improperly obtained from CHAMPUS beneficiaries or sponsors (refer to § 199.6 of this part.)
(ii)
Physician or other authorized individual professional provider.
A physician or other authorized individual professional provider is liable for any signature submitted on his or her behalf. Further, a facsimile signature is not acceptable unless such facsimile signature is on file with, and has been authorized specifically by, the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary serving the state where the physician or other authorized individual professional provider practices.
(iii)
Hospital or other authorized institutional provider.
The provider signature on a claim form for institutional services must be that of an authorized representative of the hospital or other authorized institutional provider, whose signature is on file with and approved by the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary.
(d)
Claims filing deadline.
For all services provided on or after January 1, 1993, to be considered for benefits, all claims submitted for benefits must, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, be filed with the appropriate CHAMPUS contractor no later than one year after the services are provided. Unless the requirement is waived, failure to file a claim within this deadline waives all rights to benefits for such services or supplies.
(1)
Claims returned for additional information.
When a claim is submitted initially within the claim filing time limit, but is returned in whole or in part for additional information to be considered for benefits, the returned claim, along with the requested information, must be resubmitted and received by the appropriate CHAMPUS contractor no later than the later of:
(i) One year after the services are provided; or
(ii) 90 days from the date the claim was returned to the provider or beneficiary.
(2)
Exception to claims filing deadline.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may grant exceptions to the claims filing deadline requirements.
(i)
Types of exception.
(A)
Retroactive eligibility.
Retroactive CHAMPUS eligibility determinations.
(B)
Administrative error.
Administrative error (that is, misrepresentation, mistake, or other accountable action) of an officer or employee of OCHAMPUS (including OCHAMPUSEUR) or a CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary, performing functions under CHAMPUS and acting within the scope of that official's authority.
(C)
Mental incompetency.
Mental incompetency of the beneficiary or guardian or sponsor, in the case of a minor child (which includes inability to communicate, even if it is the result of a physical disability).
(D)
Delays by other health insurance.
When not attributable to the beneficiary, delays in adjudication by other health insurance companies when double coverage coordination is required before the CHAMPUS benefit determination.
(E)
Other waiver authority.
The Director, OCHAMPUS may waive the claims filing deadline in other circumstances in which the Director determines that the waiver is necessary in order to ensure adequate access for CHAMPUS beneficiaries to health care services.
(ii)
Request for exception to claims filing deadline.
Beneficiaries who wish to request an exception to the claims filing deadline may submit such a request to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary having jurisdiction over the location in which the service was rendered, or as otherwise designated by the Director, OCHAMPUS.
(A) Such requests for an exception must include a complete explanation of the circumstances of the late filing, together with all available documentation supporting the request, and the specific claim denied for late filing.
(B) Each request for an exception to the claims filing deadline is reviewed individually and considered on its own merits.
(e)
Other claims filing requirements.
Notwithstanding the claims filing deadline described in paragraph (d) of this section, to lessen any potential adverse impact on a CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor that could result from a retroactive denial, the following additional claims filing procedures are recommended or required.
(1)
Continuing care.
Except for claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, whenever medical
services and supplies are being rendered on a continuing basis, an appropriate claim or claims should be submitted every 30 days (monthly) whether submitted directly by the beneficiary or sponsor or by the provider on behalf of the beneficiary. Such claims may be submitted more frequently if the beneficiary or provider so elects. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, also may require more frequent claims submission based on dollars. Examples of care that may be rendered on a continuing basis are outpatient physical therapy, private duty (special) nursing, or inpatient stays. For claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, claims may be submitted only after the beneficiary has been discharged or transferred from the hospital.
(2) [Reserved]
(3) Claims involving the services of marriage and family counselors, pastoral counselors, and supervised mental health counselors. CHAMPUS requires that marriage and family counselors, pastoral counselors, and supervised mental health counselors make a written report to the referring physician concerning the CHAMPUS beneficiary's progress. Therefore, each claim for reimbursement for services of marriage and family counselors, pastoral counselors, and supervised mental health counselors must include certification to the effect that a written communication has been made or will be made to the referring physician at the end of treatment, or more frequently, as required by the referring physician.
(f)
Preauthorization.
When specifically required in other sections of this part, preauthorization requires the following:
(1)
Preauthorization must be granted before benefits can be extended.
In those situations requiring preauthorization, the request for such preauthorization shall be submitted and approved before benefits may be extended, except as provided in § 199.4(a)(11). If a claim for services or supplies is submitted without the required preauthorization, no benefits shall be paid, unless the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, has granted an exception to the requirement for preauthorization.
(i)
Specifically preauthorized services.
An approved preauthorization specifies the exact services or supplies for which authorization is being given. In a preauthorization situation, benefits cannot be extended for services or supplies provided beyond the specific authorization.
(ii)
Time limit on preauthorization.
Approved preauthorizations are valid for specific periods of time, appropriate for the circumstances presented and specified at the time the preauthorization is approved. In general, preauthorizations are valid for 30 days. If the preauthorized service or supplies are not obtained or commenced within the specified time limit, a new preauthorization is required before benefits may be extended. For organ and stem cell transplants, the preauthorization shall remain in effect as long as the beneficiary continues to meet the specific transplant criteria set forth in the TRICARE/CHAMPUS Policy Manual, or until the approved transplant occurs.
(2)
Treatment plan.
Each preauthorization request shall be accompanied by a proposed medical treatment plan (for inpatient stays under the Basic Program) which shall include generally a diagnosis; a detailed summary of complete history and physical; a detailed statement of the problem; the proposed treatment modality, including anticipated length of time the proposed modality will be required; any available test results; consultant's reports; and the prognosis. When the preauthorization request involves transfer from a hospital to another inpatient facility, medical records related to the inpatient stay also must be provided.
(3)
Claims for services and supplies that have been preauthorized.
Whenever a claim is submitted for benefits under CHAMPUS involving preauthorized services and supplies, the date of the approved preauthorization must be indicated on the claim form and a copy of the written preauthorization must be attached to the appropriate CHAMPUS claim.
(4)
Advance payment prohibited.
No CHAMPUS payment shall be made for otherwise authorized services or items
not yet rendered or delivered to the beneficiary.
(g)
Claims review.
It is the responsibility of the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary (or OCHAMPUS, including OCHAMPUSEUR) to review each CHAMPUS claim submitted for benefit consideration to ensure compliance with all applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, or exclusions specified or enumerated in this part. It is also required that before any CHAMPUS benefits may be extended, claims for medical services and supplies will be subject to utilization review and quality assurance standards, norms, and criteria issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee (see paragraph (a)(1)(v) of § 199.14 for review standards for claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system).
(h)
Benefit payments.
CHAMPUS benefit payments are made either directly to the beneficiary or sponsor or to the provider, depending on the manner in which the CHAMPUS claim is submitted.
(1)
Benefit payments made to beneficiary or sponsor.
When the CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor signs and submits a specific claim form directly to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary (or OCHAMPUS, including OCHAMPUSEUR), any CHAMPUS benefit payments due as a result of that specific claim submission will be made in the name of, and mailed to, the beneficiary or sponsor. In such circumstances, the beneficiary or sponsor is responsible to the provider for any amounts billed.
(2)
Benefit payments made to participating provider.
When the authorized provider elects to participate by signing a CHAMPUS claim form, indicating participation in the appropriate space on the claim form, and submitting a specific claim on behalf of the beneficiary to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary, any CHAMPUS benefit payments due as a result of that claim submission will be made in the name of and mailed to the participating provider. Thus, by signing the claim form, the authorized provider agrees to abide by the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost, whether or not lower than the amount billed. Therefore, the beneficiary or sponsor is responsible only for any required deductible amount and any cost-sharing portion of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost as may be required under the terms and conditions set forth in §§ 199.4 and 199.5 of this part.
(3)
CEOB.
When a CHAMPUS claim is adjudicated, a CEOB is sent to the beneficiary or sponsor. A copy of the CEOB also is sent to the provider if the claim was submitted on a participating basis. The CEOB form provides, at a minimum, the following information:
(i) Name and address of beneficiary.
(ii) Name and address of provider.
(iii) Services or supplies covered by claim for which CEOB applies.
(iv) Dates services or supplies provided.
(v) Amount billed; CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost; and amount of CHAMPUS payment.
(vi) To whom payment, if any, was made.
(vii) Reasons for any denial.
(viii) Recourse available to beneficiary for review of claim decision (refer to § 199.10 of this part).

# Note:
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may authorize a CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary to waive a CEOB to protect the privacy of a CHAMPUS beneficiary.
(4)
Benefit under $1.
If the CHAMPUS benefit is determined to be under $1, payment is waived.
(i)
Extension of the Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan to areas outside the United States.
The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA) may, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1076a(h), extend the Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan to areas other than those areas specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for the eligible beneficiaries of members of the Uniformed Services. In extending the program outside the Continental United States, the ASD(HA), or designee, is authorized to establish program elements, methods of administration and payment rates and procedures to providers that are different from those in effect under this section in the Continental United States to the extent the ASD(HA), or designee, determines necessary for the effective and efficient
operation of the plan outside the Continental United States. This includes provisions for preauthorization of care if the needed services are not available in a Uniformed Service overseas dental treatment facility and payment by the Department of certain cost-shares and other portions of a provider's billed charges. Other differences may occur based on limitations in the availability and capabilities of the Uniformed Services overseas dental treatment facility and a particular nation's civilian sector providers in certain areas. Otherwise, rules pertaining to services covered under the plan and quality of care standards for providers shall be comparable to those in effect under this section in the Continental United States and available military guidelines. In addition, all provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1076a shall remain in effect.
(j)
General assignment of benefits not recognized.
CHAMPUS does not recognize any general assignment of CHAMPUS benefits to another person. All CHAMPUS benefits are payable as described in this and other Sections of this part.

§ 199.8
Double coverage.
(a)
Introduction.
(1) In enacting TRICARE legislation, Congress clearly has intended that TRICARE be the secondary payer to all health benefit, insurance and third-party payer plans. 10 U.S.C. 1079(j)(1) specifically provides that a benefit may not be paid under a plan (CHAMPUS) covered by this section in the case of a person enrolled in, or covered by, any other insurance, medical service, or health plan, including any plan offered by a third-party payer (as defined in 10 U.S.C. 1095(h)(1)) to the extent that the benefit is also a benefit under the other plan, except in the case of a plan administered under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396
et seq.
).
(2) The provision in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is made applicable specifically to retired members, dependents, and survivors by 10 U.S.C. 1086(g). The underlying intent, in addition to preventing waste of Federal resources, is to ensure that TRICARE beneficiaries receive maximum benefits while ensuring that the combined payments of TRICARE and other health and insurance plans do not exceed the total charges.
(b)
Double coverage plan.
A double coverage plan is one of the following:
(1)
Insurance plan.
An insurance plan is any plan or program that is designed to provide compensation or coverage for expenses incurred by a beneficiary for medical services and supplies. It includes plans or programs for which the beneficiary pays a premium to an issuing agent as well as those plans or programs to which the beneficiary is entitled as a result of employment or membership in, or association with, an organization or group.
(2)
Medical service or health plan.
A medical service or health plan is any plan or program of an organized health care group, corporation, or other entity for the provision of health care to an individual from plan providers, both professional and institutional. It includes plans or programs for which the beneficiary pays a premium to an issuing agent as well as those plans or programs to which the beneficiary is entitled as a result of employment or membership in, or association with, an organization or group.
(3)
Third-party payer.
A third-party payer means an entity that provides an insurance, medical service, or health plan by contract or agreement, including an automobile liability insurance or no-fault insurance carrier and a workers' compensation program or plan, and any other plan or program (e.g., homeowners insurance, etc.) that is designed to provide compensation or coverage for expenses incurred by a beneficiary for medical services or supplies. For purposes of the definition of “third-party payer,” an insurance, medical service or health plan includes a preferred provider organization, an insurance plan described as Medicare supplemental insurance, and a personal injury protection plan or medical payments benefit plan for personal injuries resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle.
(4)
Exceptions.
Double coverage plans do not include:
(i) Plans administered under title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid);
(ii) Coverage specifically designed to supplement CHAMPUS benefits (a health insurance policy or other health benefit plan that meets the definition and criteria under supplemental insurance plan as set forth in § 199.2(b));
(iii) Entitlement to receive care from Uniformed Services medical care facilities;
(iv) Certain Federal Government programs, as prescribed by the Director, OCHAMPUS, that are designed to provide benefits to a distinct beneficiary population and for which entitlement does not derive from either premium payment of monetary contribution (for example, the Indian Health Service); or
(v) State Victims of Crime Compensation Programs.
(c)
Application of double coverage provisions.
CHAMPUS claims submitted for otherwise covered services or supplies and which involve double coverage shall be adjudicated as follows:
(1)
TRICARE last pay.
For any claim that involves a double coverage plan as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, TRICARE shall be last pay
except
as may be authorized by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. That is, TRICARE benefits may not be extended until all other double coverage plans have adjudicated the claim.
(2)
TRICARE advance payment.
The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, may authorize payment of a claim in advance of adjudication of the claim by a double coverage plan and recover, under § 199.12, the TRICARE costs of health care incurred on behalf of the covered beneficiary under the following conditions:
(i) The claim is submitted for health care services furnished to a covered beneficiary; and,
(ii) The claim is identified as involving services for which a third-party payer, other than a primary medical insurer, may be liable.
(3)
Primary medical insurer.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a “primary medical insurer” is an insurance plan, medical service or health plan, or a third-party payer under this section, the primary or sole purpose of which is to provide or pay for health care services, supplies, or equipment. The term “primary medical insurer” does not include automobile liability insurance, no-fault insurance, workers' compensation program or plan, homeowners insurance, or any other similar third-party payer as may be designated by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, in any policy guidance or instructions issued in implementation of this Part.
(4)
Waiver of benefits.
A CHAMPUS beneficiary may not elect to waive benefits under a double coverage plan and use CHAMPUS. Whenever double coverage exists, the provisions of this Section shall be applied.
(5)
Lack of payment by double coverage plan.
Amounts that have been denied by a double coverage plan simply because a claim was not filed timely or because the beneficiary failed to meet some other requirement of coverage cannot be paid. If a statement from the double coverage plan as to how much that plan would have paid had the claim met the plan's requirements is provided to the CHAMPUS contractor, the claim can be processed as if the double coverage plan actually paid the amount shown on the statement. If no such statement is received, no payment from CHAMPUS is authorized.
(d)
Special considerations
—(1)
CHAMPUS and Medicare
—(i)
General rule.
In any case in which a beneficiary is eligible for both Medicare and CHAMPUS received medical or dental care for which payment may be made under Medicare and CHAMPUS, Medicare is always the primary payer except in the case of retroactive determinations of disability as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section. For dependents of active duty members, payment will be determined in accordance to paragraph (c) of this section. For all other beneficiaries eligible for Medicare, the amount payable under CHAMPUS shall be the amount of actual out-of-pocket costs incurred by the beneficiary for that care over the sum of the amount paid for that care under Medicare and the total of all
amounts paid or payable by third party payers other than Medicare.
(ii)
Payment limit.
The total CHAMPUS amount payable for care under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section may not exceed the total amount that would be paid under CHAMPUS if payment for that care was made solely under CHAMPUS.
(iii)
Application of general rule.
In applying the general rule under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the first determination will be whether payment may be made under Medicare. For this purpose, Medicare exclusions, conditions, and limitations will be based for the determination.
(A) For items or services or portions or segments of items or services for which payment may be made under Medicare, the CHAMPUS payment will be the amount of the beneficiary's actual out of pocket liability, minus the amount payable by Medicare, also minus amount payable by other third party payers, subject to the limit under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
(B) For items or services or segments of items or services for which no payment may be made under Medicare, the CHAMPUS payment will be the same as it would be for a CHAMPUS eligible retiree, dependent, or survivor beneficiary who is not Medicare eligible.
(C) For Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in Medicare Part D, the Part D plan is primary and TRICARE is secondary payer. TRICARE will pay the beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs for Medicare and TRICARE covered medications, including the initial deductible and Medicare Part D cost-sharing amounts up to the initial coverage limit of the Medicare Part D plan. The Medicare Part D plan, although the primary plan, pays nothing during any coverage gap period. When the beneficiary becomes responsible for 100 percent of the drug costs under a Part D coverage gap period, the beneficiary may use the TRICARE pharmacy benefit as the secondary payer. TRICARE will cost share during the coverage gap to the same extent as it does under Section 199.21 for beneficiaries not enrolled in Medicare Part D plan. The beneficiary is responsible for the applicable TRICARE pharmacy cost-sharing amounts (and deductible if using a retail non-network pharmacy). Part D plan sponsors may offer a defined standard benefit, or an actuarially equivalent standard benefit. Part D plan sponsors may also offer alternative prescription drug coverage, which may consist of basic alternative coverage or enhanced alternative coverage. Therefore depending on the Part D plan that a beneficiary chooses, monthly premiums, coinsurances, co-pays, deductibles and benefit design may vary from plan to plan. TRICARE payment of the beneficiary's initial deductible, if any, along with payment of any beneficiary cost share count towards total spending on drugs, and may have the effect of moving the beneficiary more quickly through the initial phase of coverage to the coverage gap. Irrespective of the phase of the benefit in which a beneficiary may be, if a beneficiary is accessing a pharmacy under contract with his or her Part D plan, the provider will bill the Part D plan first, then TRICARE. If the beneficiary chooses to use his or her TRICARE pharmacy benefit during a coverage gap under Part D, the beneficiary may do so, but the beneficiary is responsible for the TRICARE cost-shares.
(iv)
Examples of applications of general rule.
The following examples are illustrative. They are not all-inclusive.
(A) In the case of a Medicare-eligible beneficiary receiving typical physician office visit services, Medicare payment generally will be made. CHAMPUS payment will be determined consistent with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.
(B) In the case of a Medicare-eligible beneficiary residing and receiving medical care overseas, Medicare payment generally may not be made. CHAMPUS payment will be determined consistent with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.
(C) In the case of a Medicare-eligible beneficiary receiving skilled nursing facility services a portion of which is payable by Medicare (such as during the first 100 days) and a portion of which is not payable by Medicare (such as after 100 days), CHAMPUS payment for the first portion will be determined consistent with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A)
of this section and for the second portion consistent with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.
(v)
Application of catastrophic cap.
Only in cases in which CHAMPUS payment is determined consistent with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, actual beneficiary out of pocket liability remaining after CHAMPUS payments will be counted for purposes of the annual catastrophic loss protection, set forth under § 199.4(f)(10). When a family has met the cap, CHAMPUS will pay allowable amounts for remaining covered services through the end of that calendar year.
(vi)
Retroactive determinations of disability.
In circumstances involving determinations of retroactive Medicare Part A entitlement for persons under 65 years of age, Medicare becomes the primary payer effective as of the date of issuance of the retroactive determination by the Social Security Administration. For care and services rendered prior to issuance of the retroactive determination, the CHAMPUS payment will be determined consistent with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section notwithstanding the beneficiary's retroactive entitlement for Medicare Part A during that period.
(vii)
Effect on enrollment in Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plan.
In the case of a beneficiary enrolled in a MA-PD plan who receives items or services for which payment may be made under both the MA-PD plan and CHAMPUS/TRICARE, a claim for the beneficiary's normal out-of-pocket costs under the MA-PD plan may be submitted for CHAMPUS/TRICARE payment. However, consistent with paragraph (c)(4) of this section, out-of-pocket costs do not include costs associated with unauthorized out-of-system care or care otherwise obtained under circumstances that result in a denial or limitation of coverage for care that would have been covered or fully covered had the beneficiary met applicable requirements and procedures. In such cases, the CHAMPUS/TRICARE amount payable is limited to the amount that would have been paid if the beneficiary had received care covered by the Medicare Advantage plan. If the TRICARE-Medicare beneficiary enrolls in a MA-PD drug plan, it generally will be governed by Medicare Part C, although plans that offer a prescription drug benefit must comply with Medicare Part D rules. The beneficiary has to pay the plan's monthly premiums and obtain all medical care and prescription drugs through the Medicare Advantage plan before seeking CHAMPUS/TRICARE payment. CHAMPUS/TRICARE payment for such beneficiaries may not exceed that which would be payable for a beneficiary under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this section.
(viii)
Effect of other double coverage plans, including medigap plans.
CHAMPUS is second payer to other third-party payers of health insurance, including Medicare supplemental plans.
(ix)
Effect of employer-provided insurance.
In the case of individuals with health insurance due to their current employment status, the employer insurance plan shall be first payer, Medicare shall be the second payer, and CHAMPUS shall be the tertiary payer.
(2)
CHAMPUS and Medicaid.
Medicaid is not a double coverage plan. In any double coverage situation involving Medicaid, CHAMPUS is always the primary payer.
(3)
TRICARE and Workers' Compensation.
TRICARE benefits are not payable for a work-related illness or injury that is covered under a workers' compensation program. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, however, the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, may authorize payment of a claim involving a work-related illness or injury covered under a workers' compensation program in advance of adjudication and payment of the workers' compensation claim and then recover, under § 199.12, the TRICARE costs of health care incurred on behalf of the covered beneficiary.
(4)
Extended Care Health Option (ECHO).
For those services or supplies that require use of public facilities, an ECHO eligible beneficiary (or sponsor or guardian acting on behalf of the beneficiary) does not have the option of waiving the full use of public facilities which are determined by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or designee to be available and adequate to meet a disability related need for
which an ECHO benefit was requested. Benefits eligible for payment under a state plan for medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) are never considered to be available in the adjudication of ECHO benefits.
(5)
Primary payer.
The requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of this section notwithstanding, TRICARE is primary payer for services and items that are provided in accordance with the Individualized Family Service Plan as required by Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and that are medically or psychologically necessary and otherwise allowable under the TRICARE Basic Program or the Extended Care Health Option.
(6)
Prohibition against financial and other incentives not to enroll in a group health plan
—(i)
General rule.
Under 10 U.S.C. 1097c, an employer or other entity is prohibited from offering TRICARE beneficiaries financial or other benefits as incentives not to enroll in, or to terminate enrollment in, a group health plan that is or would be primary to TRICARE. This prohibition applies in the same manner as section 1862(b)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act applies to incentives for a Medicare-eligible employee not to enroll in a group health plan that is or would be primary to Medicare.
(ii)
Application of general rule.
The prohibition in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section precludes offering to TRICARE beneficiaries an alternative to the employer primary plan unless:
(A) The beneficiary has primary coverage other than TRICARE; or
(B) The benefit is offered under a cafeteria plan under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code and is offered to all similarly situated employees, including non-TRICARE eligible employees; or
(C) The benefit is offered under a cafeteria plan under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code and, although offered only to TRICARE-eligible employees, the employer does not provide any payment for the benefit nor receive any direct or indirect consideration or compensation for offering the benefit; the employer's only involvement is providing the administrative support for the benefits under the cafeteria plan, and the employee's participation in the plan is completely voluntary.
(iii)
Documentation.
In the case of a benefit excluded by paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) of this section from the prohibition in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, the exclusion is dependent on the employer maintaining in the employer's files a certification signed by the employer that the conditions described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) of this section are met, and, upon request of the Department of Defense, providing a copy of that certification to the Department of Defense.
(iv)
Remedies and penalties.
(A) Remedies for violation of this paragraph (d)(6) include but are not limited to remedies under the Federal Claims Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3701
et seq.
(B) Penalties for violation of this paragraph (d)(6) include a civil monetary penalty of up to $5,000 for each violation. The provisions of section 1128A of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a, (other than subsections (a) and (b)) apply to the civil monetary penalty in the same manner as the provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1128A.
(v)
Definitions.
For the purposes of this paragraph (d)(6):
(A) The term “employer” includes any State or unit of local government and any employer that employs at least 20 employees.
(B) The term “group health plan” means a group health plan as that term is defined in section 5000(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 without regard to section 5000(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
(C) The term “similarly situated” means sharing common attributes, such as part-time employees, or other bona fide employment-based classifications consistent with the employer's usual business practice. (Internal Revenue Service regulations at 26 CFR 54.9802-1(d) may be used as a reference for this purpose). However, in no event shall eligibility for or entitlement to TRICARE (or ineligibility or non-entitlement to TRICARE) be considered a bona fide employment-based classification.
(D) The term “TRICARE-eligible employee” means a covered beneficiary
under section 1086 of title 10, United States Code, Chapter 55, entitled to health care benefits under the TRICARE program.
(vi)
Procedures.
The Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services are authorized to enter into agreements to further carry out this section.
(e)

§ 199.9
Administrative remedies for fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest.
(a)
General.
(1) This section sets forth provisions for invoking administrative remedies under CHAMPUS in situations involving fraud, abuse, or conflict of interest. The remedies impact institutional providers, professional providers, and beneficiaries (including parents, guardians, or other representatives of beneficiaries), and cover situations involving criminal fraud, civil fraud, administrative determinations of conflicts of interest or dual compensation, and administrative determinations of fraud or abuse. The administrative actions, remedies, and procedures may differ based upon whether the initial findings were made by a court of law, another agency, or the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee).
(2) This section also sets forth provisions for invoking administrative remedies in situations requiring administrative action to enforce provisions of law, regulation, and policy in the administration of CHAMPUS and to ensure quality of care for CHAMPUS beneficiaries. Examples of such situations may include a case in which it is discovered that a provider fails to meet requirements under this part to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider; a case in which the provider ceases to be qualified as a CHAMPUS provider because of suspension or revocation of the provider's license by a local licensing authority; or a case in which a provider meets the minimum requirements under this part but, nonetheless, it is determined that it is in the best interest of the CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries that the provider should not be an authorized CHAMPUS provider.
(3) The administrative remedies set forth in this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or sanctions authorized by law or regulation. For example, administrative action under this section may be taken in a particular case even if the same case will be or has been processed under the administrative procedures established by the Department of Defense to implement the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act.
(4) Providers seeking payment from the Federal Government through programs such as CHAMPUS have a duty to familiarize themselves with, and comply with, the program requirements.
(5) CHAMPUS contractors and peer review organizations have a responsibility to apply provisions of this regulation in the discharge of their duties, and to report all known situations involving fraud, abuse, or conflict of interest. Failure to report known situations involving fraud, abuse, or conflict of interest will result in the withholding of administrative payments or other contractual remedies as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(b)
Abuse.
The term “abuse” generally describes incidents and practices which may directly or indirectly cause financial loss to the Government under CHAMPUS or to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. For the definition of abuse, see § 199.2 of this part. The type of abuse to which CHAMPUS is most vulnerable is the CHAMPUS claim involving the overutilization of medical and health care services. To avoid abuse situations, providers have certain obligations to provide services and supplies under CHAMPUS which are: Furnished at the appropriate level and only when and to the extent medically necessary as determined under the provisions of
this part; of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of health care; and, supported by adequate medical documentation as may reasonably be required under this part by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, to evidence the medical necessity and quality of services furnished, as well as the appropriateness of the level of care. A provider's failure to comply with these obligations can result in sanctions being imposed by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, under this section. Even when administrative remedies are not initiated under this section, abuse situations under CHAMPUS are a sufficient basis for denying all or any part of CHAMPUS cost-sharing of individual claims. The types of abuse or possible abuse situations under CHAMPUS include, but are not limited, to the following:
(1) A pattern of waiver of beneficiary (patient) cost-share or deductible.

# Note:
In a case of a legitimate bad debt write-off of patient cost-share or deductible, the provider's record should include documentation as to what efforts were made to collect the debt, when the debt was written off, why the debt was written off, and the amount of the debt written off.
(2) Improper billing practices. Examples include, charging CHAMPUS beneficiaries rates for services and supplies that are in excess of those charges routinely charged by the provider to the general public, commercial health insurance carriers, or other federal health benefit entitlement programs for the same or similar services. (This includes dual fee schedules—one for CHAMPUS beneficiaries and one for other patients or third-party payers. This also includes billing other third-party payers the same as CHAMPUS is billed but accepting less than the billed amount as reimbursement. However, a formal discount arrangement such as through a preferred provider organization, may not necessarily constitute an improper billing practice.)
(3) A pattern of claims for services which are not medically necessary or, if medically necessary, not to the extent rendered. For example, a battery of diagnostic tests are given when, based on the diagnosis, fewer tests were needed.
(4) Care of inferior quality. For example, consistently furnishing medical or mental health services that do not meet accepted standards of care.
(5) Failure to maintain adequate medical or financial records.
(6) Refusal to furnish or allow the Government (for example, OCHAMPUS) or Government contractors access to records related to CHAMPUS claims.
(7) Billing substantially in excess of customary or reasonable charges unless it is determined by OCHAMPUS that the excess charges are justified by unusual circumstances or medical complications requiring additional time, effort, or expense in localities when it is accepted medical practice to make an extra charge in such cases.
(8) Unauthorized use of the term “Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS)” in private business. While the use of the term “CHAMPUS” is not prohibited by federal statute, misrepresentation or deception by use of the term “CHAMPUS” to imply an official connection with the Government or to defraud CHAMPUS beneficiaries may be a violation of federal statute. Regardless of whether the actual use of the term “CHAMPUS” may be actionable under federal statute, the unauthorized or deceptive use of the term “CHAMPUS” in private business will be considered abuse for purposes of this Section.
(c)
Fraud.
For the definition of fraud, see § 199.2 of this part. Examples of situations which, for the purpose of this part, are presumed to be fraud include, but are not limited to:
(1) Submitting CHAMPUS claims (including billings by providers when the claim is submitted by the beneficiary) for services, supplies, or equipment not furnished to, or used by, CHAMPUS beneficiaries. For example, billing or claiming services when the provider was on call (other than an authorized standby charge) and did not provide any specific medical care to the beneficiary; providing services to an ineligible person and billing or submitting a claim for the services in the name of an eligible CHAMPUS beneficiary; billing or submitting a CHAMPUS claim for
an office visit for a missed appointment; or billing or submitting a CHAMPUS claim for individual psychotherapy when a medical visit was the only service provided.
(2) Billing or submitting a CHAMPUS claim for costs for noncovered or nonchargeable services, supplies, or equipment disguised as covered items. Some examples are: (i) Billings or CHAMPUS claims for services which would be covered except for the frequency or duration of the services, such as billing or submitting a claim for two one-hour psychotherapy sessions furnished on separate days when the actual service furnished was a two-hour therapy session on a single day, (ii) spreading the billing or claims for services over a time period that reduces the apparent frequency to a level that may be cost-shared by CHAMPUS, (iii) charging to CHAMPUS, directly or indirectly, costs not incurred or not reasonably allowable to the services billed or claimed under CHAMPUS, for example, costs attributable to nonprogram activities, other enterprises, or the personal expenses of principals, or (iv) billing or submitting claim on a fee-for-service basis when in fact a personal service to a specific patient was not performed and the service rendered is part of the overall management of, for example, the laboratory or x-ray department.
(3) Breach of a provider participation agreement which results in the beneficiary (including parent, guardian, or other representative) being billed for amounts which exceed the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost.
(4) Billings or CHAMPUS claims for supplies or equipment which are clearly unsuitable for the patient's needs or are so lacking in quality or sufficiency for the purpose as to be virtually worthless.
(5) Billings or CHAMPUS claims which involve flagrant and persistent overutilization of services without proper regard for results, the patient's ailments, condition, medical needs, or the physician's orders.
(6) Misrepresentations of dates, frequency, duration, or description of services rendered, or of the identity of the recipient of the services or the individual who rendered the services.
(7) Submitting falsified or altered CHAMPUS claims or medical or mental health patient records which misrepresent the type, frequency, or duration of services or supplies or misrepresent the name(s) of the individual(s) who provided the services or supplies.
(8) Duplicate billings or CHAMPUS claims. This includes billing or submitting CHAMPUS claims more than once for the same services, billing or submitting claims both to CHAMPUS and the beneficiary for the same services, or billing or submitting claims both to CHAMPUS and other third-parties (such as other health insurance or government agencies) for the same services, without making full disclosure of material facts or immediate, voluntary repayment or notification to CHAMPUS upon receipt of payments which combined exceed the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge of the services involved.
(9) Misrepresentation by a provider of his or her credentials or concealing information or business practices which bear on the provider's qualifications for authorized CHAMPUS provider status. For example, a provider representing that he or she has a qualifying doctorate in clinical psychology when the degree is not from a regionally accredited university.
(10) Reciprocal billing. Billing or claiming services which were furnished by another provider or furnished by the billing provider in a capacity other than as billed or claimed. For example, practices such as the following: (i) One provider performing services for another provider and the latter bills as though he had actually performed the services (e.g., a weekend fill-in); (ii) providing service as an institutional employee and billing as a professional provider for the services; (iii) billing for professional services when the services were provided by another individual who was an institutional employee; (iv) billing for professional services at a higher provider profile than would be paid for the person actually furnishing the services, (for example, bills reflecting that an M.D. or Ph.D. performed the services when services were actually furnished by a licensed social worker, psychiatric
nurse, or marriage and family counselor); or (v) an authorized provider billing for services which were actually furnished by an unauthorized or sanctioned provider.
(11) Submitting CHAMPUS claims at a rate higher than a rate established between CHAMPUS and the provider, if such a rate has been established. For example, billing or claiming a rate in excess of the provider's most favored rate limitation specified in a residential treatment center agreement.
(12) Arrangements by providers with employees, independent contractors, suppliers, or others which appear to be designed primarily to overcharge the CHAMPUS through various means (such as commissions, fee-splitting, and kickbacks) used to divert or conceal improper or unnecessary costs or profits.
(13) Agreements or arrangements between the supplier and recipient (recipient could be either a provider or beneficiary, including the parent, guardian, or other representative of the beneficiary) that result in billings or claims which include unnecessary costs or charges to CHAMPUS.
(d)
Conflict of Interest.
(1) Conflict of interest includes any situation where an active duty member of the Uniformed Services (including a reserve member while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training) or civilian employee of the United States Government, through an official federal position has the apparent or actual opportunity to exert, directly or indirectly, any influence on the referral of CHAMPUS beneficiaries to himself/herself or others with some potential for personal gain or the appearance of impropriety. Although individuals under contract to the Uniformed Services are not considered “employees,” such individuals are subject to conflict of interest provisions by express terms of their contracts and, for purposes of this part, may be considered to be involved in conflict of interest situations as a result of their contract positions. In any situation involving potential conflict of interest of a Uniformed Service employee, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may refer the case to the Uniformed Service concerned for appropriate review and action. If such a referral is made, a report of the results of findings and action taken shall be made to the Director, OCHAMPUS, by the Uniformed Service having jurisdiction within 90 days of receiving the referral.
(2) CHAMPUS cost-sharing shall be denied on any claim where a conflict of interest situation is found to exist. This denial of cost-sharing applies whether the claim is submitted by the individual who provided the care, the institutional provider in which the care was furnished, or the beneficiary.
(e)
Dual Compensation.
(1) Federal law (5 U.S.C. 5536) prohibits active duty members of the Uniformed Services or employees (including part-time or intermittent) appointed in the civil service of the United States Government from receiving additional compensation from the Government above their normal pay and allowances. This prohibition applies to CHAMPUS payments for care furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by active duty members of the Uniformed Services or civilian employees of the Government.
(2) CHAMPUS cost-sharing of a claim shall be denied where the services or supplies were provided by an active duty member of the Uniformed Services or a civilian employee of the Government. This denial of CHAMPUS payment applies whether the claim for reimbursement is filed by the individual who provided the care, the institutional provider in which the care was furnished, or by the beneficiary.

# Note:
Physicians of the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) may be assigned to areas where there is a shortage of medical providers. Although these physicians would be prohibited from accepting CHAMPUS payments as individuals if they are employees of the United States Government, the private organizations to which they may be assigned may be eligible for payment, as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(3) The prohibition against dual compensation does not apply to individuals under contract to the Uniformed Services or the Government.
(f)
Administrative Remedies.
Administrative remedies available under CHAMPUS in this section are set forth below.
(1)
Provider exclusion or suspension.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall have the authority to exclude or suspend an otherwise authorized CHAMPUS provider from the program based on any criminal conviction or civil judgment involving fraud by the provider; fraud or abuse under CHAMPUS by the provider; exclusion or suspension of the provider by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or local licensing authority; participation in a conflict of interest situation by the provider; or, when it is in the best interests of the program or CHAMPUS beneficiaries to exclude or suspend a provider under CHAMPUS. In all cases, the exclusion or suspension of a provider shall be effective 15 calendar days from the date on the written initial determination issued under paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(i)
Criminal conviction or civil judgment involving fraud by a provider
—(A)
Criminal conviction involving CHAMPUS fraud.
A provider convicted by a Federal, state, foreign, or other court of competent jurisdiction of a crime involving CHAMPUS fraud, whether the crime is a felony or misdemeanor, shall be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS for a period of time as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. The CHAMPUS exclusion or suspension applies whether or not the provider, as a result of the conviction, receives probation or the sentence is suspended or deferred, and whether or not the conviction or sentence is under appeal.

# Note:
Under the above paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) of this section, an entity may be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS whenever the entity is found to have a person, convicted of a crime involving CHAMPUS fraud, who has a direct or indirect ownership or control interest (see § 199.2) of 5 percent or more in the entity, or is an officer, director, agent or managing employee of the entity. The entity will have an opportunity to provide evidence to show that the ownership or control relationship has ceased. While an entity will not be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS for employing a provider who has been sanctioned under this Section, the entity will be denied CHAMPUS payment for any services furnished by the sanctioned employee. As an authorized CHAMPUS provider, the entity is responsible for ensuring that all CHAMPUS claims involve services furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by employees who meet all requirements under CHAMPUS for provider status.
(B)
Criminal conviction involving fraud of other Federal programs.
Any provider convicted by a Federal, state, or other court of competent jurisdiction of a crime involving another Federal health care or benefit program (such as plans administered under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act, Federal Workmen's Compensation, and the Federal Employees Program (FEP) for employee health insurance), whether the crime is a felony or misdemeanor, shall be excluded from CHAMPUS for a period of time as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. The CHAMPUS exclusion or suspension applies whether or not the provider, as a result of the conviction, receives probation or the sentence is suspended or deferred, and whether or not the conviction or sentence is under appeal.
(C)
Criminal conviction involving fraud of non-Federal programs.
Any provider convicted by a Federal, state, foreign, or other court of competent jurisdiction of a crime involving any non-Federal health benefit program or private insurance involving health benefits may be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS for a period of time as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(D)
Civil fraud involving CHAMPUS.
If a judgment involving civil fraud has been entered (whether or not it is appealed) against a provider in a civil action involving CHAMPUS benefits (whether or not other Federal programs are involved), the provider shall be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS for a period determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(E)
Civil fraud involving other programs.
If a judgment involving civil fraud has been entered against a provider (whether or not it has been appealed) in a civil action involving other public or private health care programs or health insurance, the provider may be excluded or suspended for a period of time determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(ii)
Administrative determination of fraud or abuse under CHAMPUS.
If the
Director of the Defense Health Agency determines a provider committed fraud or abuse as defined in this part, the provider shall be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS/TRICARE for a period of time determined by the Director. A final determination of an imposition of a civil money penalty (CMP) under 32 CFR part 200 shall constitute an administrative determination of fraud and abuse.
(iii)
Administrative determination that the provider has been excluded or suspended by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or local licensing authority.
Any provider who is excluded or suspended by any other Federal health care program (for example, Medicare), shall be excluded or suspended under CHAMPUS. A provider who has his/her credentials revoked through a Veterans Administration or Military Department credentials review process and who is excluded, suspended, terminated, retired, or separated, shall also be excluded or suspended under CHAMPUS. The period of time of exclusion or suspension shall be determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.
(iv)
Administrative determination that the provider has participated in a conflict of interest situation.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may exclude or suspend any provider who has knowingly been involved in a conflict of interest situation under CHAMPUS. The period of time of exclusion or suspension shall be determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. For purposes of this administrative determination, it will be presumed that a CHAMPUS provider knowingly participated in a conflict of interest situation if the provider employs, in the treatment of a CHAMPUS beneficiary (resulting in a CHAMPUS claim), any medical personnel who are active duty members of the Uniformed Services or civilian employees of the Government. The burden of proof to rebut this presumption rests with the CHAMPUS provider. Two exceptions will be recognized to the presumption that a conflict of interest exists. First, indirect CHAMPUS payments may be made to private organizations to which physicians of the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) are assigned. Second, any off-duty Government medical personnel employed in an emergency room of an acute care hospital will be presumed not to have had the opportunity to exert, directly or indirectly, any influence on the referral of CHAMPUS beneficiaries; therefore, CHAMPUS payments may be made to the employing hospital
provided
the medical care was not furnished directly by the off-duty Government medical personnel in violation of dual compensation provisions.
(v)
Administrative determination that it is in the best interests of the CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries to exclude or suspend a provider
—(A)
Unethical or improper practices or unprofessional conduct.
(
1
) In most instances, unethical or improper practices or unprofessional conduct by a provider will be program abuse and subject the provider to exclusion or suspension for abuse. However, in some cases such practices and conduct may provide an independent basis for exclusion or suspension of the provider by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(
2
) Such exclusions or suspensions may be based on findings or recommendations of state licensure boards, boards of quality assurance, other regulatory agencies, state medical societies, peer review organizations, or other professional associations.
(B)
In any other case in which the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee), determines that exclusion or suspension of a provider is in the best interests of CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may exclude or suspend any provider if it is determined that the authorization of that particular provider under CHAMPUS poses an unreasonable potential for fraud, abuse, or professional misconduct. Any documented misconduct by the provider reflecting on the business or professional competence or integrity of the provider may be considered. Situations in which the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may take administrative action under this Section to protect CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries include, but are not limited to, a case
in which it is determined that a provider poses an unreasonable potential cost to the Government to monitor the provider for fraud or abuse and to avoid the issuance of erroneous payments; or that the provider poses an unreasonable potential harm to the financial or health status of CHAMPUS beneficiaries; or that the provider poses any other unreasonable threat to the interests of CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries. One example of such circumstances involves a provider who, for his/her entire practice or for most of his/her practice, provides or bills for treatment that is not a CHAMPUS benefit, resulting in CHAMPUS frequently and repeatedly denying claims as non-covered services. This may occur when a professional provider furnishes sex therapy (a therapy which may be recognized by the provider's licensing authority but which is excluded from CHAMPUS coverage) and repeatedly submits CHAMPUS claims for the services.
(2)
Provider termination.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall terminate the provider status of any provider determined not to meet the qualifications established by this part to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider.
(i)
Effective date of termination.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the termination shall be retroactive to the date on which the provider did not meet the requirements of this part.
(A) The retroactive effective date of termination shall not be limited due to the passage of time, erroneous payment of claims, or any other events which may be cited as a basis for CHAMPUS recognition of the provider notwithstanding the fact that the provider does not meet program qualifications. Unless specific provision is made in this part to “grandfather” or authorize a provider who does not otherwise meet the qualifications established by this part, all unqualified providers shall be terminated.
(B) Any claims cost-shared or paid under CHAMPUS for services or supplies furnished by the provider on or after the effective date of termination, even when the effective date is retroactive, shall be deemed an erroneous payment unless specific exception is provided in this part. All erroneous payments are subject to collection under § 199.11 of this part.
(C) If an institution is terminated as an authorized CHAMPUS provider, the institution shall immediately give written notice of the termination to any CHAMPUS beneficiary (or their parent, guardian, or other representative) admitted to, or receiving care at, the institution on or after the effective date of the termination. In addition, when an institution is terminated with an effective date of termination after the date of the initial determination terminating the provider, any beneficiary admitted to the institution prior to the effective date of termination (or their parent, guardian, or other representative) shall be notified by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, by certified mail of the termination, and that CHAMPUS cost-sharing of the beneficiary's care in the institution will cease as of the effective date of the termination. However, any beneficiary admitted to the institution prior to any grace period extended to the institution under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section shall be advised that, if the beneficiary's care otherwise qualifies for CHAMPUS coverage, CHAMPUS cost-sharing of the care in the institution will continue in order to provide a reasonable period of transition of care; however the transitional period of CHAMPUS cost-sharing shall not exceed the last day of the month following the month in which the institution's status as a CHAMPUS provider is terminated. (This authorized CHAMPUS cost-sharing of the inpatient care received during the transition period is an exception to the general rule that CHAMPUS payment for care furnished after the effective date of termination of the provider's status shall be deemed to be an erroneous payment.) If a major violation under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section is involved, in order to ensure immediate action is taken to transfer beneficiaries to an approved provider, CHAMPUS cost-sharing shall not be authorized after the effective date of termination of the provider's status.
(ii)
Institutions not in compliance with CHAMPUS standards.
If it is determined that an institution is not in
compliance with one or more of the standards applicable to its specific category of institution under this part, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall take immediate steps to bring about compliance or terminate the status of the provider as an authorized CHAMPUS provider.
(A)
Minor violations.
An institution determined to be in violation of one or more of the standards shall be advised by certified mail of the nature of the discrepancy or discrepancies and will be given a grace period of 30 days to effect appropriate corrections. The grace period may be extended at the discretion of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, but in no event shall the extension exceed 90 days.
(
1
) CHAMPUS will not cost-share a claim for any beneficiary admitted during the grace period.
(
2
) Any beneficiary admitted to the institution prior to the grace period (or the beneficiary's parent, guardian, or other representative) will be notified by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, in writing, of the minor violations and the grace period granted the institution to correct the violations. The beneficiary will also be advised that, if the beneficiary's care otherwise meets all requirements for CHAMPUS coverage, CHAMPUS cost-sharing will continue during the grace period.
(
3
) If the institution submits written notice before the end of the grace period that corrective action has been taken
and
if the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, determines that the corrective action has eliminated the minor violations, the provider will be advised that the institution is restored to full status as an authorized CHAMPUS provider as of 12:01 a.m. on the day written notice of correction was received by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, or the day on which acceptable corrective action was completed in the judgment of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. Any beneficiary admitted to the institution prior to the grace period will be notified by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, of the corrective action and that the provider continues to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. CHAMPUS cost-sharing for any beneficiary admitted to the institution during the grace period shall be allowed only for care received after 12:01 a.m. on the day written notice of correction was received by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, or the day on which acceptable corrective action was completed in the judgment of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(
4
) If the institution has failed to give notification in writing before the end of the grace period that corrective action has been completed
or,
in the judgment of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, the institution has not completed acceptable corrective action during the grace period, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may initiate action to terminate the provider as an authorized CHAMPUS provider.
(B)
Major violations.
If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, determines that an institution is in violation of standards detrimental to life, safety, or health, or substantially in violation of approved treatment programs, immediate action shall be taken to terminate the institution as an authorized CHAMPUS provider. The institution shall be notified by telegram, certified mail, or express mail of the termination under this subparagraph, effective on receipt of the notice. The notice shall include a brief statement of the nature of violations resulting in the termination and advise the institution that an initial determination formalizing the administrative action of termination will be issued pursuant to paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section within 15 days.
(3)
Beneficiary sanctions.
(i) With entitlement to CHAMPUS benefits based on public law, an eligible beneficiary will not be suspended or excluded from CHAMPUS. However, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may take action deemed appropriate and reasonable to protect the Government from those beneficiaries (including sponsors, parents, guardians, or representatives of beneficiaries) who have submitted false claims.
(ii) Pursuant to § 199.11 of this part, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may recover erroneous payments on claims involving fraud or false or misleading statements. Remedies for
recovery of the erroneous payments include the use of offset against future CHAMPUS payments.
(iii) Under policies adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, individuals who, based on reliable information, have previously submitted fraudulent or false CHAMPUS claims, may be required to comply with any procedures (e.g., partial or total pre-payment audit or review, restriction to a designated primary care provider, etc.) which the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, deems appropriate to ensure that their future medical care and CHAMPUS claims (including the medical care and CHAMPUS claims submitted by or for members of their family) are valid.
(g)
Period of exclusion, suspension, or termination
—(1)
Exclusions or suspensions.
Except as otherwise required by paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall determine the period of exclusion or suspension for a provider using the factors set forth in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section.
(i)
Exclusion or suspension of a provider based on the provider's exclusion or suspension by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or a local licensing authority.
If the administrative action under CHAMPUS is based
solely
on the provider's exclusion or suspension by another agency, state, or local licensing authority, the period of exclusion or suspension under CHAMPUS shall be for the same length of time of exclusion or suspension imposed by the other agency, state, or local licensing authority. The provider may request reinstatement as an authorized CHAMPUS provider if reinstatement is achieved under the other program prior to the end of the period of exclusion or suspension. If the administrative action under CHAMPUS is not based
solely
on the provider's exclusion or suspension by another agency, state, or local licensing authority, the minimum period of exclusion or suspension shall be for the same period of exclusion or suspension imposed by the other agency, state, or local licensing authority.
(ii)
Factors to be considered in determining the period of exclusion or suspension of providers under CHAMPUS.
In determining the period of exclusion or suspension of a provider, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may consider any or all of the following:
(A) When the case concerns all or any part of the same issues which have been the subject of criminal conviction or civil judgment involving fraud by a provider:
(
1
) The period(s) of sentence, probation, and other sanction imposed by court order against the provider may be presumed reasonable and adopted as the administrative period of exclusion or suspension under CHAMPUS, unless aggravating or mitigating factors exist.
(
2
) If any aggravating factors exist, then cause exists for the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, to consider the factors set forth in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, in imposing a period of administrative exclusion or suspension in excess of the period(s) of sentence, probation, and/or other sanctions imposed by court order. Examples of aggravating factors include, but are not limited to:
(
i
) An administrative determination by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, that the basis for administrative exclusion or suspension includes an act(s) of fraud or abuse under CHAMPUS in addition to, or unrelated to, an act(s) of fraud included in the court conviction or civil judgment.
(
ii
) The fraudulent act(s) involved in the criminal conviction or civil judgment, or similar acts, were committed over a significant period of time; that is, one year or more.
(
iii
) The act(s) of fraud or abuse had an adverse physical, mental, or financial impact on one or more CHAMPUS beneficiaries.
(
iv
) The loss or potential loss to CHAMPUS is over $5,000. The entire amount of loss or potential loss to CHAMPUS due to acts of fraud and abuse will be considered, in addition to the amount of loss involved in the court conviction or civil judgment, regardless of whether full or partial restitution has been made to CHAMPUS.
(
v
) The provider has a prior court record, criminal or civil, or administrative record or finding of fraud or abuse.
(
3
) If any mitigating factors exist, then cause may exist for the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, to reduce a period of administrative exclusion or suspension from any period(s) imposed by court conviction or civil judgment. Only the existence of either of the following two factors may be considered in mitigation:
(
i
) The criminal conviction or civil judgment only involved three or fewer misdemeanor offenses, and the total of the estimated losses incurred (including any loss from act(s) not involved in the conviction or judgment) is less than $1,000, regardless of whether full or partial restitution has been made.
(
ii
) The criminal or civil court proceedings establish that the provider had a mental, emotional or physical condition, prior to or contemporaneous with the commission of the act(s), that reduced the provider's criminal or civil culpability.
(B) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may consider the following factors in determining a reasonable period of exclusion or suspension of a provider under CHAMPUS:
(
1
) The nature of the claims and the circumstances under which they were presented;
(
2
) The degree of culpability;
(
3
) History of prior offenses (including whether claims were submitted while the provider was either excluded or suspended pursuant to prior administrative action);
(
4
) Number of claims involved;
(
5
) Dollar amount of claims involved;
(
6
) Whether, if a crime was involved, it was a felony or misdemeanor;
(
7
) If patients were injured financially, mentally, or physically; the number of patients; and the seriousness of the injury(ies);
(
8
) The previous record of the provider under CHAMPUS;
(
9
) Whether restitution has been made or arrangements for repayment accepted by the Government;
(
10
) Whether the provider has resolved the conflict of interest situations or implemented procedures acceptable to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, which will prevent conflict of interest in the future; and,
(
11
) Such other factors as may be deemed appropriate.
(2)
Terminations.
When a provider's status as an authorized CHAMPUS provider is ended, other than through exclusion or suspension, the termination is based on a finding that the provider does not meet the qualifications to be an authorized provider, as set forth in this part. Therefore, the period of termination in all cases will be indefinite and will end only after the provider has successfully met the established qualifications for authorized provider status under CHAMPUS and has been reinstated under CHAMPUS. Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the following guidelines control the termination of authorized CHAMPUS provider status for a provider whose license to practice (or, in the case of an institutional provider, to operate) has been temporarily or permanently suspended or revoked by the jurisdiction issuing the license.
(i) Termination of the provider under CHAMPUS shall continue even if the provider obtains a license to practice in a second jurisdiction during the period of suspension or revocation of the provider's license by the original licensing jurisdiction. A provider who has licenses to practice in two or more jurisdictions and has one or more license(s) suspended or revoked will also be terminated as a CHAMPUS provider.
(A) Professional providers shall remain terminated from the CHAMPUS until the jurisdiction(s) suspending or revoking the provider's license(s) to practice restores it or removes the impediment to restoration.
(B) Institutional providers shall remain terminated under CHAMPUS until their license is restored. In the event the facility is sold, transferred, or reorganized as a new legal entity, and a license issued under a new name or to a different legal entity, the new entity must submit an application to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider.
(ii) If the CHAMPUS provider status is terminated due to the loss of the provider's license, the effective date shall be retroactive to the date the provider lost the license; however, in the case of a professional provider who has licenses in two or more jurisdictions
and submitted claims from a jurisdiction from which he/she had a valid license, the effective date of the termination will be 15 calendar days from the date of the written initial determination of termination for purposes of claims from the jurisdiction in which the provider still has a valid license.
(h)
Procedures for initiating and implementing the administrative remedies
—(1)
Temporary suspension of claims processing.
(i) In general, temporary suspension of claims processing may be invoked to protect the interests of the Government for a period reasonably necessary to complete investigation or appropriate criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings. The temporary suspension only delays the ultimate payment of otherwise appropriate claims. When claims processing involving a participating provider is temporarily suspended, the participation agreement remains in full force and the provider cannot repudiate the agreement because of the delay in the final disposition of the claim(s). Once it has been determined appropriate to end the temporary suspension of claims processing, CHAMPUS claims which were the subject of the suspension and which are otherwise determined to be in compliance with the requirements of law and regulation, will be processed to completion and payment
unless
such action is deemed inappropriate as a result of criminal, civil, or administrative remedies ultimately invoked in the case.
(ii) When adequate evidence exists to determine that a provider or beneficiary is submitting fraudulent or false claims or claims involving practices that may be fraud or abuse as defined by this part, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may suspend CHAMPUS claims processing (in whole or in part) for claims submitted by the beneficiary or any CHAMPUS claims involving care furnished by the provider. The temporary suspension of claims processing for care furnished by a provider may be invoked against all such claims, whether or not the claims are submitted by the beneficiary or by the provider as a participating CHAMPUS provider. In cases involving a provider, notice of the suspension of claims processing may also be given to the beneficiary community either directly or indirectly through notice to appropriate military facilities, health benefit advisors, and the information or news media.
(A) Adequate evidence is any information sufficient to support the reasonable belief that a particular act or omission has occurred.
(B) Indictment or any other initiation of criminal charges, filing of a complaint for civil fraud, issuance of an administrative complaint under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, or issuance of an initial determination under this part for submitting fraudulent or false claims or claims involving practices that may be fraud or abuse as defined by this part, shall constitute adequate evidence for invoking temporary suspension of claims processing.
(iii) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may suspend CHAMPUS claims processing without first notifying the provider or beneficiary of the intent to suspend payments. Following a decision to invoke a temporary suspension, however, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue written notice advising the provider or beneficiary that:
(A) A temporary suspension of claims processing has been ordered and a statement of the basis of the decision to suspend payment. Unless the suspension is based on any of the actions set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the notice shall describe the suspected acts or omissions in terms sufficient to place the provider or beneficiary on notice without disclosing the Government's evidence.
(B) Within 30 days (or, upon written request received by OCHAMPUS during the 30 days and for good cause shown, within 60 days) from the date of the notice, the provider or beneficiary may:
(
1
) Submit to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, in writing, information (including documentary evidence) and argument in opposition to the suspension, provided the additional specific information raises a genuine dispute over the material facts, or
(
2
) Submit a written request to present in person evidence or argument
to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. All such presentations shall be made at the Office of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS) in Aurora, Colorado, at the provider's or beneficiary's own expense.
(C) Additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts may be conducted unless:
(
1
) The suspension is based on any of the actions set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, or,
(
2
) A determination is made, on the basis of the advice of the responsible Government official (e.g., an official of the Department of Justice, the designated Reviewing Official under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, etc.), that the substantial interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal or administrative proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced.
(iv) If the beneficiary or provider submits, either in writing or in person, additional information or argument in opposition to the suspension, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue a suspending official's decision which modifies, terminates, or leaves in force the suspension of claims processing. However, a decision to terminate or modify the suspension shall be without prejudice to the subsequent imposition of suspension of claims processing, imposition of sanctions under this § 199.9, the recovery of erroneous payments under § 199.11 of this part, or any other administrative or legal action authorized by law or regulation. The suspending official's decision shall be in writing as follows:
(A) A written decision based on all the information in the administrative record, including any submission by the beneficiary or provider, shall be final in a case:
(
1
) Based on any of the actions set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section,
(
2
) In which the beneficiary's or provider's submission does not raise a genuine dispute over material facts, or
(
3
) In which additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of advice of a responsible Government official that the substantial interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal or administrative proceedings would be prejudiced.
(B) In a case in which additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed material facts, the suspending official's decision shall advise the beneficiary or provider that the case has been referred for handling as a hearing under § 199.10 of this part.
(v) A suspension of claims processing may be modified or terminated for reasons such as:
(A) Newly discovered evidence;
(B) Elimination of any of the causes for which the suspension was invoked; or
(C) Other reasons the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, deems appropriate.
(vi) A suspension of claims processing shall be for a temporary period pending the completion of investigation and any ensuing legal or administrative proceedings, unless sooner terminated by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, or as provided in this subparagraph.
(A) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall be terminated unless the Government official responsible for initiation of the legal or administrative action requests its extension, in which case it may be extended for an additional 6 months. In no event may a suspension extend beyond 18 months, unless legal or administrative proceedings have been initiated during that period.
(B) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall notify the Government official responsible for initiation of the legal or administrative action of the proposed termination of the suspension, at least 30 days before the 12-month period expires, to give the official an opportunity to request an extension.
(2)
Notice of proposed administrative sanction.
(i) A provider shall be notified in writing of the proposed action to exclude, suspend, or terminate the provider's status as an authorized CHAMPUS provider.
(A) The notice shall state which sanction will be taken and the effective date of that sanction as determined in
accordance with the provisions of this part.
(B) The notice shall inform the provider of the situation(s), circumstance(s), or action(s) which form the basis for the proposed sanction and reference the paragraph of this part under which the administrative action is being taken.
(C) The notice will be sent to the provider's last known business or office address (or home address if there is no known business address.)
(D) The notice shall offer the provider an opportunity to respond within 30 days (or, upon written request received by OCHAMPUS during the 30 days and for good cause shown, within 60 days) from the date on the notice with either:
(
1
) Documentary evidence and written argument contesting the proposed action; or,
(
2
) A written request to present in person evidence or argument to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. All such presentations shall be made at the Office of the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS) in Aurora, Colorado, at the provider's own expense.
(3)
Initial determination.
(i) If, after the provider has exhausted, or failed to comply with, the procedures specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, decides to invoke an administrative remedy of exclusion, suspension, or termination of a provider under CHAMPUS, written notice of the decision will be sent to the provider by certified mail. Except in those cases where the sanction has a retroactive effective date, the written notice shall be dated no later than 15 days before the decision becomes effective. For terminations under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the initial determination may be issued without first implementing or exhausting the procedures specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(ii) The initial determination shall include:
(A) A statement of the sanction being invoked;
(B) A statement of the effective date of the sanction;
(C) A statement of the facts, circumstances, or actions which form the basis for the sanction and a discussion of any information submitted by the provider relevant to the sanction;
(D) A statement of the factors considered in determining the period of sanction;
(E) The earliest date on which a request for reinstatement under CHAMPUS will be accepted;
(F) The requirements and procedures for reinstatement; and,
(G) Notice of the available hearing upon request of the sanctioned provider.
(4)
Reinstatement procedures
—(i)
Restitution.
(A) There is no entitlement under CHAMPUS for payment (cost-sharing) of any claim that involves either criminal or civil fraud as defined by law, or fraud or abuse or conflict of interest as defined by this part. In addition, except as specifically provided in this part, there is no entitlement under CHAMPUS for payment (cost-sharing) of any claim for services or supplies furnished by a provider who does not meet the requirements to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. In any of the situations described above, CHAMPUS payment shall be denied whether the claim is submitted by the provider as a participating claim or by the beneficiary for reimbursement. If an erroneous payment has been issued in any such case, collection of the payment will be processed under § 199.11 of this part.
(B) If the Government has made erroneous payments to a provider because of claims involving fraud, abuse, or conflicts of interest, restitution of the erroneous payments shall be made before a request for reinstatement as a CHAMPUS authorized provider will be considered. Without restitution or resolution of the debt under § 199.11 of this part, a provider shall not be reinstated as an authorized CHAMPUS provider. This is not an appealable issue under § 199.10 of this part.
(C) For purposes of authorization as a CHAMPUS provider, a provider who is excluded or suspended under this § 199.9 and who submits participating claims for services furnished on or after the effective date of the exclusion or suspension is considered to have forfeited
or waived any right or entitlement to bill the beneficiary for the care involved in the claims. Similarly, because a provider is expected to know the CHAMPUS requirements for qualification as an authorized provider, any participating provider who fails to meet the qualification requirements for CHAMPUS is considered to have forfeited or waived any right or entitlement to bill the beneficiary for the care involved in the CHAMPUS claims. If, in either situation, the provider bills the beneficiary, restitution to the beneficiary may be required by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, as a condition for consideration of reinstatement as a CHAMPUS authorized provider.
(ii)
Terminated providers.
A terminated provider who subsequently achieves the minimum qualifications to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider or who has had his/her license reinstated or the impediment to reinstatement removed by the appropriate licensing jurisdiction may submit a written request for reinstatement under CHAMPUS to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. If restitution or proper reinstatement of license is not at issue, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will process the request for reinstatement under the procedures established for initial requests for authorized CHAMPUS provider status.
(iii)
Providers (other than entities) excluded or suspended under CHAMPUS.
(A) A provider excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS (other than an entity excluded under § 199.9(f)(1)(i)) may seek reinstatement by submitting a written request to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, any time after the date specified in the notice of exclusion or suspension or any earlier date specified in an appeal decision issued in the provider's appeal under § 199.10 of this part. The request for reinstatement shall include:
(
1
) Documentation sufficient to establish the provider's qualifications under this part to be a CHAMPUS authorized provider;
(
2
) A statement from the provider setting forth the reasons why the provider should be reinstated, accompanied by written statements from professional associates, peer review bodies, and/or probation officers (if appropriate), attesting to their belief that the violations that led to exclusion or suspension will not be repeated.
(B) A provider entity excluded from CHAMPUS under § 199.9(f)(1)(i) may seek reinstatement by submitting a written request to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, with documentation sufficient to establish the provider's qualifications under this part to be a CHAMPUS authorized provider and either:
(
1
) Documentation showing the CHAMPUS reinstatement of the excluded individual provider whose conviction led to the CHAMPUS exclusion or suspension of the provider entity;
or
(
2
) Documentation acceptable to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, that shows that the individual whose conviction led to the entity's exclusion:
(
i
) Has reduced his or her ownership or control interest in the entity below 5 percent; or
(
ii
) Is no longer an officer, director, agent or managing employee of the entity; or
(
iii
) Continues to maintain a 5 percent or more ownership or control interest in such entity, and that the entity due to circumstances beyond its control, is unable to obtain a divestiture.

# Note:
Under paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section, the request for reinstatement may be submitted any time prior to the date specified in the notice of exclusion or suspension or an earlier date specified in the appeal decision issued under § 199.10 of this part.
(iv)
Action on request for reinstatement.
In order to reinstate a provider as a CHAMPUS authorized provider, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, must determine that:
(A) The provider meets all requirements under this part to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider;
(B) No additional criminal, civil, or administrative action has been taken or is being considered which could subject the provider to exclusion, suspension, or termination under this section;
(C) In the case of a provider entity, verification has been made of the divestiture or termination of the owner,
controlling party, officer, director, agent or managing employee whose conviction led to the entity's exclusion,
or
that the provider entity should be reinstated because the entity, due to circumstances beyond its control, cannot obtain a divestiture of the 5 percent or more ownership or controlling interest by the convicted party.
(v)
Notice of action on request for reinstatement
—(A)
Notice of approval of request.
If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, approves the request for reinstatement, he or she will:
(
1
) Give written notice to the sanctioned party specifying the date when the authorized provider status under CHAMPUS may resume; and
(
2
) Give notice to those agencies and groups that were originally notified, in accordance with § 199.9(k), of the imposition of the sanction. General notice may also be given to beneficiaries and other parties as deemed appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(B)
Notice of denial of request.
If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, does not approve the request for reinstatement, written notice will be given to the provider. If established procedures for processing initial requests for authorized provider status are used to review the request for reinstatement, the established procedures may be used to provide the notice that the provider does not meet requirements of this part for such status. If the provider continues to be excluded, suspended, or terminated under the provisions of this section, the procedures set forth in this paragraph (h) may be followed in denying the provider's request for reinstatement.
(5)
Reversed or vacated convictions or civil judgments involving CHAMPUS fraud.
(i) If a CHAMPUS provider is excluded or suspended
solely
on the basis of a criminal conviction or civil judgment involving a CHAMPUS fraud and the conviction or judgment is reversed or vacated on appeal, CHAMPUS will void the exclusion of a provider. Such action will not preclude the initiation of additional independent administrative action under this section or any other administrative remedy based on the same facts or events which were the subject of the criminal conviction or civil judgment.
(ii) If an exclusion is voided under paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section, CHAMPUS will make payment, either to the provider or the beneficiary (if the claim was not a participating claim) for otherwise authorized services under CHAMPUS that are furnished or performed during the period of exclusion.
(iii) CHAMPUS will also void the exclusion of any entity that was excluded under § 199.9(f)(1)(i) based
solely
on an individual's conviction that has been reversed or vacated on appeal.
(iv) When CHAMPUS voids the exclusion of a provider or an entity, notice will be given to the agencies and others that were originally notified, in accordance with § 199.9(k).
(i)
Evidence required for determinations to invoke administrative remedies
—(1)
General.
Any relevant evidence may be used by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule that might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil or criminal courts.
(2)
Types of evidence.
The types of evidence which the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may rely on in reaching a determination to invoke administrative remedies under this section include but are not limited to the following:
(i) Results of audits conducted by or on behalf of the Government. Such audits can include the results of 100 percent review of claims and related records or a statistically valid sample audit of the claims or records. A statistical sampling shall constitute
prima facie
evidence of the number and amount of claims and the instances of fraud, abuse, or conflict of interest.
(ii) Reports, including sanction reports, from various sources including a peer review organization (PRO) for the area served by the provider; state or local licensing or certification authorities; peer or medical review consultants of the Government, including consultants for Government contractors; state or local professional societies; or
other sources deemed appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(iii) Orders or documents issued by Federal, state, foreign, or other courts of competent jurisdiction which issue findings and/or criminal convictions or civil judgments involving the provider, and administrative rulings, findings, or determinations by any agency of the Federal Government, a state, or local licensing or certification authority regarding the provider's status with that agency or authority.
(j)
Suspending Administrative Action.
(1) All or any administrative action may be suspended by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, pending action in the case by the Department of Defense—Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, or the Department of Justice (including the responsible United States Attorney). However, action by the Department of Defense—Inspector General or the Department of Justice, including investigation, criminal prosecution, or civil litigation, does not preclude administrative action by OCHAMPUS.
(2) The normal OCHAMPUS procedure is to suspend action on the administrative process pending an investigation by the Department of Defense—Inspector General or final disposition by the Department of Justice.
(3) Though OCHAMPUS administrative action is taken independently of any action by the Department of Defense-Inspector General or by the Department of Justice, once a case is forwarded to the Department of Defense-Inspector General or the Department of Justice for legal action (criminal or civil), administrative action may be held in abeyance.
(4) In some instances there may be dual jurisdiction between agencies; as in, for example, the joint regulations issued by the Department of Justice and the Government Accounting Office regarding debt collection.
(k)
Notice to Other Agencies.
(1) When CHAMPUS excludes, suspends, or terminates a provider, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will notify other appropriate agencies (for example, the Department of Health and Human Services and the state licensing agency that issued the provider's license to practice) that the individual has been excluded, suspended, or terminated as an authorized provider under CHAMPUS. An exclusion, suspension, or termination action is considered a public record. Such notice can include the notices and determinations sent to the suspended provider and other public documents such as testimony given at a hearing or exhibits or depositions given in a lawsuit or hearing. Notice may also be given to Uniformed Services Military Treatment Facilities, Health Benefit Advisors, beneficiaries and sponsors, the news media, and institutional providers if inpatient care was involved.
(2) If CHAMPUS has temporarily suspended claims processing, notice of such action normally will be given to the affected provider and Uniformed Services Medical Treatment Facilities, Health Benefits Advisors, beneficiaries, and sponsors. Notice may also be given to any information or news media and any other individual, professional provider, or institutional provider, as deemed appropriate. However, since a “temporary suspension of claims processing” is by definition not a final or formal agency action, the basis for the action generally will not be disclosed. It is noted that the basis for the action can be a result of questions arising from routine audits to investigation of possible criminal violations.
(l)
Compromise, Settlement, and Resolution Authority.
(1) In lieu of invoking any remedy provided by this Section, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may elect to enter into an agreement with the provider intended to correct the situation within an established time period and subject to any remedies deemed appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(2) When it is in the best interest of CHAMPUS, the Director, OCHAMPUS, has the discretionary authority to waive an action or enter into compromise or settlement of administrative actions taken under this § 199.9.
(m)
Government-wide effect of exclusion or suspension from CHAMPUS.
As provided by section 2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-355, October 13 1994, and Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension from Federal Financial and
Nonfinancial Assistance Programs,” February 18, 1986, any health care provider excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS under this section shall, as a general rule, also be debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from all other programs and activities involving Federal financial assistance. Among the other programs for which this debarment, suspension, or exclusion shall operate are the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This debarment, suspension, or termination requirement is subject to limited exceptions in the regulations governing the respective Federal programs affected. (Note: Other regulations related to this government-wide exclusion or suspension authority are 32 CFR Part 25 and 45 CFR Part 76.)
(n) Third-party billing agents as defined in § 199.2(b) of this part, while not considered providers, are subject to the provisions of this section to the same extent as such provisions apply to providers.
[54 FR 25246, June 14, 1989, as amended at 63 FR 48445, Sept. 10, 1998; 78 FR 12954, Feb. 26, 2013; 85 FR 60705, Sept. 28, 2020]
§ 199.10
Appeal and hearing procedures.
(a)
General.
This Section sets forth the policies and procedures for appealing decisions made by OCHAMPUS, OCHAMPUSEUR, and CHAMPUS contractors adversely affecting the rights and liabilities of CHAMPUS beneficiaries, CHAMPUS participating providers, and providers denied the status of authorized provider under CHAMPUS. An appeal under CHAMPUS is an administrative review of program determinations made under the provisions of law and regulation. An appeal cannot challenge the propriety, equity, or legality of any provision of law or regulation.
(1)
Initial determination
—(i)
Notice of initial determination and right to appeal.
(A) OCHAMPUS, OCHAMPUSEUR, and CHAMPUS contractors shall mail notices of initial determinations to the affected provider or CHAMPUS beneficiary (or representative) at the last known address. For beneficiaries who are under 18 years of age or who are incompetent, a notice issued to the parent, guardian, or other representative, under established CHAMPUS procedures, constitutes notice to the beneficiary.
(B) CHAMPUS contractors and OCHAMPUSEUR shall notify a provider of an initial determination on a claim only if the provider participated in the claim. (See § 199.7 of this part.)
(C) CHAMPUS peer review organizations shall notify providers and fiscal intermediaries of a denial determination on a claim.
(D) Notice of an initial determination on a claim processed by a CHAMPUS contractor or OCHAMPUSEUR normally will be made on a CHAMPUS Explanation of Benefits (CEOB) form.
(E) Each notice of an initial determination on a request for benefit authorization, a request by a provider for approval as an authorized CHAMPUS provider, or a decision to disqualify or exclude a provider as an authorized provider under CHAMPUS shall state the reason for the determination and the underlying facts supporting the determination.
(F) In any case when the initial determination is adverse to the beneficiary or participating provider, or to the provider seeking approval as an authorized CHAMPUS provider, the notice shall include a statement of the beneficiary's or provider's right to appeal the determination. The procedure for filing the appeal also shall be explained.
(ii)
Effect of initial determination.
(A) The initial determination is final unless appealed in accordance with this chapter, or unless the initial determination is reopened by the TRICARE Management Activity, the CHAMPUS contractor, or the CHAMPUS peer review organization.
(B) An initial determination involving a CHAMPUS beneficiary entitled to Medicare Part A, who is enrolled in Medicare Part B, may be appealed by the beneficiary or their provider under this section of this Part only when the claimed services or supplies are payable by CHAMPUS and are not payable under Medicare. Both Medicare and CHAMPUS offer an appeal process when a claim for healthcare services or supplies is denied and most healthcare
services and supplies are a benefit payable under both Medicare and CHAMPUS. In order to avoid confusion on the part of beneficiaries and providers and to expedite the appeal process, services and supplies denied payment by Medicare will not be considered for coverage by CHAMPUS if the Medicare denial of payment is appealable under Medicare. Because such claims are not considered for payment by CHAMPUS, there can be no CHAMPUS appeal. If, however, a Medicare claim or appeal results in some payment by Medicare, the services and supplies paid by Medicare will be considered for payment by CHAMPUS. In that situation, any decision to deny CHAMPUS payment will be appealable under this section. The following examples of CHAMPUS appealable issues involving Medicare-eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries are illustrative; they are not all-inclusive.
(
1
) If Medicare processes a claim for a healthcare service or supply that is a Medicare benefit and the claim is denied by Medicare for a patient-specific reason, the claim is appealable through the Medicare appeal process. The Medicare decision will be final if the claim is denied by Medicare. The claimed services or supplies will not be considered for CHAMPUS payment and there is no CHAMPUS appeal of the CHAMPUS decision denying the claim.
(
2
) If Medicare processes a claim for a healthcare service or supply that is a Medicare benefit and the claim is paid, either on initial submission or as a result of a Medicare appeal decision, the claim will be submitted to CHAMPUS for processing as a second payer to Medicare. If CHAMPUS denies payment of the claim, the Medicare-eligible beneficiary or their provider have the same appeal rights as other CHAMPUS beneficiaries and their providers under this section.
(
3
) If Medicare processes a claim and the claim is denied by Medicare because it is not a healthcare service or supply that is a benefit under Medicare, the claim is submitted to CHAMPUS. CHAMPUS will process the claim under this Part 199 as primary payer (or as secondary payer if another double coverage plan exists). If any part of the claim is denied, the Medicare-eligible beneficiary and their provider will have the same appeal rights as other CHAMPUS beneficiaries and their providers under this section.
(2)
Participation in an appeal.
Participation in an appeal is limited to any party to the initial determination, including CHAMPUS, and authorized representatives of the parties. Any party to the initial determination, except CHAMPUS, may appeal an adverse determination. The appealing party is the party who actually files the appeal.
(i)
Parties to the initial determination.
For purposes of the CHAMPUS appeals and hearing procedures, the following are not parties to an initial determination and are not entitled to administrative review under this section.
(A) A provider disqualified or excluded as an authorized provider under CHAMPUS based on a determination of abuse or fraudulent practices or procedures under another Federal or federally funded program is not a party to the CHAMPUS action and may not appeal under this section.
(B) A beneficiary who has an interest in receiving care or has received care from a particular provider cannot be an appealing party regarding the exclusion, suspension, or termination of the provider under § 199.9 of this part.
(C) A sponsor or parent of a beneficiary under 18 years of age or guardian or an incompetent beneficiary is not a party to the initial determination and may not serve as the appealing party, although such persons may represent the appealing party in an appeal.
(D) A third party, such as an insurance company, is not a party to the initial determination and is not entitled to appeal even though it may have an indirect interest in the initial determination.
(E) A nonparticipating provider is not a party to the initial determination and may not appeal.
(ii)
Representative.
Any party to the initial determination may appoint a representative to act on behalf of the party in connection with an appeal. Generally, the parent of a minor beneficiary and the legally appointed guardian of an incompetent beneficiary shall be presumed to have been appointed representative without specific
designation by the beneficiary. The custodial parent or legal guardian (appointed by a cognizant court) of a minor beneficiary may initiate an appeal based on the above presumption. However, should a minor beneficiary turn 18 years of age during the course of an appeal, then any further requests to appeal on behalf of the beneficiary must be from the beneficiary or pursuant to the written authorization of the beneficiary appointing a representative. For example, if the beneficiary is 17 years of age and the sponsor (who is a custodial parent) requests a formal review, absent written objection by the minor beneficiary, the sponsor is presumed to be acting on behalf of the minor beneficiary. Following the issuance of the formal review, the sponsor requests a hearing; however if, at the time of the request for a hearing, the beneficiary is 18 years of age or older, the request must either be by the beneficiary or the beneficiary must appoint a representative. The sponsor, in this example, could not pursue the request for hearing without being appointed by the beneficiary as the beneficiary's representative.
(A) The representative shall have the same authority as the party to the appeal and notice given to the representative shall constitute notice required to be given to the party under this part.
(B) To avoid possible conflicts of interest, an officer or employee of the United States, such as an employee or member of a Uniformed Service, including an employee or staff member of a Uniformed Service legal office, or a CHAMPUS advisor, subject to the exceptions in 18 U.S.C. 205, is not eligible to serve as a representative. An exception usually is made for an employee or member of a Uniformed Service who represents an immediate family member. In addition, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may appoint an officer or employee of the United States as the CHAMPUS representative at a hearing.
(3)
Burden of proof.
The burden of proof is on the appealing party to establish affirmatively by substantial evidence the appealing party's entitlement under law and this part to the authorization of CHAMPUS benefits, approval of authorized CHAMPUS provider status, or removal of sanctions imposed under § 199.9 of this part. If a presumption exists under the provisions of this part or information constitutes
prima facie
evidence under the provisions of this part, the appealing party must produce evidence reasonably sufficient to rebut the presumption or
prima facie
evidence as part of the appealing party's burden of proof. CHAMPUS shall not pay any part of the cost or fee, including attorney fees, associated with producing or submitting evidence in support of an appeal.
(4)
Evidence in appeal and hearing cases.
Any relevant evidence may be used in the administrative appeal and hearing process if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule that might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil or criminal courts.
(5)
Late filing.
If a request for reconsideration, formal review, or hearings is filed after the time permitted in this section, written notice shall be issued denying the request. Late filing may be permitted only if the appealing party reasonably can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, that the timely filing of the request was not feasible due to extraordinary circumstances over which the appealing party had no practical control. Each request for an exception to the filing requirement will be considered on its own merits. The decision of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, on the request for an exception to the filing requirement shall be final.
(6)
Appealable issue.
An appealable issue is required in order for an adverse determination to be appealed under the provisions of this section. Examples of issues that are not appealable under this section include:
(i) A dispute regarding a requirement of the law or regulation.
(ii) The amount of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost or charge, since the methodology for determining allowable costs or charges is established by this part.
(iii) The establishment of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), or the methodology for the classification of inpatient discharges within the DRGs, or the weighting factors that reflect the relative hospital resources used with respect to discharges within each DRG, since each of these is established by this part.
(iv) Certain other issues on the basis that the authority for the initial determination is not vested in CHAMPUS. Such issues include but are not limited to the following examples:
(A) Determination of a person's eligibility as a CHAMPUS beneficiary is the responsibility of the appropriate Uniformed Service. Although OCHAMPUS, OCHAMPUSEUR, and CHAMPUS contractors must make determinations concerning a beneficiary's eligibility in order to ensure proper disbursement of appropriated funds on each CHAMPUS claim processed, ultimate responsibility for resolving a beneficiary's eligibility rests with the Uniformed Services. Accordingly, disputed question of fact concerning a beneficiary's eligibility will not be considered an appealable issue under the provisions of this section, but shall be resolved in accordance with § 199.3 of this part.
(B) Similarly, decisions relating to the issuance of a Nonavailability Statement (DD Form 1251) in each case are made by the Uniformed Services. Disputes over the need for a Nonavailability Statement or a refusal to issue a Nonavailability Statement are not appealable under this section. The one exception is when a dispute arises over whether the facts of the case demonstrate a medical emergency for which a Nonavailability Statement is not required. Denial of payment in this one situation is an appealable issue.
(C) Any sanction, including the period of the sanction, imposed under § 199.9 of this part which is based solely on a provider's exclusion or suspension by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or a local licensing authority is not appealable under this section. The provider must exhaust administrative appeal rights offered by the other agency that made the initial determination to exclude or suspend the provider. Similarly, any sanction imposed under § 199.9 which is based solely on a criminal conviction or civil judgment against the provider is not appealable under this section. If the sanction imposed under § 199.9 is not based solely on the provider's criminal conviction or civil judgment or on the provider's exclusion or suspension by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or a local licensing authority, that portion of the CHAMPUS administrative determination which is in addition to the criminal conviction/civil judgment or exclusion/suspension by the other agency may be appealed under this section.
(v) A decision by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, as a suspending official when the decision is final under the provisions of § 199.9(h)(1)(iv)(A).
(7)
Amount in dispute.
An amount in dispute is required for an adverse determination to be appealed under the provisions of this section, except as set forth below.
(i) The amount in dispute is calculated as the amount of money CHAMPUS would pay if the services and supplies involved in dispute were determined to be authorized CHAMPUS benefits. Examples of amounts of money that are excluded by the Regulation from CHAMPUS payments for authorized benefits include, but are not limited to:
(A) Amounts in excess of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost.
(B) The beneficiary's CHAMPUS deductible and cost-share amounts.
(C) Amounts that the CHAMPUS beneficiary, or parent, guardian, or other responsible person has no legal obligation to pay.
(D) Amounts excluded under the provisions of § 199.8 of this part.
(ii) The amount of dispute for appeals involving a denial of a request for authorization in advance of obtaining care shall be the estimated allowable charge or cost for the services requested.
(iii) There is no requirement for an amount in dispute when the appealable issue involves a denial of a provider's request for approval as an authorized CHAMPUS provider or the determination to exclude, suspend, or terminate
a provider's authorized CHAMPUS provider status.
(iv) Individual claims may be combined to meet the required amount in dispute if all of the following exist:
(A) The claims involve the same beneficiary.
(B) The claims involve the same issue.
(C) At least one of the claims so combined has had a reconsideration decision issued by OCHAMPUSEUR, a CHAMPUS contractor, or a CHAMPUS peer review organization.

# Note:
A request for administrative review under this appeal process which involves a dispute regarding a requirement of law or regulation (paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section) or does not involve a sufficient amount in dispute (paragraph (a)(7) of this section) may not be rejected at the reconsideration level of appeal. However, an appeal shall involve an appealable issue and sufficient amount in dispute under these paragraphs to be granted a formal review or hearing.
(8)

Appeal decision.
An appeal decision at any level may address all pertinent issues which arise under the appeal or are otherwise presented by the information in the case record (for example, the entire episode of care in the appeal), and shall not be limited to addressing the specific issue appealed by a party. In the case of sanctions imposed under § 199.9, the final decision may affirm, increase or reduce the sanction period imposed by CHAMPUS, or otherwise modify or reverse the imposition of the sanction.

the initial determination and/or reconsideration decision involving a provider request for approval as an authorized provider under CHAMPUS. The reconsideration is performed by a member of the OCHAMPUSEUR, CHAMPUS contractor, or CHAMPUS peer review organization staff who was not involved in making the initial determination and is a thorough and independent review of the case. The reconsideration is based on the information submitted that led to the initial determination, plus any additional information that the appealing party may submit or OCHAMPUSEUR, the CHAMPUS contractor, or CHAMPUS peer review organization may obtain.
(3)

A hearing, except for an appeal involving a provider sanction, generally shall be conducted as a nonadversary, administrative proceeding. However, an authorized party to any hearing, including CHAMPUS, may submit additional evidence or testimony relevant to the appealable issue(s) and may appoint a representative, including legal counsel, to participate in the hearing process.
(3)
Timeliness of hearing.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in this section, within 60 days following receipt of a request for hearing, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, normally will appoint a hearing officer to hear the appeal.

A hearing officer voluntarily shall disqualify himself or herself and withdraw from any proceeding in which the hearing officer cannot give fair or impartial hearing, or in which there is a conflict of interest. A party to the hearing may request the disqualification of a hearing officer by filing a statement detailing the reasons the party believes that a fair and impartial hearing cannot be given or that a conflict of interest exists. Such request immediately shall be sent by the appealing party or the hearing officer to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, who shall investigate the allegations and advise the complaining party of the decision in writing.

A dismissal for cause may be issued under any of the following circumstances:
(A) When the appealing party requesting the hearing is not a proper party under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, or does not otherwise have a right to participate in a hearing.
(B) When the appealing party who filed the hearing request dies, and there is no information before the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, showing that a party to the initial determination who is not an appealing party may be prejudiced by the formal review determination.

The written request shall state clearly what information and documents are required for inspection and the relevance of the documents to the issues in the proceeding. Depositions, interrogatories, requests for admissions, and other forms of prehearing discovery are generally not authorized and the Department of Defense does not have subpoena authority for purposes of administrative hearings under this Section. If the hearing officer finds that good cause exists for taking a deposition or interrogatory, the expense shall be assessed to the requesting party, with copies furnished to the hearing officer and the other party or parties to the hearing.

All parties to a hearing are responsible for producing, at each party's expense, meaning without reimbursement of payment by CHAMPUS, witnesses and other evidence in their own behalf, and for furnishing copies of any such documentary evidence to the hearing officer and other party or parties to the hearing. The Department of Defense is not authorized to subpoena witnesses or records. The hearing officer may issue invitations and requests to individuals to appear and testify without cost to the Government, so that the full facts in the case may be presented.

A verbatim taped record of the hearing shall be made and shall become a permanent part of the record. Upon request, the
appealing party shall be furnished a duplicate copy of the tape. A typed transcript of the testimony will be made only when determined to be necessary by OCHAMPUS. If a typed transcript is made, the appealing party shall be furnished a copy without charge. Corrections shall be allowed in the typed transcript by the hearing officer solely for the purpose of conforming the transcript to the actual testimony.
(xii)
Waiver of right to appear and present evidence.
If all parties waive their right to appear before the hearing officer for presenting evidence and contentions personally or by representation, it will not be necessary for the hearing officer to give notice of, or to conduct a formal hearing. A waiver of the right to appear must be in writing and filed with the hearing officer or the Chief, Appeals and Hearings, OCHAMPUS. Such waiver may be withdrawn by the party by written notice received by the hearing officer or Chief, Appeals and Hearings, no later than 7 days before the scheduled hearing or the mailing of notice of the final decision, whichever occurs first. For purposes of this Section, failure of a party to appear personally or by representation after filing written notice of waiver, will not be cause for finding of abandonment and the hearing officer shall make the recommended decision on the basis of all evidence of record.
(12)
Recommended decision.
At the conclusion of the hearing and after the record has been closed, the matter shall be taken under consideration by the hearing officer. Within the time frames previously set forth in this Section, the hearing officer shall submit to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, a written recommended decision containing a statement of findings and a statement of reasons based on the evidence adduced at the hearing and otherwise included in the hearing record.
(i)
Statement of findings.
A statement of findings is a clear and concise statement of fact evidenced in the record or conclusions that readily can be deduced from the evidence of record. Each finding must be supported by substantial evidence that is defined as such evidence as a reasonable mind can accept as adequate to support a conclusion.
(ii)
Statement of reasons.
A reason is a clear and concise statement of law, regulation, policies, or guidelines relating to the statement of findings that provides the basis for the recommended decision.
(e)
Final decision
—(1)
Director, OCHAMPUS.
The recommended decision shall be reviewed by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, who shall adopt or reject the recommended decision or refer the recommended decision for review by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, normally will take action with regard to the recommended decision within 90 days of receipt of the recommended decision or receipt of the revised recommended decision following a remand order to the Hearing Officer.
(i)
Final action.
If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, concurs in the recommended decision, no further agency action is required and the recommended decision, as adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS, is the final agency decision in the appeal. In the case of rejection, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall state the reason for disagreement with the recommended decision and the underlying facts supporting such disagreement. In these circumstances, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may have a final decision prepared based on the record, or may remand the matter to the Hearing Officer for appropriate action. In the latter instance, the Hearing Officer shall take appropriate action and submit a new recommended decision within 60 days of receipt of the remand order. The decision by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, concerning a case arising under the procedures of this section, shall be the final agency decision and the final decision shall be sent by certified mail to the appealing party or parties. A final agency decision under paragraph (e)(1) of this section will not be relied on, used, or cited as precedent by the Department of Defense in the administration of CHAMPUS.
(ii)
Referral for review by ASD(HA).
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may refer a hearing case to the
Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) when the hearing involves the resolution of CHAMPUS policy and issuance of a final decision which may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent in the administration of CHAMPUS. In such a circumstance, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall forward the recommended decision, together with the recommendation of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, regarding disposition of the hearing case.
(2)
ASD(HA).
The ASD(HA), or a designee, after reviewing a case arising under the procedures of this section may issue a final decision based on the record in the hearing case or remand the case to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, for appropriate action. A decision issued by the ASD(HA), or a designee, shall be the final agency decision in the appeal and a copy of the final decision shall be sent by certified mail to the appealing party or parties. A final decision of the ASD(HA), or a designee, issued under this paragraph (e)(2) may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent in the administration of CHAMPUS.

§ 199.11
Overpayments recovery.
(a)
General.
Actions to recover overpayments arise when the government has a right to recover money, funds, or property from any person, partnership, association, corporation, governmental body or other legal entity, foreign or domestic, except another Federal agency, because of an erroneous payment of benefits under both CHAMPUS and the TRICARE program under this part. The term “Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services” (CHAMPUS) is defined in 10 U.S.C. 1072(2), referred to as the CHAMPUS basic program. Prior to January 1, 2018, the term “TRICARE program” referred to the triple-option of health benefits known as TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Extra, and TRICARE Standard. Specifically, TRICARE Standard was the TRICARE program under which the basic program of health care benefits generally referred to as CHAMPUS was made available to eligible beneficiaries under this Part 199. Effective January 1, 2018, the term “TRICARE program” is defined in 10 U.S.C. 1072(2) and includes TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select and TRICARE for Life. It is the purpose of this section to prescribe procedures for investigation, determination, assertion, collection, compromise, waiver and termination of claims in favor of the United States for erroneous benefit payments arising out of the administration CHAMPUS and the TRICARE program. For the purpose of this section, references herein to TRICARE beneficiaries, claims, benefits, payments, or appeals shall include CHAMPUS beneficiaries, claims, benefits, payments, or appeals. A claim against several joint debtors arising from a single incident or transaction is considered one claim. The Director, or a designee, may pursue collection against all joint debtors and is not required to allocate the burden of payment between debtors.
(b)
Authority
—(1)
Federal statutory authority.
The Federal Claims Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3701,
et seq.,
as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), provides the basic authority under which claims may be asserted pursuant to this section. The DCIA is implemented by the Federal Claims Collection Standards, joint regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) (31 CFR Parts 900-904), that prescribe government-wide standards for administrative collection, offset, compromise, suspension, or termination of agency collection action, disclosure of debt information to credit reporting agencies, referral of debts to private collection contractors for resolution, and referral to the Department of Justice for litigation to collect debts owed the Federal government. The regulations under this part are also issued under Treasury regulations implementing the DCIA (31 CFR part 285) and related statutes and regulations governing the offset of Federal salaries (5 U.S.C. 5514;
5 CFR part 550, subpart K), administrative offset (31 U.S.C. 3716; 31 CFR part 285, subpart A); administrative offset of tax refunds (31 U.S.C. 3720A) and offset of military pay (37 U.S.C. 1007(c); Volume 7A, Chapter 50 and Volume 7B, Chapter 28 of the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation, DOD 7000.14-R
1
(DoDFMR)).

(2)
Other authority.
Federal claims may arise under authorities other than the federal statutes, referenced above. These include, but are not limited to:
(i) State worker's compensation laws.
(ii) State hospital lien laws.
(iii) State no-fault automobile statutes.
(iv) Contract rights under terms of insurance policies.
(c)
Policy.
The Director, TMA, or a designee, shall aggressively collect all debts arising out of its activities. Claims arising out of any incident, which has or probably will generate a claim in favor of the government, will not be compromised, except as otherwise provided in this section, nor will any person not authorized to take final action on the government's claim, compromise or terminate collection action. Title 28 U.S.C. 2415-2416 establishes a statute of limitation applicable to the government where previously neither limitations nor latches were available as a defense. Claims falling within the provisions of this statute will be referred to the Department of Justice without attempting administrative collection action, if such action cannot be accomplished in sufficient time to preclude the running of the statute of limitations.
(d)
Appealability.
This section describes the procedures to be followed in the recovery and collection of federal claims in favor of the United States arising from the operation of TRICARE. Actions taken under this section are not initial determinations for the purpose of the appeal procedures of § 199.10 of this part. However, the proper exercise of the right to appeal benefit or provider status determinations under the procedures set forth in § 199.10 of this part may affect the processing of federal claims arising under this section. Those appeal procedures afford a TRICARE beneficiary or participating provider an opportunity for administrative appellate review in cases in which benefits have been denied and in which there is an appealable issue. For example, a TRICARE contractor may erroneously make payment for services, which are excluded as TRICARE benefits because they are determined to be not medically necessary. In that event, the contractor will initiate recoupment action, and at the same time, the contractor will offer an administrative appeal as provided in § 199.10 of this part on the medical necessity issue raised by the adverse benefit determination. The recoupment action and the administrative appeal are separate actions. However, in an appropriate case, the pendency of the appeal may provide a basis for the suspension of collection in the recoupment case. If an appeal were resolved entirely in favor of the appealing party, it would provide a basis for the termination of collection action in the recoupment case.
(e)
Delegation.
Subject to the limitations imposed by law or contained in this section, the authority to assert, settle, and compromise or to suspend or terminate collection action arising on claims under the Federal Claims Collection Act has been delegated to the Director, TMA, or a designee.
(f)
Recoupment of erroneous payments.
(1) Erroneous payments are expenditures of government funds, which are not authorized by law or this part. Examples which are sometimes encountered in the administration of TRICARE include mathematical errors, payment for care provided to an ineligible person, payment for care which is not an authorized benefit, payment for duplicate claims, incorrect application of the deductible or co-payment or payment for services which were not medically necessary. Claims in favor of the government arising as the result of the filing of false TRICARE claims or other fraud fall under the cognizance of the Department of Justice. Consequently, procedures in this section apply to such claims only when specifically authorized or directed by the Department of Justice. (
See
31 CFR 900.3.) Due to the
nature of contractual agreements between network providers and TRICARE prime contractors, recoupment procedures may be modified or adapted to conform to network agreements. The provisions of § 199.11 shall apply if recoupment under the network agreements is not successful.
(2)
Scope
—(i)
General.
Paragraph (f) of this section and the paragraphs following contain requirements and procedures for the assertion, collection or compromise of, and the suspension or termination of collection action on claims for erroneous payments against a sponsor, patient, beneficiary, provider, physician or other supplier of products or services under TRICARE.
(ii)
Debtor defined.
As used herein, “debtor” means a sponsor, beneficiary, provider, physician, other supplier of services or supplies, or any other person who for any reason has been erroneously paid under TRICARE. It includes an individual, partnership, corporation, professional corporation or association, estate, trust or any other legal entity.
(iii)
Delinquency defined.
A debt is “delinquent” if it has not been paid by the date specified in the initial written demand for payment (that is, the initial written notification) or other applicable contractual agreement, unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made by the date specified in the initial written demand for payment. A debt is considered delinquent if at any time after entering into a repayment agreement, the debtor fails to satisfy any obligations under that agreement.
(3) Claims arising from erroneous TRICARE payments in situations where the beneficiary has entitlement to an insurance, medical service, health and medical plan, including any plan offered by a third party payer as defined in 10 U.S.C. 1095(h)(1) or other government program, except in the case of a plan administered under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396,
et seq.
) through employment, by law, through membership in an organization, or as a student, or through the purchase of a private insurance or health plan, shall be recouped following the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section. If the other plan has not made payment to the beneficiary or provider, the contractor shall first attempt to recover the overpayment from the other plan through the contractor's coordination of benefits procedures. If the overpayment cannot be recovered from the other plan, or if the other plan has made payment, the overpayment will be recovered from the party that received the erroneous payment from TRICARE. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require recoupment from any sponsor, beneficiary, provider, supplier and/or the Medicare Program under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act in the event of a retroactive determination of entitlement to SSDI and Medicare Part A coverage made by the Social Security Administration as discussed in § 199.8(d) of this part.
(4)
Claim denials due to clarification or change.
In those instances where claim review results in the denial of benefits previously provided, but now denied due to a change, clarification or interpretation of the public law or this part, no recoupment action need be taken to recover funds expended prior to the effective date of such change, clarification or interpretation.
(5)
Good faith payment.
(i) The Department of Defense, through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), is responsible for establishing and maintaining a file listing of persons eligible to receive benefits under TRICARE. However, it is the responsibility of the Uniformed Services to provide eligible TRICARE beneficiaries with accurate and appropriate means of identification. When sources of civilian medical care exercise reasonable care and precaution identifying persons claiming to be eligible TRICARE beneficiaries, and furnish otherwise covered services and supplies to such persons in good faith, TRICARE benefits may be paid subject to prior approval by the Director, TMA, or a designee, notwithstanding the fact that the person receiving the services and supplies is subsequently determined to be ineligible for benefits. Good faith payments will not be authorized for services and supplies provided by a civilian source of medical
care because of its own careless identification procedures.
(ii) When it is determined that a person was not a TRICARE beneficiary, the TRICARE contractor and the civilian source of medical care are expected to make all reasonable efforts to obtain payment or to recoup the amount of the good faith payment from the person who erroneously claimed to be the TRICARE beneficiary. Recoupment of good faith payments initiated by the TRICARE contractor will be processed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.
(6)
Recoupment procedures.
(i)
Initial action.
When an erroneous payment is discovered, the TRICARE contractor normally will be required to take the initial action to effect recoupment. Such actions will be in accordance with the provisions of this part and the TRICARE contracts and will include a demand (or demands) for refund or an offset against any other TRICARE payment(s) becoming due the debtor. When the efforts of the TRICARE contractor to effect recoupment are not successful within a reasonable time, recoupment cases will be referred to the Office of General Counsel, TMA, for further action in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. All requests to debtors for refund or notices of intent to offset shall be in writing.
(ii)
Demand for payment.
Written demand(s) for payment shall inform the debtor of the following:
(A) The basis for and amount of the debt and the consequences of failing to cooperate to resolve the debt;
(B) The right to inspect and copy TRICARE records pertaining to the debt;
(C) The opportunity to request an administrative review by the TRICARE contractor; and that such a request must be received by the TRICARE contractor within 90 days from the date of the initial demand letter;
(D) That payment of the debt is due within 30 days from the date of the initial demand notification;
(E) That interest will be assessed on the debt at the Treasury Current Value of Funds rate, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, and will begin to accrue on the date of the initial demand letter; and that interest will be waived on the debt, or any portion thereof, which is paid within 30 days from the date of the initial demand notification letter;
(F) That administrative costs and penalties will be charged pursuant to 31 CFR 901.9;
(G) That collection by offset against current or subsequent claims or other amounts payable from the government may be taken;
(H) The opportunity to enter into a written agreement to repay the debt;
(I) The name, address, and phone number of a contact person or office that the debtor may contact regarding the debt.
(iii) A minimum of one demand letter is required. However, the specific content, timing and number of demand letters may be tailored to the type and amount of the debt, and the debtor's response, if any. Contractors' demand letters must be mailed or hand-delivered on the same date they are dated.
(iv) The initial or subsequent demand letters may also inform the debtor of the requirement to report delinquent debts to credit reporting agencies and to collection agencies, the requirement to refer debts to the Treasury Offset Program for offset from Federal income tax refunds and other amounts payable by the Government, offset from state payments, the requirement to refer debts to Treasury for collection and TRICARE policies concerning the referral of delinquent debts to the Department of Justice for enforced collection action. The initial or subsequent demand letter may also inform the debtor of TRICARE policies concerning waiver. When necessary to protect the Government's interest (for example to prevent the running of a statute of limitations), written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under this regulation, including referral to the Department of Justice for litigation. There should be no undue delay in responding to any communication received from the debtor. Responses to communications from debtors should be made within 30 days of receipt whenever feasible. If prior to the initiation of the demand process or at any time during or after completion of the demand process, the Director, TMA, or a designee, determines to pursue or is required to pursue offset, the
procedures applicable to administrative offset, found at paragraph (f)(6)(v) of this section, must be followed. If it appears that initial collection efforts are not productive or if immediate legal action on the claim appears necessary, the claim shall be referred promptly by the contractor to the Office of General Counsel, TMA.
(v)
Collection by administrative offset.
Collections by offset will be undertaken administratively in every instance when feasible. Collections may be taken by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716, the common law or other applicable statutory authority. No collection by offset may be undertaken unless the debtor has been sent a written demand for payment, including the procedural safeguards described in paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section, unless the failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt, and the time before payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the time for sending written notice. Such prior offset must be promptly followed by sending a written notice and affording the debtor the opportunity for a review by the TRICARE contractor. Examples of erroneous payments include, but are not limited to, claims submitted by individuals ineligible for TRICARE benefits, claims submitted for non-covered services or supplies, claims for which payments by another insurance or health plan reduce TRICARE liability, and from claims made from participating providers in which payment was initially erroneously made to the beneficiary. The resolution of recoupment claims rarely involves issues of credibility or veracity and a review of the written record is ordinarily an adequate means to correct prior mistakes. For this reason, the pre-offset oral hearing requirements of the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR 901.3(e) do not apply to the recoupment of erroneous TRICARE payments. However, in instances where an oral hearing is not required, the debtor will be afforded an administrative review if the TRICARE contractor receives a written request for an administrative review within 90 days from the date of the initial demand letter. The appeals procedures described in § 199.10 of this part, afford a TRICARE beneficiary or participating provider an opportunity for an administrative appellate review, including under certain circumstances, the right to an oral hearing before a hearing officer when an appealable issue exists. TRICARE contractors may take administrative action to offset erroneous payments against other current TRICARE payments owing a debtor. Payments on the claims of a debtor pending at or filed subsequent to the time collection action is initiated should be suspended pending the outcome of the collection action so that these funds will be available for offset. All or part of a debt may be offset depending on the amount available for offset. Any requests for offset received from other agencies and garnishment orders issued by courts of competent jurisdiction will be forwarded to the Office of General Counsel, TMA. Unless otherwise provided by law, administrative offset of payments under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3716 may not be conducted more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the TRICARE official or officials charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts. This limitation does not apply to debts reduced to judgment. This section does not apply to debts arising under the Social Security Act, except as provided in 42 U.S.C. 404, payments made under the Social Security Act, except as provided for in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c), debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code, except for offset of tax refunds or tariff laws of the United States; offsets against Federal salaries to the extent these standards are inconsistent with regulations published to implement such offsets under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716; offsets under 31 U.S.C. 3728 against a judgment obtained by a debtor against the United States; offset or recoupment under common law, state law, or federal statutes specifically prohibiting offset or recoupment of particular types of debts or offsets in the course
of judicial proceedings, including bankruptcy.
(A)
Referral for centralized administrative offset.
When cost-effective, legally enforceable non-tax debts delinquent over 180 days that are eligible for collection through administrative offset shall be referred to Treasury for administrative offset, unless otherwise exempted from referral. Referrals shall include certification that the debt is past due and legally enforceable and that TMA has complied with all due process requirements of the statute-authorizing offset. Administrative offset, including administrative offset against tax refunds due debtors under 26 U.S.C. 6402, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3720A, shall be effected through referral for centralized administrative offset, after debtors have been afforded at least sixty (60) days notice required in paragraph (f)(6) of this section. Salary offsets shall be effected through referral for centralized administrative offset, after debtors have been afforded due process required by 5 U.S.C. 5514, in accordance with 31 CFR 285.7. Referrals for salary offset shall include certification that the debts are past due, legally enforceable debts and that TMA has complied with all due process requirements under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and applicable agency regulations. The Treasury, Financial Management Service (FMS) may waive the salary offset certification requirement set forth in 31 CFR 285.7, as a prerequisite to submitting the debt to FMS for offset from other payment types. If FMS waives the certification requirement, before an offset occurs, TMA will provide the employee with the notice and opportunity for a hearing as required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and applicable regulations, and will certify to FMS that the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and applicable agency regulations have been met. TMA is not required to duplicate notice and administrative review or salary offset hearing opportunities before referring debts for centralized administrative offset when the debtor has been previously given them.
(B)
Referral for non-centralized administrative offset.
Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized administrative offset is not available or appropriate, past due legally enforceable non-tax-delinquent debts that are eligible for referral may be collected through non-centralized administrative offset through a request directly to the payment-authorizing agency. Referrals shall include certification that the debts are past due and that the agency has complied with due process requirements under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) or other applicable authority and applicable agency regulations concerning administrative offset. Generally, non-centralized administrative offsets will be made on an
ad hoc
case-by-case basis, in cooperation with the agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor.
(vi)
Collection by transfer of debts to Treasury or a Treasury-designated debt collection center for collection through cross servicing.
(A) The Director, TMA or a designee, is required to transfer legally enforceable non-tax debts that are delinquent 180 days or more to Treasury for collection through cross-servicing (31 U.S.C. 3711(g); 31 CFR 285.12.) Debts referred or transferred to Treasury or Treasury-designated debt collection centers shall be serviced, collected, or compromised, or the collection action will be suspended or terminated, in accordance with the statutory requirements and authorities applicable to the collection of such debts. Agencies operating Treasury-designated debt collection centers are authorized to charge a fee for services rendered regarding referred or transferred debts. This fee may be paid out of amounts collected and may be added to the debt as an administrative cost. Referrals will include certification that the debts transferred are valid, legally enforceable debts, that there are no legal bars to collection and that the agency has complied with all prerequisites to a particular collection action under the applicable laws, regulations or policies, unless the agency and Treasury agree that Treasury will do so on behalf of the agency.
(B) The requirement of paragraph (f)(1) of this section does not apply to any debt that:
(
1
) Is in litigation or foreclosure.
(
2
) Will be disposed of under an approved asset sale program.
(
3
) Has been referred to a private collection contractor for a period of time acceptable to Treasury.
(
4
) Will be collected under internal offset procedures within 3 years after the debt first became delinquent.
(
5
) Is exempt from this requirement based on a determination by the Secretary of the Treasury that exemption for a certain class of debt is in the best interest of the United States.
(vii)
Collection by salary offset.
When a debtor is a member of the military service or a retired member and collection by offset against other TRICARE payments due the debtor cannot be accomplished, and there have been no positive responses to a demand for payment, the Director, TMA, or a designee, may refer the debt for offset from the debtor's pay account pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 1007(c), as implemented by Volume 7A, Chapter 50 and Volume 7B, Chapter 28 of the DoDFMR. Collection from a Federal employee may be effected through salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514.
(A) For collections by salary offset the Director, TMA, or designee, will issue written notification, as required by 5 CFR 550.1104(d) at least 30 days before any offsets are taken. In addition, the notification will advise the employee that if he or she retires, resigns or his or her employment ends before collection of the debt is completed, collection may be made from subsequent payments of any nature due from the United States (e.g., final salary payment, lump-sum leave under 31 U.S.C. 3716 due the employee as of date of separation.) A debtor's involuntary payment of all or part of a debt being collected will not be construed as a waiver of any rights the debtor may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other provision of contract or law, unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary or the employee's paying agency is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund amounts deducted from his or her current pay. No interest will be paid on amounts waived or determined not to be owed unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary.
(B)
Petition for hearing.
The notice of the proposed offset will advise the debtor of his or her right to petition for a hearing. The petition for hearing must be signed by the debtor or his or her representative and must state whether he or she is contesting debt validity, debt amount and/or the terms of the proposed offset schedule. It must explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence and witnesses, if any (in the case of an oral hearing and a summary of their anticipated testimony), which the debtor believes support his or her position, and include any supporting documentation. If contesting the terms of the proposed offset schedule, the debtor must provide financial information including a completed Department of Justice Financial Statement of Debtor form (OBD-500 or other form prescribed by DOJ), including specific details concerning income and expenses of the employee, his or her spouse and dependents for 1-year period preceding the debt notification and projected income and expenses for the proposed offset period and a statement of the reason why the debtor believes the salary offset schedule will impose extreme financial hardship. Upon receipt of the petition for hearing, the Director, TMA, or a designee, will complete reconsideration. If the Director, TMA, or a designee determines that the debt amount is not owed, that a less amount is owed, or that the terms of the employee's proposed offset schedule are acceptable, it will advise the debtor and request that the employee accept the results of the reconsideration in lieu of a hearing. If the employee declines to accept the results of reconsideration in lieu of a hearing, the debtor will be afforded a hearing. Ordinarily, a petition for hearing and required submissions that are not timely filed, shall be accepted after expiration of the deadline provided in the notice of the proposed offset, only when the debtor can demonstrate to the Director, TMA, or a designee, that the timely filing of the request was not feasible due to extraordinary circumstances over which the appealing party had no practical control or because of failure to receive notice of the time limit (unless he or she was otherwise aware of it). Each request for an exception to the timely filing requirement will be considered on its own merits. The decision of the Director,
TMA, or a designee, on a request for an exception to the timely filing requirement shall be final.
(C)
Extreme financial hardship.
The maximum authorized amount that may be collected through involuntary salary offset is the lesser of 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay or the full amount of the debt. An employee who has petitioned for a hearing may assert that the maximum allowable rate of involuntary offset produces extreme financial hardship. An offset produces an extreme financial hardship if the offset prevents the employee from meeting the costs necessarily incurred for the essential expenses of the employee, employee's spouse and dependents. These essential expenses include costs incurred for food, housing, necessary public utilities, clothing, transportation and medical care. In determining whether the offset would prevent the employee from meeting the essential expenses identified above, the following shall be considered:
(
1
) Income from all sources of the employee, the employee's spouse, and dependents;
(
2
) The extent to which assets of the employee, employee's spouse and dependents are available to meet the offset and essential subsistence expenses;
(
3
) Whether these essential subsistence expenses have been minimized to the greatest extent possible;
(
4
) The extent to which the employee or the employee's spouse can borrow money to meet the offset and other essential expenses; and
(
5
) The extent to which the employee and the employee's spouse and dependents have other exceptional expenses that should be taken into account and whether these expenses have been minimized.
(D)
Form and content of hearings.
The resolution of recoupment claims rarely involves issues of credibility or veracity and a review of the written record is ordinarily an adequate means to determine the validity or amount of the debt and/or the terms of a proposed offset schedule. The Director, TMA, or a designee, will determine whether an oral hearing is required. A debtor who has petitioned for a hearing, but who is not entitled to an oral hearing will be given an administrative hearing, based on the written documentation submitted by the debtor and the Director, TMA, or a designee. If the Director, TMA, or a designee, determines that the debtor should be afforded the opportunity for an oral hearing, the debtor may elect to have a hearing based on the written record in lieu of an oral hearing. The Director, TMA, or a designee, will provide the debtor (or his representative) notification of the time, date and location of the oral hearing to be held if the debtor has been afforded an oral hearing. Copies of records documenting the debt will be provided to the debtor or his representative (if they have not been previously provided), at least 3 calendar days prior to the date of the oral hearing. At oral hearings, the only evidence permitted, except oral testimony, will be that which was previously submitted as pre-hearing submissions. At oral hearings, the debtor may not raise any issues not previously raised with TMA. In the absence of good cause shown, a debtor who fails to appear at an oral hearing will be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and salary offset may be initiated.
(E)
Costs for attendance at oral hearings.
Debtors and their witnesses will bear their own costs for attendance at oral hearings.
(F)
Hearing official's decision.
The Hearing Official's decision will be in writing and will identify the documentation reviewed. It will indicate the amount of debt that he or she determined is valid and shall state the amount of the offset and the estimated duration of the offset. The determination of a hearing official designated under this section is considered an official certification regarding the existence and amount of the debt and/or the terms of the proposed offset schedule for the purposes of executing salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514. The Hearing Official's decision must be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days from the date the petition for hearing is received by the Office of General Counsel, TMA, unless the debtor requests, and the Hearing
Official grants a delay in the proceedings. If a hearing official determines that the debt may not be collected by salary offset, but the Director, TMA, or a designee, finds the debt is still valid, the Director, TMA or a designee, may seek collection through other means, including but not limited to, offset from other payments due from the United States.
(viii) [Reserved]
(ix)
Collection of installments.
Debts, including interest, penalty and administrative costs shall be collected in one lump sum whenever possible. However, when the debtor is financially unable to pay the debt in one lump sum, the TRICARE contractor or the Director, TMA, or designee, may accept payment in installments. Debtors claiming that lump sum payment will create financial hardship may be required to complete a Department of Justice Financial Statement of Debtor form or provide other financial information that will permit TMA to verify such representations. TMA may also obtain credit reports to assess installment requests. Normally, debtors will make installment payments on a monthly basis. Installment payment shall bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. Except when a debtor can demonstrate financial hardship or another reasonable cause exists, installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in 3 years or less. (31 CFR 901.8(b)). Normally, installment payments of $75 or less will not be accepted unless the debtor demonstrates financial hardship. Any installment agreement with a debtor in which the total amount of deferred installments will exceed $750, should normally include an executed promissory agreement. Copies of installment agreements will be retained in the contractor's or TMA, Office of General Counsel's files.
(x)
Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.
Title 31 U.S.C. 3717 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR 901.9, require the assessment of interest, penalty and administrative costs on delinquent debts. Interest shall accrue from the date the initial debt notification is mailed to the debtor. The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the United States Treasury (the Treasury tax and loan account rate). The collection of interest on the debt or any portion of the debt, which is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest begins to accrue, shall be waived. The Director, TMA, or designee, may extend this 30-day period on a case-by-case basis, if it reasonably determines that such action is appropriate. The rate of interest as initially assessed shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness; except that where the debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, a new interest rate may be set which reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury at the time the new agreement is executed. Interest shall not be compounded; that is, interest shall not be charged on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section. However, if a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, charges that accrued but were not collected under the defaulted agreement, shall be added to the principal under the new repayment agreement. The collection of interest, penalties and administrative costs may be waived in whole or in part as a part of the compromise of a debt as provided in paragraph (g) of this section. In addition, the Director, TMA, or designee may waive in whole or in part, the collection of interest, penalties, or administrative costs assessed herein if he or she determines that collection would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interest of the United States. Some situations in which a waiver may be appropriate include:
(A) Waiver of interest consistent with 31 CFR 903.2(c)(2) in connection with a suspension of collection when a TRICARE appeal is pending under § 199.10 of this part where there is a substantial issue of fact in dispute.
(B) Waiver of interest where the original debt arose through no fault or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor and the collection of interest would impose a financial hardship or burden on the debtor. Some examples in which such a waiver would be appropriate include: A debt arising when a
TRICARE beneficiary in good faith files and is paid for a claim for medical services or supplies, which are later determined not to be covered benefits, or a debt arising when a TRICARE beneficiary is overpaid as the result of a calculation error on the part of the TRICARE contractor or TMA.
(C) Waiver of interest where there has been an agreement to repay a debt in installments, there is no indication of fault or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor, and the amount of interest is so large in relation to the size of the installments that the debtor can reasonably afford to pay, that it is likely the debt will never be repaid in full. When a debt is paid in installments, the installment payments first will be applied to the payment of outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second, to accrued interest and then to principal. Administrative costs incurred as the result of a debt becoming delinquent (as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section) shall be assessed against a debtor. These administrative costs represent the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent. The calculation of administrative costs should be based upon cost analysis establishing an average of actual additional costs incurred in processing and handling claims against other debtors in similar stages of delinquency. A penalty charge, not exceeding six percent a year, shall be assessed on the amount due on a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge, which need not be calculated until the 91st day of delinquency, shall accrue from the date that the debt became delinquent.
(xi)
Referral to private collection agencies.
TMA shall use government-wide debt collection contracts to obtain debt collection services provided by private contractors in accordance with 31 CFR 901.5(b).
(xii)
Reporting delinquent debts to credit reporting agencies.
Delinquent consumer debts shall be reported to credit reporting agencies. Delinquent debts are debts which are not paid or for which satisfactory payment arrangements are not made by the due date specified in the initial debt notification letter, or those for which the debtor has entered into a written payment agreement and installment payments are past due 30 days or longer. Such referrals shall comply with the Bankruptcy Code and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended. The provisions of the Privacy Act do not apply to credit bureaus (31 CFR 901.4(1)). There is no requirement to duplicate the notice and review opportunities before referring debts to credit bureaus. Debtors will be advised of the specific information to be transmitted (i.e., name, address, and taxpayer identification number, information about the debt). Procedures developed for such referrals must ensure that an accounting of the disclosures shall be kept which is available to the debtor; that the credit reporting agencies are provided with corrections and annotations of disagreements of the debtor; and that reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the information to be reported is accurate, complete, timely and relevant. When requested by a credit-reporting agency, verification of the information disclosed will be provided promptly. Once a claim has been reviewed and determined to be valid, a complete explanation of the claim will be given the debtor. When the claim is overdue, the individual will be notified in writing that payment is overdue; that within not less than 60 days, disclosure of the claim shall be made to a consumer reporting agency unless satisfactory payment arrangements are made, or unless the debtor requests an administrative review and demonstrates some basis on which the debt is legitimately disputed; and of the specific information to be disclosed to the consumer reporting agency. The information to be disclosed to the credit reporting agency will be limited to information necessary to establish the identity of the debtor, including name, address and taxpayer identification number; the amount, status and history of the claim; and the agency or program under which the claim arose. Reasonable action will be taken to locate an individual for whom a current address is not available. The requirements of this section do not apply to commercial debts, although commercial debts shall be reported to commercial credit
bureaus. Treasury will report debts transferred to it for collection to credit reporting agencies on behalf of the Director, TMA, or a designee.
(xiii)
Use and disclosure of mailing addresses.
In attempting to locate a debtor in order to collect or compromise a debt under this section, the Director, TMA, or a designee, may send a written request to the Secretary of the Treasury, or a designee, for current address information from records of the Internal Revenue Service. TMA may disclose mailing addresses obtained under this authority to other agencies and to collection agencies for collection purposes.
(g)
Compromise, suspension or termination of collection actions arising under the Federal Claims Collection Act
—(1)
Basic considerations.
Federal claims against the debtor and in favor of the United States arising out of the administration of TRICARE may be compromised or collection action taken thereon may be suspended or terminated in compliance with the Federal Claims Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3711, as implemented by the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR parts 900-904. The provisions concerning compromise, suspension or termination of collection activity pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711 apply to debts, which do not exceed $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if any. If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, exclusive of interest, penalties and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with the DOJ.
(2)
Authority.
TRICARE contractors are not authorized to compromise or to suspend or terminate collection action on TRICARE claims. Only the Director, TMA, or designee or Uniformed Services claims officers acting under the provisions of their own regulations are so authorized.
(3)
Basis for compromise.
A compromise should be for an amount that bears a reasonable relation to the amount that can be recovered by enforced collection procedures, with regard to the exemptions available to the debtor and the time collection will take. A claim may be compromised hereunder if the government cannot collect the full amount if:
(i) The debtor or the estate of a debtor does not have the present or prospective ability to pay the full amount within a reasonable time;
(ii) The cost of collecting the claim does not justify enforced collection of the full amount; or
(iii) The government is unable to enforce collection of the full amount within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings; or
(iv) There is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed; or
(v) The cost of collecting the claim does not justify enforced collection of the full amount.
(4)
Basis for suspension.
Collection action may be suspended for the following reasons if future collection action may be sufficiently productive to justify periodic review and action on the claim, considering its size and the amount, which may be realized thereon:
(i) The debtor cannot be located; or
(ii) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or
(iii) The debtor is unable to make payments on the government's claim or effect a compromise at the time, but the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the claim for periodic review and action and;
(A) The applicable statute of limitations has been tolled or started running anew; or
(B) Future collections can be effected by administrative offset, notwithstanding the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for litigation of claims with due regard to the 10-year limitation for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(e)(1); or
(C) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on which collection action will be temporarily suspended and such temporary suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability fully to pay the principal
amount of the debt with interest at a later date.
(iv) Consideration may be given by the Director, TMA, or designee to suspend collection action pending action on a request for a review of the government's claim against the debtor or pending an administrative review under § 199.10 of this part of any TRICARE claim or claims directly involved in the government's claim against the debtor. Suspension under this paragraph will be made on a case-by-case basis as to whether:
(A) There is a reasonable possibility that the debt (in whole or in part) will be found not owing from the debtor;
(B) The government's interest would be protected if suspension were granted by reasonable assurance that the debt would be recovered if the debtor does not prevail; and
(C) Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship.
(5) Collection action may be terminated for one or more of the following reasons:
(i) TMA cannot collect or enforce collection of any substantial amount through its own efforts or the efforts of others, including consideration of the judicial remedies available to the government, the debtor's future financial prospects, and the exemptions available to the debtor under state and federal law;
(ii) The debtor cannot be located, and either;
(iii) The costs of collection are anticipated to exceed the amount recoverable; or
(iv) It is determined that the debt is legally without merit or enforcement of the debt is barred by any applicable statute of limitations; or
(v) The debt cannot be substantiated; or
(vi) The debt against the debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy. Collection activity may be continued subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, such as collection of any payments provided under a plan of reorganization or in cases when TMA did not receive notice of the bankruptcy proceedings.
(6) In determining whether the debt should be compromised, suspended or terminated, the responsible TMA collection authority will consider the following factors:
(i) Age and health of the debtor; present and potential income; inheritance prospects; the possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor; and the availability of assets or income which may be realized by enforced collection proceedings;
(ii) Applicability of exemptions available to a debtor under state or federal law;
(iii) Uncertainty as to the price which collateral or other property may bring at a forced sale;
(iv) The probability of proving the claim in court because of legal issues involved or because of a bona fide dispute of the facts; the probability of full or partial recovery; the availability of necessary evidence and related pragmatic considerations. Debtors may be required to provide a completed Department of Justice Financial Statement of Debtor form (OBD-500 or such other form that DOJ shall prescribe) or other financial information that will permit TMA to verify debtors' representations. TMA may obtain credit reports or other financial information to enable it independently to verify debtors' representations.
(7) Payment of compromised claims. (i)
Time and manner.
Compromised claims are to be paid in one lump sum whenever possible. However, if installment payments of a compromised claim are necessary, a legally enforceable compromise agreement must be obtained. Payment of the amount that TMA has agreed to accept as a compromise in full settlement of a TRICARE claim must be made within the time and in the manner prescribed in the compromise agreement. Any such compromised amount is not settled until full payment of the compromised amount has been made within the time and manner prescribed. Compromise agreements must provide for the reinstatement of the prior indebtedness, less sums paid thereon, and acceleration of the balance due upon default in the payment of any installment.
(ii)
Failure to pay the compromised amount.
Failure of any debtor to make
payment as provided in the compromise agreement will have the effect of reinstating the full amount of the original claim, less any amounts paid prior to default.
(iii) Effect of compromise, waiver, suspension or termination of collection action. Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6050P, compromises and terminations of undisputed debts totaling $600 or more for the year will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service in the manner prescribed. Amounts, other than those discharged in bankruptcy, will be included in the debtor's gross income for that year. Any action taken under paragraph (g) of this section regarding the compromise of a federal claim, or waiver or suspension or termination of collection action on a federal claim is not an initial determination for the purposes of the appeal procedures in § 199.10.
(h)
Referrals for collection
—(1)
Prompt referral.
Federal claims of $2,500, exclusive of interest, penalties and administrative costs, or such other amount as the Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe on which collection action has been taken under the provisions of this section which cannot be collected or compromised or on which collection action cannot be suspended or terminated as provided herein, will be promptly referred to the Department of Justice for litigation in accordance with 31 CFR part 904. Such referrals shall be made as early as possible consistent with aggressive collection action made by TRICARE contractors and TMA. Referral will be made with sufficient time to bring timely suit against the debtor. Referral shall be made by submission of a completed Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR), accompanied by a signed Certificate of Indebtedness. Claims of less than the minimum amount shall not be referred unless litigation to collect such smaller claims is important to ensure compliance with TRICARE's policies or programs; the claim is being referred solely for the purpose of securing a judgment against the debtor, which will be filed as a lien against the debtor's property pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 3201 and returned to the referring office for enforcement; or the debtor has the clear ability to pay the claim and the Government effectively can enforce payment, with due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under state and Federal law and judicial remedies available to the Government.
(2)
Preservation of evidence.
The Director, TMA, or a designee will take such action as is necessary to ensure that all files, records and exhibits on claims referred, hereunder, are properly preserved.
(i)
Claims involving indication of fraud, filing of false claims or misrepresentation.
Any case in which there is an indication of fraud, the filing of a false claim or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim, shall be promptly referred to the Director, TMA, or designee. The Director, TMA, or a designee, will investigate and evaluate the case and either refer the case to an appropriate investigative law enforcement agency or return the claim for other appropriate administrative action, including collection action under this section. Payment on all TRICARE beneficiary or provider claims in which fraud, filing false claims or misrepresentation is suspected will be suspended until the Director, TMA, or designee, authorizes payment or denial of the claims. Collection action on all claims in which a suspicion of fraud, misrepresentation or filing false claims arises, will be suspended pending referral to the appropriate law enforcement agencies by the Director, TMA, or a designee. Only the Department of Justice has authority to compromise, suspend or terminate collection of such debts.

[73 FR 71547, Nov. 25, 2008, as amended at 77 FR 38176, June 27, 2012; 82 FR 45447, Sept. 29, 2017]
§ 199.12
Third party recoveries.
(a)
General.
This section deals with the right of the United States to recover from third-parties the costs of medical care furnished to or paid on behalf of TRICARE beneficiaries. These third-parties may be individuals or entities that are liable for tort damages to the injured TRICARE beneficiary or a liability insurance carrier covering the individual or entity. These third-parties may also include other entities
who are primarily responsible to pay for the medical care provided to the injured beneficiary by reason of an insurance policy, workers' compensation program or other source of primary payment.
Authority
—(1)
Third-party payers.
This part implements the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1095b which, in general, allow the Secretary of Defense to authorize certain TRICARE claims to be paid, even though a third-party payer may be primary payer, with authority to collect from the third-party payer the TRICARE costs incurred on behalf of the beneficiary. (See § 199.2 for definition of “third-party payer.”) Therefore, 10 U.S.C. 1095b establishes the statutory obligation of third-party payers to reimburse the United States the costs incurred on behalf of TRICARE beneficiaries who are also covered by the third-party payer's plan.
(2)
Federal Medical Care Recovery Act
—(i)
In general.
In many cases covered by this section, the United States has a right to collect under both 10 U.S.C. 1095b and the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (FMCRA), Public Law 87-693 (42 U.S.C. 2651
et. seq.
). In such cases, the authority is concurrent and the United States may pursue collection under both statutory authorities.
(ii)
Cases involving tort liability.
In cases in which the right of the United States to collect from an automobile liability insurance carrier is premised on establishing some tort liability on some third person, matters regarding the determination of such tort liability shall be governed by the same substantive standards as would be applied under the FMCRA including reliance on state law for determinations regarding tort liability. In addition, the provisions of 28 CFR part 43 (Department of Justice regulations pertaining to the FMCRA) shall apply to claims made under the concurrent authority of the FMCRA and 10 U.S.C. 1095b. All other matters and procedures concerning the right of the United States to collect shall, if a claim is made under the concurrent authority of the FMCRA and this section, be governed by 10 U.S.C. 1095b and this part.
(c)
Appealability.
This section describes the procedures to be followed in the assertion and collection of third-party recovery claims in favor of the United States arising from the operation of TRICARE. Actions taken under this section are not initial determinations for the purpose of the appeal procedures of § 199.10 of this part. However, the proper exercise of the right to appeal benefit or provider status determinations under the procedures set forth in § 199.10 may affect the processing of federal claims arising under this section. Those appeal procedures afford a TRICARE beneficiary or participating provider an opportunity for administrative appellate review in cases in which benefits have been denied and in which there is a significant factual dispute. For example, a TRICARE contractor may deny payment for services that are determined to be excluded as TRICARE benefits because they are found to be not medically necessary. In that event the TRICARE contractor will offer an administrative appeal as provided in § 199.10 of this part on the medical necessity issue raised by the adverse benefit determination. If the care in question results from an accidental injury and if the appeal results in a reversal of the initial determination to deny the benefit, a third-party recovery claim may arise as a result of the appeal decision to pay the benefit. However, in no case is the decision to initiate such a claim itself appealable under § 199.10.
(d)
Statutory obligation of third-party payer to pay
—(1)
Basic Rule.
Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095b, when the Secretary of Defense authorizes certain TRICARE claims to be paid, even though a third-party payer may be primary payer (as specified under § 199.8(c)(2)), the right to collect from a third-party payer the TRICARE costs incurred on behalf of the beneficiary is the same as exists for the United States to collect from third-party payers the cost of care provided by a facility of the uniformed services under 10 U.S.C. 1095 and part 220 of this title. Therefore the obligation of a third-party payer to pay is to the same extent that the beneficiary would be eligible to receive reimbursement or indemnification from the third-party payer if the beneficiary were to incur
the costs on the beneficiary's own behalf.
(2)
Application of cost shares.
If the third-party payer's plan includes a requirement for a deductible or copayment by the beneficiary of the plan, then the amount the United States may collect from the third-party payer is the cost of care incurred on behalf of the beneficiary less the appropriate deductible or copayment amount.
(3)
Claim from the United States exclusive.
The only way for a third-party payer to satisfy its obligation under 10 U.S.C. 1095b is to pay the United States or authorized representative of the United States. Payment by a third-party payer to the beneficiary does not satisfy 10 U.S.C. 1095b.
(4)
Assignment of benefits not necessary.
The obligation of the third-party to pay is not dependent upon the beneficiary executing an assignment of benefits to the United States.
(e)
Exclusions impermissible
—(1)
Statutory requirement.
With the same right to collect from third-party payers as exists under 10 U.S.C. 1095(b), no provision of any third-party payer's plan having the effect of excluding from coverage or limiting payment for certain care if that care is provided or paid by the United States shall operate to prevent collection by the United States.
(2)
Regulatory application.
No provision of any third-party payer's plan or program purporting to have the effect of excluding or limiting payment for certain care that would not be given such effect under the standards established in part 220 of this title to implement 10 U.S.C. 1095 shall operate to exclude or limit payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095b or this section.
(f)
Records available.
When requested, TRICARE contractors or other representatives of the United States shall make available to representatives of any third-party payer from which the United States seeks payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095b, for inspection and review, appropriate health care records (or copies of such records) of individuals for whose care payment is sought. Appropriate records which will be made available are records which document that the TRICARE costs incurred on behalf of beneficiaries which are the subject of the claims for payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095b were incurred as claimed and the health care service were provided in a manner consistent with permissible terms and conditions of the third-party payer's plan. This is the sole purpose for which patient care records will be made available. Records not needed for this purpose will not be made available.
(g)
Remedies.
Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095b, when the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, authorizes certain TRICARE claims to be paid, even though a third-party payer may be primary payer, the right to collect from a third-party payer the TRICARE costs incurred on behalf of the beneficiary is the same as exists for the United States to collect from third-party payers the cost of care provided by a facility of the uniformed services under 10 U.S.C. 1095.
(1) This includes the authority under 10 U.S.C. 1095(e)(1) for the United States to institute and prosecute legal proceedings against a third-party payer to enforce a right of the United States under 10 U.S.C. 1095b and this section.
(2) This also includes the authority under 10 U.S.C. 1095(e)(2) for an authorized representative of the United States to compromise, settle or waive a claim of the United States under 10 U.S.C. 1095b and this section.
(3) The authorities provided by the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3701
et. seq.
) and any implementing regulations (including § 199.11) regarding collection of indebtedness due the United States shall also be available to effect collections pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095b and this section.
(h)
Obligations of beneficiaries.
To insure the expeditious and efficient processing of third-party payer claims, any person furnished care and treatment under TRICARE, his or her guardian, personal representative, counsel, estate, dependents or survivors shall be required:
(1) To provide information regarding coverage by a third-party payer plan and/or the circumstances surrounding an injury to the patient as a conditional precedent of the processing of a TRICARE claim involving possible third-party payer coverage.
(2) To furnish such additional information as may be requested concerning the circumstances giving rise to the injury or disease for which care and treatment are being given and concerning any action instituted or to be instituted by or against a third person; and,
(3) To cooperate in the prosecution of all claims and actions by the United States against such third person.
(i)
Responsibility for recovery.
The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, is responsible for insuring that TRICARE claims arising under 10 U.S.C. 1095b and this section (including claims involving the FMCRA) are properly referred to and coordinated with designated claims authorities of the uniformed services who shall assert and recover TRICARE costs incurred on behalf of beneficiaries. Generally, claims arising under this section will be processed as follows:
(1)
Identification and referral.
