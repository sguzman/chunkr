# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 203.0
What definitions apply to this part?
Authorized field
means a field:
(1) Located in a water depth of at least 200 meters and in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude;
(2) That includes one or more pre-Act leases; and
(3) From which no current pre-Act lease produced, other than test production, before November 28, 1995.
Certified unsuccessful well
means an original well or a sidetrack with a sidetrack measured depth (
i.e.,
length) of at least 10,000 feet, on your lease that:
(1) You begin drilling on or after March 26, 2003, and before May 3, 2009, on a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep and that is not a non-converted lease, or on or after May 18, 2007, and before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep;
(2) You begin drilling before your lease produces gas or oil from a well with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 18,000 feet true vertical depth subsea (TVD SS), (
i.e.,
below the datum at mean sea level);
(3) You drill to at least 18,000 feet TVD SS with a target reservoir on your lease, identified from seismic and related data, deeper than that depth;
(4) Fails to meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 550, subpart A, and does not produce gas or oil, or meets those producibility requirements and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) agrees it is not commercially producible; and
(5) For which you have provided the notices and information required under § 203.47.
Complete application
means an original and two copies of the six reports consisting of the data specified in §§ 203.81, 203.83, and 203.85 through 203.89, along with one set of digital information, which Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) has reviewed and found complete.
Deep well
means either an original well or a sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 15,000 feet TVD SS and less than 20,000 feet TVD SS. A deep well subsequently re-perforated at less than 15,000 feet TVD SS in the same reservoir is still a deep well.
Determination
means the binding decision by BSEE on whether your field qualifies for relief or how large a royalty-suspension volume must be to make the field economically viable.
Development project
means a project to develop one or more oil or gas reservoirs located on one or more contiguous leases that have had no production (other than test production) before the current application for royalty relief and are either:
(1) Located in a planning area offshore Alaska; or
(2) Located in the GOM in a water depth of at least 200 meters and wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude, and were issued in a sale held after November 28, 2000.
Draft application
means the preliminary set of information and assumptions you submit to seek a nonbinding assessment on whether a field could be expected to qualify for royalty relief.
Eligible lease
means a lease that:
(1) Is issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after November 28, 1995, and before November 28, 2000;
(2) Is located in the Gulf of Mexico in water depths of 200 meters or deeper;
(3) Lies wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; and
(4) Is offered subject to a royalty suspension volume.
Expansion project
means a project that meets the following requirements:
(1) You must propose the project in a (BOEM) Development and Production Plan, a BOEM Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD), or a BOEM Supplement to a DOCD, approved by the Secretary of the Interior after November 28, 1995.
(2) The project must be located on either:
(i) A pre-Act lease in the GOM, or a lease in the GOM issued in a sale held after November 28, 2000, located wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; or
(ii) A lease in a planning area offshore Alaska.
(3) On a pre-Act lease in the GOM, the project:
(i) Must significantly increase the ultimate recovery of resources from one or more reservoirs that have not previously produced (extending recovery from reservoirs already in production does not constitute a significant increase); and
(ii) Must involve a substantial capital investment (e.g., fixed-leg platform, subsea template and manifold, tension-leg platform, multiple well project,
etc.
).
(4) For a lease issued in a planning area offshore Alaska, or in the GOM after November 28, 2000, the project must involve a new well drilled into a reservoir that has not previously produced.
(5) On a lease in the GOM, the project must not include a reservoir the production from which an RSV under §§ 203.30 through 203.36 or §§ 203.40 through 203.48 would be applied.
Fabrication (or start of construction)
means evidence of an irreversible commitment to a concept and scale of development. Evidence includes copies of a binding contract between you (as applicant) and a fabrication yard, a letter from a fabricator certifying that continuous construction has begun, and a receipt for the customary down payment.
Field
means an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same general geological structural feature or stratigraphic trapping condition. Two or more reservoirs may be in a field, separated vertically by intervening impervious strata or laterally by local geologic barriers, or both.
Lease
means a lease or unit.
New production
means any production from a current pre-Act lease from which no royalties are due on production, other than test production, before November 28, 1995. Also, it means any
additional production resulting from new lease-development activities on a lease issued in a sale after November 28, 2000, or a current pre-Act lease under a BOEM DOCD or a BOEM Supplement approved by the Secretary of the Interior after November 28, 1995.
Nonbinding assessment
means an opinion by BSEE of whether your field could qualify for royalty relief. It is based on your draft application and does not entitle the field to relief.
Non-converted lease
means a lease located partly or entirely in water less than 200 meters deep issued in a lease sale held after January 1, 2001, and before January 1, 2004, whose original lease terms provided for an RSV for deep gas production and the lessee has not exercised the option under § 203.49 to replace the lease terms for royalty relief with those in § 203.0 and §§ 203.40 through 203.48.
Original well
means a well that is drilled without utilizing an existing wellbore. An original well includes all sidetracks drilled from the original wellbore either before the drilling rig moves off the well location or after a temporary rig move that BSEE agrees was forced by a weather or safety threat and drilling resumes within 1 year. A bypass from an original well (e.g., drilling around material blocking the hole or to straighten crooked holes) is part of the original well.
Participating area
means that part of the unit area that BSEE determines is reasonably proven by drilling and completion of producible wells, geological and geophysical information, and engineering data to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in paying quantities.
Performance conditions
mean minimum conditions you must meet, after we have granted relief and before production begins, to remain qualified for that relief. If you do not meet each one of these performance conditions, we consider it a change in material fact significant enough to invalidate our original evaluation and approval.
Phase 1 ultra-deep well
means an ultra-deep well on a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep for which drilling began before May 18, 2007, and that begins production before May 3, 2009, or that meets the requirements to be a certified unsuccessful well.
Phase 2 ultra-deep well
means an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 2007; and that either meets the requirements to be a certified unsuccessful well or that begins production:
(1) Before the date which is 5 years after the lease issuance date on a non-converted lease; or
(2) Before May 3, 2009, on all other leases located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep; or
(3) Before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep.
Phase 3 ultra-deep well
means an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 2007, and that begins production:
(1) On or after the date which is 5 years after the lease issuance date on a non-converted lease; or
(2) On or after May 3, 2009, on all other leases located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep; or
(3) On or after May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep.
Pre-Act lease
means a lease that:
(1) Results from a sale held before November 28, 1995;
(2) Is located in the GOM in water depths of 200 meters or deeper; and
(3) Lies wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude.
Production
means all oil, gas, and other relevant products you save, remove, or sell from a tract or those quantities allocated to your tract under a unitization formula, as measured for the purposes of determining the amount of royalty payable to the United States.
Project
means any activity that requires at least a permit to drill.
Qualified deep well
means:
(1) On a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep that is not a non-converted lease, a deep well for which drilling began on or after March 26, 2003, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with oil production, before May 3, 2009, and for
which you have met the requirements prescribed in § 203.44;
(2) On a non-converted lease, a deep well that produces natural gas (other than test production) before the date which is 5 years after the lease issuance date from a reservoir that has not produced from a deep well on any lease; or
(3) On a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters but entirely less than 400 meters deep, a deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 2007, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with oil production before May 3, 2013, and for which you have met the requirements prescribed in § 203.44.
Qualified ultra-deep well
means:
(1) On a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep that is not a non-converted lease, an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after March 26, 2003, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with oil production, and for which you have met the requirements prescribed in § 203.35 or § 203.44, as applicable; or
(2) On a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep, or on a non-converted lease, an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 2007, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with oil production, and for which you have met the requirements prescribed in § 203.35.
Qualified well
means either a qualified deep well or a qualified ultra-deep well.
Redetermination
means our reconsideration of our determination on royalty relief because you request it after:
(1) We have rejected your application;
(2) We have granted relief but you want a larger suspension volume;

(4) You renounce royalty relief.
Renounce
means action you take to give up relief after we have granted it and before you start production.
Reservoir
means an underground accumulation of oil or natural gas, or both, characterized by a single pressure system and segregated from other such accumulations.
Royalty suspension (RS) lease
means a lease that:
(1) Is issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after November 28, 2000;
(2) Is in locations or planning areas specified in a particular Notice of OCS Lease Sale offering that lease; and
(3) Is offered subject to a royalty suspension specified in a Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the
Federal Register.
Royalty suspension supplement (RSS)
means a royalty suspension volume resulting from drilling a certified unsuccessful well that is applied to future natural gas and oil production generated at any drilling depth on, or allocated under a BSEE-approved unit agreement to, the same lease.
Royalty suspension volume (RSV)
means a volume of production from a lease that is not subject to royalty under the provisions of this part.
Sidetrack
means, for the purpose of this subpart, a well resulting from drilling an additional hole to a new objective bottom-hole location by leaving a previously drilled hole. A sidetrack also includes drilling a well from a platform slot reclaimed from a previously drilled well or re-entering and deepening a previously drilled well. A bypass from a sidetrack (e.g., drilling around material blocking the hole, or to straighten crooked holes) is part of the sidetrack.
Sidetrack measured depth
means the actual distance or length in feet a sidetrack is drilled beginning where it exits a previously drilled hole to the bottom hole of the sidetrack, that is, to its total depth.
Sunk costs for an authorized field
means the after-tax eligible costs that you (not third parties) incur for exploration, development, and production from the spud date of the first discovery on the field to the date we receive your complete application for royalty relief. The discovery well must be qualified as producible under 30 CFR part 550, subpart A. Sunk costs include the rig mobilization and material costs for the discovery well that you incurred before its spud date.
Sunk costs for an expansion or development project
means the after-tax eligible costs that you (not third parties) incur for only the first well that encounters hydrocarbons in the reservoir(s) included in the application and that meets the producibility requirements under 30 CFR part 550, subpart A on each lease participating in the application. Sunk costs include rig mobilization and material costs for the discovery wells that you incurred before their spud dates.
Ultra-deep well
means either an original well or a sidetrack completed with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 20,000 feet TVD SS. An ultra-deep well subsequently re-perforated less than 20,000 feet TVD SS in the same reservoir is still an ultra-deep well.
Withdraw
means action we take on a field that has qualified for relief if you have not met one or more of the performance conditions.
§ 203.1
What is BSEE's authority to grant royalty relief?
The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1337, as amended by the OCS Deep Water Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA), Public Law 104-58 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Public Law 109-058 authorizes us to grant royalty relief in four situations.
(a) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(A), we may reduce or eliminate any royalty or a net profit share specified for an OCS lease to promote increased production.
(b) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(B), we may reduce, modify, or eliminate any royalty or net profit share to promote development, increase production, or encourage production of marginal resources on certain leases or categories of leases. This authority is restricted to leases in the GOM that are west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude, and in the planning areas offshore Alaska.
(c) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), we may suspend royalties for designated volumes of new production from any lease if:
(1) Your lease is in deep water (water at least 200 meters deep);
(2) Your lease is in designated areas of the GOM (west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude);
(3) Your lease was acquired in a lease sale held before the DWRRA (before November 28, 1995);
(4) We find that your new production would not be economic without royalty relief; and
(5) Your lease is on a field that did not produce before enactment of the DWRRA, or if you propose a project to significantly expand production under a Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) or a supplementary DOCD, that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) approved after November 28, 1995.
(d) Under 42 U.S.C. 15904-15905, we may suspend royalties for designated volumes of gas production from deep and ultra-deep wells on a lease if:
(1) Your lease is in shallow water (water less than 400 meters deep) and you produce from an ultra-deep well (top of the perforated interval is at least 20,000 feet TVD SS) or your lease is in waters entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep and you produce from a deep well (top of the perforated interval is at least 15,000 feet TVD SS);
(2) Your lease is in the designated area of the GOM (wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes west longitude); and
(3) Your lease is not eligible for deep water royalty relief.
§ 203.2
How can I obtain royalty relief?
We may reduce or suspend royalties for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases or projects that meet the criteria in the following table.
If you have a lease . . .
And if you . . .
Then we may grant you . . .
(a) With earnings that cannot sustain production (
i.e., End-of-life lease
),
Would abandon otherwise potentially recoverable resources but seek to increase production by operating beyond the point at which the lease is economic under the existing royalty rate,
A reduced royalty rate on current monthly production and a higher royalty rate on additional monthly production (see §§ 203.50 through 203.56).
(b) Located in a designated GOM deep water area (
i.e.,
200 meters or greater) and acquired in a lease sale held before November 28, 1995, or after November 28, 2000,
Propose an expansion project and can demonstrate your project is uneconomic without royalty relief,
A royalty suspension for a minimum production volume plus any additional production large enough to make the project economic (see §§ 203.60 through 203.79).
(c) Located in a designated GOM deep water area and acquired in a lease sale held before November 28, 1995
(Pre-Act lease),
Are on a field from which no current pre-Act lease produced (other than test production) before November 28, 1995,
(Authorized field,)
A royalty suspension for a minimum production volume plus any additional volume needed to make the field economic (see §§ 203.60 through 203.79).
(d) Located in a designated GOM deep water area and acquired in a lease sale held after November 28, 2000,
Propose a development project and can demonstrate that the suspension volume, if any, for your lease is not enough to make development economic,
A royalty suspension for a minimum production volume plus any additional volume needed to make your project economic (see §§ 203.60 through 203.79).
(e) Where royalty relief would recover significant additional resources or, offshore Alaska or in certain areas of the GOM, would enable development,
Are not eligible to apply for end-of-life or deep water royalty relief, but show us you meet certain eligibility conditions,
A royalty modification in size, duration, or form that makes your lease or project economic (see § 203.80).
(f) Located in a designated GOM shallow water area and acquired in a lease sale held before January 1, 2001, or after January 1, 2004, or have exercised an option to substitute for royalty relief in your lease terms,
Drill a deep well on a lease that is not eligible for deep water royalty relief and you have not previously produced oil or gas from a deep well or an ultra-deep well,
A royalty suspension for a volume of gas produced from successful deep and ultra-deep wells, or, for certain unsuccessful deep and ultra-deep wells, a smaller royalty suspension for a volume of gas or oil produced by all wells on your lease (see §§ 203.40 through 203.49).
(g) Located in a designated GOM shallow water area,
Drill and produce gas from an ultra-deep well on a lease that is not eligible for deep water royalty relief and you have not previously produced oil or gas from an ultra-deep well,
A royalty suspension for a volume of gas produced from successful ultra-deep and deep wells on your lease (see §§ 203.30 through 203.36).
(h) Located in planning areas offshore Alaska,
Propose an expansion project or propose a development project and can demonstrate that the project is uneconomic without relief or that the suspension volume, if any, for your lease is not enough to make development economic,
A royalty suspension for a minimum production volume plus any additional volume needed to make your project economic (see §§ 203.60, 203.62, 203.67 through 203.70, 203.73, and 203.76 through 203.79).
§ 203.3
Do I have to pay a fee to request royalty relief?
When you submit an application or ask for a preview assessment, you must include a fee to reimburse us for our costs of processing your application or assessment. Federal policy and law require us to recover the cost of services that confer special benefits to identifiable non-Federal recipients. The Independent Offices Appropriation Act (31 U.S.C. 9701), Office of Management and Budget Circular A-25, and the Omnibus Appropriations Bill (Pub. L. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, April 26, 1996) authorize us to collect these fees.
(a) We will specify the necessary fees for each of the types of royalty relief applications and possible BSEE audits in a Notice to Lessees. We will periodically update the fees to reflect changes in costs, as well as provide other information necessary to administer royalty relief.
(b) You must file all payments electronically through the
Fees for Services
page on the BSEE Web site at
http://www.bsee.gov,
and you must include a copy of the
Pay.gov
confirmation receipt page with your application or assessment.

The tables in this section summarize the similar application and approval provisions for the discretionary end-of-life and deep water royalty relief programs in §§ 203.50 to 203.91. Because royalty relief for deep gas on leases not subject to deep water royalty relief, as provided for under §§ 203.40 to 203.48, does not involve an application, its provisions do not parallel the other two royalty relief programs and are not summarized in this section.

# Subpart B—OCS Oil, Gas, and Sulfur General

# Royalty Relief for Drilling Ultra-Deep Wells on Leases Not Subject to Deep Water Royalty Relief
§ 203.30
Which leases are eligible for royalty relief as a result of drilling a phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?
Your lease may receive a royalty suspension volume (RSV) under §§ 203.31 through 203.36 if the lease meets all the requirements of this section.
(a) The lease is located in the GOM wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in water depths entirely less than 400 meters deep.
(b) The lease has not produced gas or oil from a deep well or an ultra-deep well, except as provided in § 203.31(b).
(c) If the lease is located entirely in more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters of water, it must either:
(1) Have been issued before November 28, 1995, and not been granted deep water royalty relief under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), added by section 302 of the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act; or
(2) Have been issued after November 28, 2000, and not been granted deep water royalty relief under §§ 203.60 through 203.79.
§ 203.31
If I have a qualified phase 2 or qualified phase 3 ultra-deep well, what royalty relief would that well earn for my lease?
(a) Subject to the administrative requirements of § 203.35 and the price conditions in § 203.36, your qualified well earns your lease an RSV shown in the following table in billions of cubic feet (BCF) or in thousands of cubic feet (MCF) as prescribed in § 203.33:
If you have a qualified phase 2 or qualified phase 3 ultra-deep well
that is:
Then your lease earns an RSV on this volume of gas production:
(1) An original well,
35 BCF.
(2) A sidetrack with a sidetrack measured depth of at least 20,000 feet,
35 BCF.
(3) An ultra-deep short sidetrack that is a phase 2 ultra-deep well,
4 BCF plus 600 MCF times
sidetrack measured depth (rounded to the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 25 BCF.
(4) An ultra-deep short sidetrack that is a phase 3 ultra-deep well,
0 BCF.
(b)(1) This paragraph applies if your lease:
(i) Has produced gas or oil from a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is less than 18,000 feet TVD SS;
(ii) Was issued in a lease sale held between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2005; and
(iii) The terms of your lease expressly incorporate the provisions of §§ 203.41 through 203.47 as they existed at the time the lease was issued.
(2) Subject to the administrative requirements of § 203.35 and the price conditions in § 203.36, your qualified well earns your lease an RSV shown in the
following table in BCF or MCF as prescribed in § 203.33:
If you have a qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well that is . . .
Then your lease earns an RSV on this volume of gas production:
(i) An original well or a sidetrack with a sidetrack measured depth of at least 20,000 feet TVD SS,
10 BCF.
(ii) An ultra-deep short sidetrack,
4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack measured depth (rounded to the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 10 BCF.
(c) Lessees may request a refund of or recoup royalties paid on production from qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep wells that:
(1) Occurs before December 18, 2008, and
(2) Is subject to application of an RSV under either § 203.31 or § 203.41.
(d) The following examples illustrate how this section applies. These examples assume that your lease is located in the GOM west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude and in water less than 400 meters deep (see § 203.30(a)), has no existing deep or ultra-deep wells and that the price thresholds prescribed in § 203.36 have not been exceeded.

# Example 1:
In 2008, you drill and begin producing from an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 25,000 feet TVD SS, and your lease has had no prior production from a deep or ultra-deep well. Assuming your lease has no deepwater royalty relief (see § 203.30(c)), your lease is eligible (according to § 203.30(b)) to earn an RSV under § 203.31 because it has not yet produced from a deep well. Your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF under this section when this well begins producing. According to § 203.31(a), your 25,000 foot well qualifies your lease for this RSV because the well was drilled after the relief authorized here became effective (when the proposed version of this rule was published on May 18, 2007) and produced from an interval that meets the criteria for an ultra-deep well (
i.e.,
is a phase 2 ultra-deep well as defined in § 203.0). Then in 2014, you drill and produce from another ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 29,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no additional RSV under this section when this second ultra-deep well produces, because your lease no longer meets the condition in (§ 203.30(b)) of no production from a deep well. However, any remaining RSV earned by the first ultra-deep well on your lease would be applied to production from both the first and the second ultra-deep wells as prescribed in § 203.33(a)(2), or § 203.33(b)(2) if your lease is part of a unit.

# Example 2:
In 2005, you spudded and began producing from an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 23,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no RSV under this section from this phase 1 ultra-deep well (as defined in § 203.0) because you spudded the well before the publication date (May 18, 2007) of the proposed rule when royalty relief under § 203.31(a) became effective. However, this ultra-deep well may earn an RSV of 25 BCF for your lease under § 203.41 (that became effective May 3, 2004), if the lease is located in water depths partly or entirely less than 200 meters and has not previously produced from a deep well (§ 203.30(b)).

# Example 3:
In 2000, you began producing from a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and your lease is located in water 100 meters deep. Then in 2008, you drill and produce from a new ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 24,000 feet TVD SS. Your lease earns no RSV under either this section or § 203.41 because the 16,000-foot well was drilled before we offered any way to earn an RSV for producing from a deep well (see dates in the definition of qualified well in § 203.0) and because the existence of the 16,000-foot well means the lease is not eligible (see § 203.30(b)) to earn an RSV for the 24,000-foot well. Because the lease existed in the year 2000, it cannot be eligible for the exception to this eligibility condition provided in § 203.31(b).

# Example 4:
In 2008, you spud and produce from an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 22,000 feet TVD SS, your lease is located in water 300 meters deep, and your lease has had no previous production from a deep or ultra-deep well. Your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF under this section when this well begins producing because your lease meets the conditions in § 203.30 and the well fits the definition of a phase 2 ultra-deep well (in § 203.0). Then in 2010, you spud and produce from a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS. Your 16,000-foot well earns no RSV because it is on a lease that already has a producing well at least 18,000 feet subsea (see § 203.42(a)), but any remaining RSV earned by the ultra-deep well would also be applied to production from the deep well as prescribed in § 203.33(a)(2), or § 203.33(b)(2) if your lease is part of a unit and § 203.43(a)(2),
or § 203.43(b)(2) if your lease is part of a unit. However, if the 16,000-foot deep well does not begin production until 2016 (or if your lease were located in water less than 200 meters deep), then the 16,000-foot well would not be a qualified deep well because this well does not begin production within the interval specified in the definition of a qualified well in § 203.0, and the RSV earned by the ultra-deep well would not be applied to production from this (unqualified) deep well.

# Example 5:
In 2008, you spud a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 17,000 feet TVD SS that becomes a qualified well and earns an RSV of 15 BCF under § 203.41 when it begins producing. Then in 2011, you spud an ultra-deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 26,000 feet TVD SS. Your 26,000-foot well becomes a qualified ultra-deep well because it meets the date and depth conditions in this definition under § 203.0 when it begins producing, but your lease earns no additional RSV under this section or § 203.41 because it is on a lease that already has production from a deep well (see § 203.30(b)). Both the qualified deep well and the qualified ultra-deep well would share your lease's total RSV of 15 BCF in the manner prescribed in §§ 203.33 and 203.43.

# Example 6:
In 2008, you spud a qualified ultra-deep well that is a sidetrack with a sidetrack measured depth of 21,000 feet and a perforated interval the top of which is 25,000 feet TVD SS. This well meets the definition of an ultra-deep well but is too long to be classified an ultra-deep short sidetrack in § 203.0. If your lease is located in 150 meters of water and has not previously produced from a deep well, your lease earns an RSV of 35 BCF because it was drilled after the effective date for earning this RSV. Further, this RSV applies to gas production from this and any future qualified deep and qualified ultra-deep wells on your lease, as prescribed in § 203.33. The absence of an expiration date for earning an RSV on an ultra-deep well means this long sidetrack well becomes a qualified well whenever it starts production. If your sidetrack has a sidetrack measured depth of 14,000 feet and begins production in March 2009, it earns an RSV of 12.4 BCF under this section because it meets the definitions of a phase 2 ultra-deep well (production begins before the expiration date for the pre-existing relief in its water depth category) and an ultra-deep short sidetrack in § 203.0. However, if it does not begin production until 2010, it earns no RSV because it is too short as a phase 3 ultra-deep well to be a qualified ultra-deep well.

# Example 7:
Your lease was issued in June 2004 and expressly incorporates the provisions of §§ 203.41 through 203.47 as they existed at that time. In January 2005, you spud a deep well (well no. 1) with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,800 feet TVD SS that becomes a qualified well and earns an RSV of 15 BCF under § 203.41 when it begins producing. Then in February 2008, you spud an ultra-deep well (well no. 2) with a perforated interval the top of which is 22,300 feet that begins producing in November 2008, after well no. 1 has started production. Well no. 2 earns your lease an additional RSV of 10 BCF under paragraph (b) of this section because it begins production in time to be classified as a phase 2 ultra-deep well. If, on the other hand, well no. 2 had begun producing in June 2009, it would earn no additional RSV for the lease because it would be classified as a phase 3 ultra-deep well and thus is not entitled to the exception under paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 203.32
What other requirements or restrictions apply to royalty relief for a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?
(a) If a qualified ultra-deep well on your lease is within a unitized portion of your lease, the RSV earned by that well under this section applies only to your lease and not to other leases within the unit or to the unit as a whole.
(b) If your qualified ultra-deep well is a directional well (either an original well or a sidetrack) drilled across a lease line, then either:
(1) The lease with the perforated interval that initially produces earns the RSV or
(2) If the perforated interval crosses a lease line, the lease where the surface of the well is located earns the RSV.
(c) Any RSV earned under § 203.31 is in addition to any royalty suspension supplement (RSS) for your lease under § 203.45 that results from a different wellbore.
(d) If your lease earns an RSV under § 203.31 and later produces from a deep well that is not a qualified well, the RSV is not forfeited or terminated, but you may not apply the RSV earned under § 203.31 to production from the non-qualified well.
(e) You owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your lease terms notwithstanding any RSVs allowed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 203.31.
(f) Unused RSVs transfer to a successor lessee and expire with the lease.
§ 203.33
To which production do I apply the RSV earned by qualified phase 2 and phase 3 ultra-deep wells on my lease or in my unit?
(a) You must apply the RSV allowed in § 203.31(a) and (b) to gas volumes produced from qualified wells on or after May 18, 2007, reported on the Oil and Gas Operations Report, Part A (OGOR-A) for your lease under 30 CFR 1210.102. All gas production from qualified wells reported on the OGOR-A, including production not subject to royalty, counts toward the total lease RSV earned by both deep or ultra-deep wells on the lease.
(b) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well that is not within a BSEE-approved unit. Subject to the price conditions of § 203.36, you must apply the RSV prescribed in § 203.31 as required under the following paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
(1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of May 18, 2007, or the date the first qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).
(2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production from qualified wells on your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44.
(c) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well where all or part of the lease is within a BSEE-approved unit. Under the unit agreement, a share of the production from all the qualified wells in the unit participating area would be allocated to your lease each month according to the participating area percentages. Subject to the price conditions of § 203.36, you must apply the RSV prescribed in § 203.31 as follows:
(1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of May 18, 2007, or the date that the first qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).
(2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production:
(i) From qualified wells on the non-unitized area of your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44; and
(ii) Allocated to your lease under a BSEE-approved unit agreement from qualified wells on unitized areas of your lease and on other leases in participating areas of the unit, regardless of their depth, for which the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44 have been met. The allocated share under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section does not increase the RSV for your lease.

# Example:
The east half of your lease A is unitized with all of lease B. There is one qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well on the non-unitized portion of lease A that earns lease A an RSV of 35 BCF under § 203.31, one qualified deep well on the unitized portion of lease A (drilled after the ultra-deep well on the non-unitized portion of that lease) and a qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well on lease B that earns lease B a 35 BCF RSV under § 203.31. The participating area percentages allocate 40 percent of production from both of the unit qualified wells to lease A and 60 percent to lease B. If the non-unitized qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well on lease A produces 12 BCF, and the unitized qualified well on lease A produces 18 BCF, and the qualified well on lease B produces 37 BCF, then the production volume from and allocated to lease A to which the lease A RSV applies is 34 BCF [12 + (18 + 37)(0.40)]. The production volume allocated to lease B to which the lease B RSV applies is 33 BCF [(18 + 37)(0.60)]. None of the volumes produced from a well that is not within a unit participating area may be allocated to other leases in the unit.
(d) You must begin paying royalties when the cumulative production of gas from all qualified wells on your lease, or allocated to your lease under paragraph (b) of this section, reaches the applicable RSV allowed under § 203.31 or § 203.41. For the month in which cumulative production reaches this RSV, you owe royalties on the portion of gas production from or allocated to your lease that exceeds the RSV remaining at the beginning of that month.
§ 203.34
To which production may an RSV earned by qualified phase 2 and phase 3 ultra-deep wells on my lease not be applied?
You may not apply an RSV earned under § 203.31:
(a) To production from completions less than 15,000 feet TVD SS, except in cases where the qualified well is re-perforated in the same reservoir previously perforated deeper than 15,000 feet TVD SS;
(b) To production from a deep well or ultra-deep well on any other lease, except as provided in paragraph (c) of § 203.33;
(c) To any liquid hydrocarbon (oil and condensate) volumes; or
(d) To production from a deep well or ultra-deep well that commenced drilling before:
(1) March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep; or
(2) May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep.
§ 203.35
What administrative steps must I take to use the RSV earned by a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?
To use an RSV earned under § 203.31:
(a) You must notify the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development in writing of your intent to begin drilling operations on all your ultra-deep wells.
(b) Before beginning production, you must meet any production measurement requirements that the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development has determined are necessary under 30 CFR part 250, subpart L.
(c)(1) Within 30 days of the beginning of production from any wells that would become qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep wells by satisfying the requirements of this section:
(i) Provide written notification to the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development that production has begun; and
(ii) Request confirmation of the size of the RSV earned by your lease.
(2) If you produced from a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well before December 18, 2008, you must provide the information in paragraph (c)(1) of this section no later than January 20, 2009.
(d) If you cannot produce from a well that otherwise meets the criteria for a qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well that is an ultra-deep short sidetrack before May 3, 2009, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep, or before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters but less than 400 meters deep, the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development may extend the deadline for beginning production for up to 1 year, based on the circumstances of the particular well involved, if it meets all the following criteria.
(1) The delay occurred after drilling reached the total depth in your well.
(2) Production (other than test production) was expected to begin from the well before May 3, 2009, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep or before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters but less than 400 meters deep. You must provide a credible activity schedule with supporting documentation.
(3) The delay in beginning production is for reasons beyond your control, such as adverse weather and accidents which BSEE deems were unavoidable.
§ 203.36
Do I keep royalty relief if prices rise significantly?
(a) You must pay the Office of Natural Resources Revenue royalties on all gas production to which an RSV otherwise would be applied under § 203.33 for any calendar year in which the average daily closing New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas price exceeds the applicable threshold price shown in the following table.
A price threshold in year 2007 dollars of . . .
Applies to . . .
(1) $10.15 per MMBtu,
(i) The first 25 BCF of RSV earned under § 203.31(a) by a phase 2 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep issued before December 18, 2008; and
(ii) Any RSV earned under § 203.31(b) by a phase 2 ultra-deep well.
(2) $4.55 per MMBtu,
(i) Any RSV earned under § 203.31(a) by a phase 3 ultra-deep well unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold;
(ii) The last 10 BCF of the 35 BCF of RSV earned under § 203.31(a) by a phase 2 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep issued before December 18, 2008, and that is not a non-converted lease;
(iii) The last 15 BCF of the 35 BCF of RSV earned under § 203.31(a) by a phase 2 ultra-deep well on a non-converted lease;
(iv) Any RSV earned under § 203.31(a) by a phase 2 ultra-deep well on a lease in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep issued on or after December 18, 2008, unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold; and
(v) Any RSV earned under § 203.31(a) by a phase 2 ultra-deep well on a lease in water entirely more than 200 meters deep and entirely less than 400 meters deep.
(3) $4.08 per MMBtu,
(i) The first 20 BCF of RSV earned by a well that is located on a non-converted lease issued in OCS Lease Sale 178.
(4) $5.83 per MMBtu,
(i) The first 20 BCF of RSV earned by a well that is located on a non-converted lease issued in OCS Lease Sales 180, 182, 184, 185, or 187.
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, determine the threshold price for any calendar year after 2007 by:
(1) Determining the percentage of change during the year in the Department of Commerce's implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product; and
(2) Adjusting the threshold price for the previous year by that percentage.
(c) The following examples illustrate how this section applies.

# Example 1:
Assume that a lessee drills and begins producing from a qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well in 2008 on a lease issued in 2004 in less than 200 meters of water that earns the lease an RSV of 35 BCF. Further, assume the well produces a total of 18 BCF by the end of 2009 and in both of those years, the average daily NYMEX closing natural gas price is less than $10.15 (adjusted for inflation after 2007). The lessee does not pay royalty on the 18 BCF because the gas price threshold under paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to the first 25 BCF of this RSV earned by this phase 2 ultra-deep well. In 2010, the well produces another 13 BCF. In that year, the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price is greater than $4.55 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007), but less than $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007). The first 7 BCF produced in 2010 will exhaust the first 25 BCF (that is subject to the $10.15 threshold) of the 35 BCF RSV that the well earned. The lessee must pay royalty on the remaining 6 BCF produced in 2010, because it is subject to the $4.55 per MMBtu threshold under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section which was exceeded.

# Example 2:
Assume that a lessee:
(1) Drills and produces from well no.1, a qualified deep well in 2008 to a depth of 15,500 feet TVD SS that earns a 15 BCF RSV for the lease under § 203.41, which would be subject to a price threshold of $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007), meaning the lease is partly or entirely in less than 200 meters of water;
(2) Later in 2008, drills and produces from well no. 2, a second qualified deep well to a depth of 17,000 feet TVD SS that earns no additional RSV (see § 203.41(c)(1)); and
(3) In 2015, drills and produces from well no. 3, a qualified phase 3 ultra-deep well that earns no additional RSV since the lease already has an RSV established by prior deep well production. Further assume that in 2015, the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price exceeds $4.55 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) but does not exceed $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007). In 2015, any remaining RSV earned by well no. 1 (which would have been applied to production from well nos. 1 and 2 in the intervening years), would be applied to production from all three qualified wells. Because the price threshold applicable to that RSV was not exceeded, the production from all three qualified wells would be royalty-free until the 15 BCF RSV earned by well no. 1 is exhausted.

# Example 3:
Assume the same initial facts regarding the three wells as in Example 2. Further assume that well no. 1 stopped producing in 2011 after it had produced 8 BCF, and that well no. 2 stopped producing in 2012 after it had produced 5 BCF. Two BCF of the RSV earned by well no. 1 remain. That RSV would be applied to production from well no.
3 until it is exhausted, and the lessee therefore would not pay royalty on those 2 BCF produced in 2015, because the $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) price threshold is not exceeded. The determination of which price threshold applies to deep gas production depends on when the first qualified well earned the RSV for the lease, not on which wells use the RSV.

# Example 4:
Assume that in February 2010, a lessee completes and begins producing from an ultra-deep well (at a depth of 21,500 feet TVD SS) on a lease located in 325 meters of water with no prior production from any deep well and no deep water royalty relief. The ultra-deep well would be a phase 2 ultra-deep well (see definition in § 203.0), and would earn the lease an RSV of 35 BCF under §§ 203.30 and 203.31. Further assume that the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price exceeds $4.55 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) but does not exceed $10.15 per MMBtu (adjusted for inflation after 2007) during 2010. Because the lease is located in more than 200 but less than 400 meters of water, the $4.55 per MMBtu price threshold applies to the whole RSV (see paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section), and the lessee will owe royalty on all gas produced from the ultra-deep well in 2010.
(d) You must pay any royalty due under this section no later than March 31 of the year following the calendar year for which you owe royalty. If you do not pay by that date, you must pay late payment interest under 30 CFR 1218.54 from April 1 until the date of payment.
(e) Production volumes on which you must pay royalty under this section count as part of your RSV.

# Royalty Relief for Drilling Deep Gas Wells on Leases Not Subject to Deep Water Royalty Relief
§ 203.40
Which leases are eligible for royalty relief as a result of drilling a deep well or a phase 1 ultra-deep well?
Your lease may receive an RSV under §§ 203.41 through 203.44, and may receive an RSS under §§ 203.45 through 203.47, if it meets all the requirements of this section.
(a) The lease is located in the GOM wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in water depths entirely less than 400 meters deep.
(b) The lease has not produced gas or oil from a well with a perforated interval the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper that commenced drilling either:
(1) Before March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located partly or entirely in water less than 200 meters deep; or
(2) Before May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep.
(c) In the case of a lease located partly or entirely in water less than 200 meters deep, the lease was issued in a lease sale held either:
(1) Before January 1, 2001;
(2) On or after January 1, 2001, and before January 1, 2004, and, in cases where the original lease terms provided for an RSV for deep gas production, the lessee has exercised the option provided for in § 203.49; or
(3) On or after January 1, 2004, and the lease terms provide for royalty relief under §§ 203.41 through 203.47. (Note: Because the original § 203.41 has been divided into new §§ 203.41 and 203.42 and subsequent sections have been redesignated as §§ 203.43 through 203.48, royalty relief in lease terms for leases issued on or after January 1, 2004, should be read as referring to §§ 203.41 through 203.48.)
(d) If the lease is located entirely in more than 200 meters and less than 400 meters of water, it must either:
(1) Have been issued before November 28, 1995, and not been granted deep water royalty relief under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), added by section 302 of the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act; or
(2) Have been issued after November 28, 2000, and not been granted deep water royalty relief under §§ 203.60 through 203.79.
§ 203.41
If I have a qualified deep well or a qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well, what royalty relief would my lease earn?
(a) To qualify for a suspension volume under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, your lease must meet the requirements in § 203.40 and the requirements in the following table.
If your lease has not . . .
And if it later . . .
Then your lease . . .
(1) produced gas or oil from any deep well or ultra-deep well,
Has a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well,
earns an RSV specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) produced gas or oil from a well with a perforated interval whose top is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper,
Has a qualified deep well with a perforated interval whose top is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper or a qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well,
earns an RSV specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b) If your lease meets the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, it earns the RSV prescribed in the following table:
If you have a qualified deep well or a qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well that is:
Then your lease earns an RSV on this volume of gas production:
(1) An original well with a perforated interval the top of which is from 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS,
15 BCF.
(2) A sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is from 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS,
4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack measured depth (rounded to the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 15 BCF.
(3) An original well with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 18,000 feet TVD SS,
25 BCF.
(4) A sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 18,000 feet TVD SS,
4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack measured depth (rounded to the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 25 BCF.
(c) If your lease meets the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it earns the RSV prescribed in the following table. The RSV specified in this paragraph is in addition to any RSV your lease already may have earned from a qualified deep well with a perforated interval whose top is from 15,000 feet to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS.
If you have a qualified deep well or a qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well that is . . .
Then you earn an RSV on this amount of gas production:
(1) An original well or a sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is from 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS,
0 BCF.
(2) An original well with a perforated interval the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper,
10 BCF.
(3) A sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper,
4 BCF plus 600 MCF times sidetrack measured depth (rounded to the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 10 BCF.
(d) Lessees may request a refund of or recoup royalties paid on production from qualified wells on a lease that is located in water entirely deeper than 200 meters but entirely less than 400 meters deep that:
(1) Occurs before December 18, 2008; and
(2) Is subject to application of an RSV under either § 203.31 or § 203.41.
(e) The following examples illustrate how this section applies, assuming your lease meets the location, prior production, and lease issuance conditions in § 203.40 and paragraph (a) of this section:

# Example 1:
If you have a qualified deep well that is an original well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS, your lease earns an RSV of 15 BCF under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. This RSV must be applied to gas production from all qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48. However, if the top of the perforated interval is 18,500 feet TVD SS, the RSV is 25 BCF according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

# Example 2:
If you have a qualified deep well that is a sidetrack, with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and a sidetrack measured depth of 6,789 feet, we round the measured depth to 6,800 feet and your lease earns an RSV of 8.08 BCF under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This RSV would be applied to gas production from all qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48.

# Example 3:
If you have a qualified deep well that is a sidetrack, with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and a sidetrack measured depth of 19,500 feet, your lease earns an RSV of 15 BCF. This RSV would be applied to gas production from all qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48, even though 4 BCF plus 600 MCF per foot of sidetrack measured
depth equals 15.7 BCF because paragraph (b)(2) of this section limits the RSV for a sidetrack at the amount an original well to the same depth would earn.

# Example 4:
If you have drilled and produced a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS before March 26, 2003 (and the well therefore is not a qualified well and has earned no RSV under this section), and later drill:
(i) A deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 17,000 feet TVD SS, your lease earns no RSV (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section);
(ii) A qualified deep well that is an original well with a perforated interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS, your lease earns an RSV of 10 BCF under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This RSV would be applied to gas production from qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48; or
(iii) A qualified deep well that is a sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS, that has a sidetrack measured depth of 7,000 feet, your lease earns an RSV of 8.2 BCF under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. This RSV would be applied to gas production from qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48.

# Example 5:
If you have a qualified deep well that is an original well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS, and later drill a second qualified well that is an original well with a perforated interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS, we increase the total RSV for your lease from 15 BCF to 25 BCF under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. We will apply that RSV to gas production from all qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48. If the second well has a perforated interval the top of which is 22,000 feet TVD SS (instead of 19,000 feet), the total RSV for your lease would increase to 25 BCF only in 2 situations: (1) If the second well was a phase 1 ultra-deep well,
i.e.,
if drilling began before May 18, 2007, or (2) the exception in § 203.31(b) applies. In both situations, your lease must be partly or entirely in less than 200 meters of water and production must begin on this well before May 3, 2009. If drilling of the second well began on or after May 18, 2007, the second well would be qualified as a phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well and, unless the exception in § 203.31(b) applies, would not earn any additional RSV (as prescribed in § 203.30), so the total RSV for your lease would remain at 15 BCF.

# Example 6:
If you have a qualified deep well that is a sidetrack, with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and a sidetrack measured depth of 4,000 feet, and later drill a second qualified well that is a sidetrack, with a perforated interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS and a sidetrack measured depth of 8,000 feet, we increase the total RSV for your lease from 6.4 BCF [4 + (600 * 4,000)/1,000,000] to 15.2 BCF {6.4 + [4 + (600 * 8,000)/1,000,000)]} under paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(3) of this section. We would apply that RSV to gas production from all qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48. The difference of 8.8 BCF represents the RSV earned by the second sidetrack that has a perforated interval the top of which is deeper than 18,000 feet TVD SS.
§ 203.42
What conditions and limitations apply to royalty relief for deep wells and phase 1 ultra-deep wells?
The conditions and limitations in the following table apply to royalty relief under § 203.41.
If . . .
Then . . .
(a) Your lease has produced gas or oil from a well with a perforated interval the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper,
your lease cannot earn an RSV under § 203.41 as a result of drilling any subsequent deep wells or phase 1 ultra-deep wells.
(b) You determine RSV under § 203.41 for the first qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on your lease (whether an original well or a sidetrack) because you drilled and produced it within the time intervals set forth in the definitions for qualified wells,
that determination establishes the total RSV available for that drilling depth interval on your lease (
i.e.,
either 15,000-18,000 feet TVD SS, or 18,000 feet TVD SS and deeper), regardless of the number of subsequent qualified wells you drill to that depth interval.
(c) A qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on your lease is within a unitized portion of your lease,
the RSV earned by that well under § 203.41 applies only to production from qualified wells on or allocated to your lease and not to other leases within the unit.
(d) Your qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well is a directional well (either an original well or a sidetrack) drilled across a lease line,
the lease with the perforated interval that initially produces earns the RSV. However, if the perforated interval crosses a lease line, the lease where the surface of the well is located earns the RSV.
(e) You earn an RSV under § 203.41,
that RSV is in addition to any RSS for your lease under § 203.45 that results from a different wellbore.
(f) Your lease earns an RSV under § 203.41 and later produces from a well that is not a qualified well,
the RSV is not forfeited or terminated, but you may not apply the RSV under § 203.41 to production from the non-qualified well.
(g) You qualify for an RSV under paragraphs (b) or (c) of § 203.41,
you still owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your lease terms.
(h) You transfer your lease,
unused RSVs transfer to a successor lessee and expire with the lease.

# Example to paragraph (b):
If your first qualified deep well is a sidetrack with a perforated interval whose top is 16,000 feet TVD SS and earns an RSV of 12.5 BCF, and you later drill a qualified original deep well to 17,000 feet TVD SS, the RSV for your lease remains at 12.5 BCF and does not increase to 15 BCF. However, under paragraph (c) of § 203.41, if you subsequently drill a qualified deep well to a depth of 18,000 feet or greater TVD SS, you may earn an additional RSV.
§ 203.43
To which production do I apply the RSV earned from qualified deep wells or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep wells on my lease?
(a) You must apply the RSV prescribed in § 203.41(b) and (c) to gas volumes produced from qualified wells on or after May 3, 2004, reported on the OGOR-A for your lease under 30 CFR 1210.102, as and to the extent prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, all gas production from qualified wells reported on the OGOR-A, including production that is not subject to royalty, counts toward the lease RSV.
(2) Production to which an RSS applies under §§ 203.45 and 203.46 does not count toward the lease RSV.
(b) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well when no part of the lease is within a BSEE-approved unit. Subject to the price conditions in § 203.48, you must apply the RSV prescribed in § 203.41 as required under the following paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
(1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of:
(i) May 3, 2004, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep;
(ii) May 18, 2007, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep; or
(iii) The date that the first qualified well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).
(2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production from qualified wells on your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44.

# Example 1:
On a lease in water less than 200 meters deep, you began drilling an original deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 18,200 feet TVD SS in September 2003, that became a qualified deep well in July 2004, when it began producing and using the RSV that it earned. You subsequently drill another original deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,600 feet TVD SS, which becomes a qualified deep well when production begins in August 2008. The first well earned an RSV of 25 BCF (see § 203.41(a)(1) and (b)(3)). You must apply any remaining RSV each month beginning in August 2008 to production from both wells until the 25 BCF RSV is fully utilized according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the second well had begun production in August 2009, it would not be a qualified deep well because it started production after expiration in May 2009 of the ability to qualify for royalty relief in this water depth, and could not share any of the remaining RSV (see definition of a qualified deep well in § 203.0).

# Example 2:
On a lease in water between 200 and 400 meters deep, you begin drilling an original deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 17,100 feet TVD SS in November 2010 that becomes a qualified deep well in June 2011 when it begins producing and using the RSV. You subsequently drill another original deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is 15,300 feet TVD SS which becomes a qualified deep well by beginning production in October 2011 (see definition of a qualified deep well in § 203.0). Only the first well earns an RSV equal to 15 BCF (see § 203.41(a) and (b)). You must apply any remaining RSV each month beginning in October 2011 to production from both qualified deep wells until the 15 BCF RSV is fully utilized according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(c) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well when all or part of the lease is within a BSEE-approved unit. Under the unit agreement, a share of the production from all the qualified wells in the unit
participating area would be allocated to your lease each month according to the participating area percentages. Subject to the price conditions in § 203.48, you must apply the RSV prescribed under § 203.41 as required under the following paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of:
(i) May 3, 2004, for an RSV earned by a qualified well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep;
(ii) May 18, 2007, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep; or
(iii) The date that the first qualified well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).
(2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production:
(i) From all qualified wells on the non-unitized area of your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44; and,
(ii) Allocated to your lease under a BSEE-approved unit agreement from qualified wells on unitized areas of your lease and on unitized areas of other leases in the unit, regardless of their depth, for which the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44 have been met.
(3) The allocated share under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section does not increase the RSV for your lease. None of the volumes produced from a well that is not within a unit participating area may be allocated to other leases in the unit.

# Example:
The east half of your lease A is unitized with all of lease B. There is one qualified 19,000-foot TVD SS deep well on the non-unitized portion of lease A, one qualified 18,500-foot TVD SS deep well on the unitized portion of lease A, and a qualified 19,400-foot TVD SS deep well on lease B. The participating area percentages allocate 32 percent of production from both of the unit qualified deep wells to lease A and 68 percent to lease B. If the non-unitized qualified deep well on lease A produces 12 BCF and the unitized qualified deep well on lease A produces 15 BCF, and the qualified deep well on lease B produces 10 BCF, then the production volume from and allocated to lease A to which the lease an RSV applies is 20 BCF [12 + (15 + 10) * (0.32)]. The production volume allocated to lease B to which the lease B RSV applies is 17 BCF [(15 + 10) * (0.68)].
(d) You must begin paying royalties when the cumulative production of gas from all qualified wells on your lease, or allocated to your lease under paragraph (c) of this section, reaches the applicable RSV allowed under § 203.31 or § 203.41. For the month in which cumulative production reaches this RSV, you owe royalties on the portion of gas production that exceeds the RSV remaining at the beginning of that month.
(e) You may not apply the RSV allowed under § 203.41 to:
(1) Production from completions less than 15,000 feet TVD SS, except in cases where the qualified deep well is re-perforated in the same reservoir previously perforated deeper than 15,000 feet TVD SS;
(2) Production from a deep well or phase 1 ultra-deep well on any other lease, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section;
(3) Any liquid hydrocarbon (oil and condensate) volumes; or
(4) Production from a deep well or phase 1 ultra-deep well that commenced drilling before:
(i) March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep, or
(ii) May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep.
§ 203.44
What administrative steps must I take to use the royalty suspension volume?
(a) You must notify the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development in writing of your intent to begin drilling operations on all deep wells and phase 1 ultra-deep wells; and
(b) Within 30 days of the beginning of production from all wells that would become qualified wells by satisfying the requirements of this section, you must:
(1) Provide written notification to the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development that production has begun; and
(2) Request confirmation of the size of the royalty suspension volume earned by your lease.
(c) Before beginning production, you must meet any production measurement requirements that the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development has determined are necessary under 30 CFR part 250, subpart L.
(d) You must provide the information in paragraph (b) of this section by January 20, 2009, if you produced before December 18, 2008, from a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters and less than 400 meters deep.
(e) The BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development may extend the deadline for beginning production for up to one year for a well that cannot begin production before the applicable date prescribed in the definition of “qualified deep well” in § 203.0 if it meets all of the following criteria.
(1) The well otherwise meets the criteria in the definition of a qualified deep well in § 203.0.
(2) The delay in production occurred after reaching total depth in the well.
(3) Production (other than test production) was expected to begin from the well before the applicable deadline in the definition of a qualified deep well in § 203.0. You must provide a credible activity schedule with supporting documentation.
(4) The delay in beginning production is for reasons beyond your control, such as adverse weather and accidents which BSEE deems were unavoidable.
§ 203.45
If I drill a certified unsuccessful well, what royalty relief will my lease earn?
Your lease may earn a royalty suspension supplement. Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the royalty suspension supplement is in addition to any royalty suspension volume your lease may earn under § 203.41.
(a) If you drill a certified unsuccessful well and you satisfy the administrative requirements of § 203.47, subject to the price conditions in § 203.48, your lease earns an RSS shown in the following table. The RSS is shown in billions of cubic feet of gas equivalent (BCFE) or in thousands of cubic feet of gas equivalent (MCFE) and is applicable to oil and gas production as prescribed in § 203.46.
If you have a certified unsuccessful well that is:—
Then your lease earns an RSS on this volume of oil and gas production as prescribed in this section and § 203.46:—
(1) An original well and your lease has not produced gas or oil from a deep well or an ultra-deep well,
5 BCFE.
(2) A sidetrack (with a sidetrack measured depth of at least 10,000 feet) and your lease has not produced gas or oil from a deep well or an ultra-deep well,
0.8 BCFE plus 120 MCFE times sidetrack measured depth (rounded to the nearest 100 feet) but no more than 5 BCFE.
(3) An original well or a sidetrack (with a sidetrack measured depth of at least 10,000 feet) and your lease has produced gas or oil from a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is from 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS,
2 BCFE.
(b) This paragraph applies to oil and gas volumes you report on the OGOR-A for your lease under 30 CFR 1210.102.
(1) You must apply the RSS prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, in accordance with the requirements in § 203.46, to all oil and gas produced from the lease:
(i) On or after December 18, 2008, if your lease is located in water more than 200 meters but less than 400 meters deep; or
(ii) On or after May 3, 2004, if your lease is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep.
(2) Production to which an RSV applies under §§ 203.31 through 203.33 and §§ 203.41 through 203.43 does not count toward the lease RSS. All other production, including production that is not subject to royalty, counts toward the lease RSS.

# Example 1:
If you drill a certified unsuccessful well that is an original well to a target 19,000 feet TVD SS, your lease earns an RSS of 5 BCFE that would be applied to gas
and oil production if your lease has not previously produced from a deep well or an ultra-deep well, or you earn an RSS of 2 BCFE of gas and oil production if your lease has previously produced from a deep well with a perforated interval from 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS, as prescribed in § 203.46.

# Example 2:
If you drill a certified unsuccessful well that is a sidetrack that reaches a target 19,000 feet TVD SS, that has a sidetrack measured depth of 12,545 feet, and your lease has not produced gas or oil from any deep well or ultra-deep well, BSEE rounds the sidetrack measured depth to 12,500 feet and your lease earns an RSS of 2.3 BCFE of gas and oil production as prescribed in § 203.45.
(c) The conversion from oil to gas for using the royalty suspension supplement is specified in § 203.73.
(d) Each lease is eligible for up to two royalty suspension supplements. Therefore, the total royalty suspension supplement for a lease cannot exceed 10 BCFE.
(1) You may not earn more than one royalty suspension supplement from a single wellbore.
(2) If you begin drilling a certified unsuccessful well on one lease but the completion target is on a second lease, the entire royalty suspension supplement belongs to the second lease. However, if the target straddles a lease line, the lease where the surface of the well is located earns the royalty suspension supplement.
(e) If the same wellbore that earns an RSS as a certified unsuccessful well later produces from a perforated interval the top of which is 15,000 feet TVD or deeper and becomes a qualified well, it will be subject to the following conditions:
(1) Beginning on the date production starts, you must stop applying the royalty suspension supplement earned by that wellbore to your lease production.
(2) If the completion of this qualified well is on your lease or, in the case of a directional well, is on another lease, then you must subtract from the royalty suspension volume earned by that qualified well the royalty suspension supplement amounts earned by that wellbore that have already been applied either on your lease or any other lease. The difference represents the royalty suspension volume earned by the qualified well.
(f) If the same wellbore that earned a royalty suspension supplement later has a sidetrack drilled from that wellbore, you are not required to subtract any royalty suspension supplement earned by that wellbore from the royalty suspension volume that may be earned by the sidetrack.
(g) You owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your lease terms notwithstanding any royalty suspension supplements under this section.
§ 203.46
To which production do I apply the royalty suspension supplements from drilling one or two certified unsuccessful wells on my lease?
(a) Subject to the requirements of §§ 203.40, 203.43, 203.45, 203.47, and 203.48 you must apply an RSS in § 203.45 to the earliest oil and gas production:
(1) Occurring on and after the day you file the information under § 203.47(b),
(2) From, or allocated under a BSEE-approved unit agreement to, the lease on which the certified unsuccessful well was drilled, without regard to the drilling depth of the well producing the gas or oil.
(b) If you have a royalty suspension volume for the lease under § 203.41, you must use the royalty suspension volumes for gas produced from qualified wells on the lease before using royalty suspension supplements for gas produced from qualified wells.

# Example to paragraph (b):
You have two shallow oil wells on your lease. Then you drill a certified unsuccessful well and earn a royalty suspension supplement of 5 BCFE. Thereafter, you begin production from an original well that is a qualified well that earns a royalty suspension volume of 15 BCF. You use only 2 BCFE of the royalty suspension supplement before the oil wells deplete. You must use up the 15 BCF of royalty suspension volume before you use the remaining 3 BCFE of the royalty suspension supplement for gas produced from the qualified well.
(c) If you have no current production on which to apply the RSS allowed under § 203.45, your RSS applies to the earliest subsequent production of gas and oil from, or allocated under a BSEE-approved unit agreement to, your lease.
(d) Unused royalty suspension supplements transfer to a successor lessee and expire with the lease.
(e) You may not apply the RSS allowed under § 203.45 to production from any other lease, except for production allocated to your lease from a BSEE-approved unit agreement. If your certified unsuccessful well is on a lease subject to a BSEE-approved unit agreement, the lessees of other leases in the unit may not apply any portion of the RSS for your lease to production from the other leases in the unit.
(f) You must begin or resume paying royalties when cumulative gas and oil production from, or allocated under a BSEE-approved unit agreement to, your lease (excluding any gas produced from qualified wells subject to a royalty suspension volume allowed under § 203.41) reaches the applicable royalty suspension supplement. For the month in which the cumulative production reaches this royalty suspension supplement, you owe royalties on the portion of gas or oil production that exceeds the amount of the royalty suspension supplement remaining at the beginning of that month.
§ 203.47
What administrative steps do I take to obtain and use the royalty suspension supplement?
(a) Before you start drilling a well on your lease targeted to a reservoir at least 18,000 feet TVD SS, you must notify, in writing, the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development of your intent to begin drilling operations and the depth of the target.
(b) After drilling the well, you must provide the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development within 60 days after reaching the total depth in your well:
(1) Information that allows BSEE to confirm that you drilled a certified unsuccessful well as defined under § 203.0, including:
(i) Well log data, if your original well or sidetrack does not meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 550, subpart A; or
(ii) Well log, well test, seismic, and economic data, if your well does meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 550, subpart A; and
(2) Information that allows BSEE to confirm the size of the royalty suspension supplement for a sidetrack, including sidetrack measured depth and supporting documentation.
(c) If you commenced drilling a well that otherwise meets the criteria for a certified unsuccessful well on a lease located entirely in more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters of water on or after May 18, 2007, and finished it before December 18, 2008, you must provide the information in paragraph (b) of this section no later than February 17, 2009.
§ 203.48
Do I keep royalty relief if prices rise significantly?
(a) You must pay royalties on all gas and oil production for which an RSV or an RSS otherwise would be allowed under §§ 203.40 through 203.47 for any calendar year when the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price exceeds the applicable threshold price shown in the following table.
For a lease located in water . . .
And issued . . .
The applicable threshold price is . . .
(1) Partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep,
before December 18, 2008,
$10.15 per MMBtu, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation.
(2) Partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep,
after December 18, 2008,
$4.55 per MMBtu, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold.
(3) Entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep,
on any date,
$4.55 per MMBtu, adjusted annually after calendar year 2007 for inflation unless the lease terms prescribe a different price threshold.
(b) Determine the threshold price for any calendar year after 2007 by adjusting the threshold price in the previous year by the percentage that the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product, as published by the Department of Commerce, changed during the calendar year.
(c) You must pay any royalty due under this section no later than March
31 of the year following the calendar year for which you owe royalty. If you do not pay by that date, you must pay late payment interest under 30 CFR 1218.54 from April 1 until the date of payment.
(d) Production volumes on which you must pay royalty under this section count as part of your RSV and RSS.
§ 203.49
May I substitute the deep gas drilling provisions in this part for the deep gas royalty relief provided in my lease terms?
(a) You may exercise an option to replace the applicable lease terms for royalty relief related to deep-well drilling with those in § 203.0 and §§ 203.40 through 203.48 if you have a lease issued with royalty relief provisions for deep-well drilling. Such leases:
(1) Must be issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after January 1, 2001, and before April 1, 2004; and
(2) Must be located wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in the GOM entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep.
(b) To exercise the option under paragraph (a) of this section, you must notify, in writing, the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development of your decision before September 1, 2004, or 180 days after your lease is issued, whichever is later, and specify the lease and block number.
(c) Once you exercise the option under paragraph (a) of this section, you are subject to all the activity, timing, and administrative requirements pertaining to deep gas royalty relief as specified in §§ 203.40 through 203.48.
(d) Exercising the option under paragraph (a) of this section is irrevocable. If you do not exercise this option, then the terms of your lease apply.

# Royalty Relief for End-of-Life Leases
§ 203.50
Who may apply for end-of-life royalty relief?
You may apply for royalty relief in two situations.
(a) Your end-of-life lease (as defined in § 203.2) is an oil and gas lease and has average daily production of at least 100 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per month (as calculated in § 203.73) in at least 12 of the past 15 months. The most recent of these 12 months are considered the qualifying months. These 12 months should reflect the basic operation you intend to use until your resources are depleted. If you changed your operation significantly (e.g., begin re-injecting rather than recovering gas) during the qualifying months, or if you do so while we are processing your application, we may defer action on your application until you revise it to show the new circumstances.
(b) Your end-of-life lease is other than an oil and gas lease (e.g., sulphur) and has production in at least 12 of the past 15 months. The most recent of these 12 months are considered the qualifying months.
§ 203.51
How do I apply for end-of-life royalty relief?
You must submit a complete application and the required fee to the appropriate BSEE Regional Director. Your BSEE regional office will provide specific guidance on the report formats. A complete application for relief includes:
(a) An administrative information report (specified in § 203.83) and
(b) A net revenue and relief justification report (specified in § 203.84).
§ 203.52
What criteria must I meet to get relief?
(a) To qualify for relief, you must demonstrate that the sum of royalty payments over the 12 qualifying months exceeds 75 percent of the sum of net revenues (before-royalty revenues minus allowable costs, as defined in § 203.84).
(b) To re-qualify for relief, e.g., either applying for additional relief on top of relief already granted, or applying for relief sometime after your earlier agreement terminated, you must demonstrate that:
(1) You have met the criterion listed in paragraph (a) of this section, and
(2) The 12 required qualifying months of operation have occurred under the current royalty arrangement.
§ 203.53
What relief will BSEE grant?
(a) If we approve your application and you meet certain conditions, we
will reduce the pre-application effective royalty rate by one-half on production up to the relief volume amount. If you produce more than the relief volume amount:
(1) We will impose a royalty rate equal to 1.5 times the effective royalty rate on your additional production up to twice the relief volume amount; and
(2) We will impose a royalty rate equal to the effective rate on all production greater than twice the relief volume amount.
(b) Regardless of the level of production or prices (see § 203.54), royalty payments due under end-of-life relief will not exceed the royalty obligations that would have been due at the effective royalty rate.
(1) The effective royalty rate is the average lease rate paid on production during the 12 qualifying months.
(2) The relief volume amount is the average monthly BOE production for the 12 qualifying months.
§ 203.54
How does my relief arrangement for an oil and gas lease operate if prices rise sharply?
In those months when your current reference price rises by at least 25 percent above your base reference price, you must pay the effective royalty rate on all monthly production.
(a) Your current reference price is a weighted average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas over the most recent full 12 calendar months;
(b) Your base reference price is a weighted average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas during the qualifying months; and
(c) Your weighting factors are the proportions of your total production volume (in BOE) provided by oil and gas during the qualifying months.
§ 203.55
Under what conditions can my end-of-life royalty relief arrangement for an oil and gas lease be ended?
(a) If you have an end-of-life royalty relief arrangement, you may renounce it at any time. The lease rate will return to the effective rate during the qualifying period in the first full month following our receipt of your renouncement of the relief arrangement.
(b) If you pay the effective lease rate for 12 consecutive months, we will terminate your relief. The lease rate will return to the effective rate in the first full month following this termination.
(c) We may stipulate in the letter of approval for individual cases certain events that would cause us to terminate relief because they are inconsistent with an end-of-life situation.
§ 203.56
Does relief transfer when a lease is assigned?
Yes. Royalty relief is based on the lease circumstances, not ownership. It transfers upon lease assignment.

# Royalty Relief for Pre-Act Deep Water Leases and for Development and Expansion Projects
§ 203.60
Who may apply for royalty relief on a case-by-case basis in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico or offshore of Alaska?
You may apply for royalty relief under §§ 203.61(b) and 203.62 for an individual lease, unit or project if you:
(a) Hold a pre-Act lease (as defined in § 203.0) that we have assigned to an authorized field (as defined in § 203.0);
(b) Propose an expansion project (as defined in § 203.0); or
(c) Propose a development project (as defined in § 203.0).
§ 203.61
How do I assess my chances for getting relief?
You may ask for a nonbinding assessment (a formal opinion on whether a field would qualify for royalty relief) before turning in your first complete application on an authorized field. This field must have a qualifying well under 30 CFR part 550, subpart A, or be on a lease that has allocated production under an approved unit agreement.
(a) To request a nonbinding assessment, you must:
(1) Submit a draft application in the format and detail specified in guidance from the BSEE regional office for the GOM;
(2) Propose to drill at least one more appraisal well if you get a favorable assessment; and
(3) Pay a fee under § 203.3.
(b) You must wait at least 90 days after receiving our assessment to apply for relief under § 203.62.
(c) This assessment is not binding because a complete application may contain more accurate information that does not support our original assessment. It will help you decide whether your proposed inputs for evaluating economic viability and your supporting data and assumptions are adequate.
§ 203.62
How do I apply for relief?
(a) You must send a complete application and the required fee to the BSEE Regional Director for your region.
(b) Your application for royalty relief offshore Alaska or in deep water in the GOM must include an original and two copies (one set of digital information) of:
(1) Administrative information report;
(2) Economic viability and relief justification report;
(3) G
G report;
(4) Engineering report;
(5) Production report; and
(6) Cost report.
(c) Section 203.82 explains why we are authorized to require these reports.
(d) Sections 203.81, 203.83, and 203.85 through 203.89 describe what these reports must include. The BSEE regional office for your region will guide you on the format for the required reports, and we encourage you to contact this office before preparing your application for this guidance.
§ 203.63
Does my application have to include all leases in the field?
(a) For authorized fields, we will accept only one joint application for all leases that are part of the designated field on the date of application, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and § 203.64. However, we will evaluate all acreage that may eventually become part of the authorized field. Therefore, if you have any other leases that you believe may eventually be part of the authorized field, you must submit data for these leases according to § 203.81.
(1) The Regional Director maintains a Field Names Master List with updates of all leases in each designated field.
(2) To avoid sharing proprietary data with other lessees on the field, you may submit your proprietary G
G report separately from the rest of your application. Your application is not complete until we receive all the required information for each lease on the field. We will not disclose proprietary data when explaining our assumptions and reasons for our determinations under § 203.67.
(3) We will not require a joint application if you show good cause and honest effort to get all lessees in the field to participate. If you must exclude a lease from your application because its lessee will not participate, that lease is ineligible for the royalty relief for the designated field.
(b) If your application seeks only relief for a development project or an expansion project, your application does not have to include all leases in the field.
§ 203.64
How many applications may I file on a field or a development project?
You may file one complete application for royalty relief during the life of the field or for a development project or an expansion project designed to produce a reservoir or set of reservoirs. However, you may send another application if:
(a) You are eligible to apply for a redetermination under § 203.74;
(b) You apply for royalty relief for an expansion project;
(c) You withdraw the application before we make a determination; or
(d) You apply for end-of-life royalty relief.
§ 203.65
How long will BSEE take to evaluate my application?
(a) We will determine within 20 working days if your application for royalty relief is complete. If your application is incomplete, we will explain in writing what it needs. If you withdraw a complete application, you may reapply.
(b) We will evaluate your first application on a field within 180 days, evaluate your first application on a development project or an expansion project
within 150 days and evaluate a redetermination under § 203.75 within 120 days after we determine that it is complete.
(c) We may ask to extend the review period for your application under the conditions in the following table.
If . . .
Then we may . . .
(1) We need more records to audit sunk costs,
Ask to extend the 120-day or 180-day evaluation period. The extension we request will equal the number of days between when you receive our request for records and the day we receive the records.
(2) We cannot evaluate your application for a valid reason, such as missing vital information or inconsistent or inconclusive supporting data,
Add another 30 days. We may add more than 30 days, but only if you agree.
(3) We need more data, explanations, or revision,
Ask to extend the 120-day or 180-day evaluation period. The extension we request will equal the number of days between when you receive our request and the day we receive the information.
(d) We may change your assumptions under § 203.62 if our technical evaluation reveals others that are more appropriate. We may consult with you before a final decision and will explain any changes.
(e) We will notify all designated lease operators within a field when royalty relief is granted.
§ 203.66
What happens if BSEE does not act in the time allowed?
If we do not act within the timeframes established under § 203.65, you get royalty relief according to the following table.
If you apply for royalty relief for
And we do not decide within the time specified,
As long as you
(a) An authorized field,
You get the minimum suspension volumes specified in § 203.69,
Abide by §§ 203.70 and 203.76.
(b) An expansion project,
You get a royalty suspension for the first year of production,
Abide by §§ 203.70 and 203.76.
(c) A development project,
You get a royalty suspension for initial production for the number of months that a decision is delayed beyond the stipulated timeframes set by § 203.65, plus all the royalty suspension volume for which you qualify,
Abide by §§ 203.70 and 203.76.
§ 203.67
What economic criteria must I meet to get royalty relief on an authorized field or project?
We will not approve applications if we determine that royalty relief cannot make the field, development project, or expansion project economically viable. Your field or project must be uneconomic while you are paying royalties and must become economic with royalty relief.
§ 203.68
What pre-application costs will BSEE consider in determining economic viability?
(a) We will not consider ineligible costs as set forth in § 203.89(h) in determining economic viability for purposes of royalty relief.
(b) We will consider sunk costs according to the following table.
We will . . .
When determining . . .
(1) Include sunk costs,
Whether a field that includes a pre-Act lease which has not produced, other than test production, before the application or redetermination submission date needs relief to become economic.
(2) Not include sunk costs,
Whether an authorized field, a development project, or an expansion project can become economic with full relief (see § 203.67).
(3) Not include sunk costs,
How much suspension volume is necessary to make the field, a development project, or an expansion project economic (see § 203.69(c)).
(4) Include sunk costs for the project discovery well on each lease,
Whether a development project or an expansion project needs relief to become economic.
§ 203.69
If my application is approved, what royalty relief will I receive?
If we approve your application, subject to certain conditions, we will not collect royalties on a specified suspension volume for your field, development project, or expansion project. Suspension volumes include volumes allocated to a lease under an approved unit agreement, but exclude any volumes of production that are not normally royalty-bearing under the lease or the regulations of this chapter (e.g., fuel gas).
(a) For authorized fields, the minimum royalty-suspension volumes are:
(1) 17.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) for fields in 200 to 400 meters of water;
(2) 52.5 MMBOE for fields in 400 to 800 meters of water; and
(3) 87.5 MMBOE for fields in more than 800 meters of water.
(b) For development projects, any relief we grant applies only to project wells and replaces the royalty relief, if any, with which we issued your lease.
(c) If your project is economic given the royalty relief with which we issued your lease, we will reject the application.
(d) If the lease has earned or may earn deep gas royalty relief under §§ 203.40 through 203.49 or ultra-deep gas royalty relief under §§ 203.30 through 203.36, we will take the deep gas royalty relief or ultra-deep gas royalty relief into account in determining whether further royalty relief for a development project is necessary for production to be economic.
(e) If neither paragraph (c) nor (d) of this section apply, the
minimum
royalty suspension volumes are as shown in the following table:
For . . .
The minimum royalty suspension volume is . . .
Plus . . .
(1) RS leases in the GOM or leases offshore Alaska,
A volume equal to the combined royalty suspension volumes (or the volume equivalent based on the data in your approved application for other forms of royalty suspension) with which BSEE issued the leases participating in the application that have or plan a well into a reservoir identified in the application,
10 percent of the median of the distribution of known recoverable resources upon which BSEE based approval of your application from all reservoirs included in the project.
(2) Leases offshore Alaska or other deep water GOM leases issued in sales after November 28, 2000,
A volume equal to 10 percent of the median of the distribution of known recoverable resources upon which BSEE based approval of your application from all reservoirs included in the project.
(f) If your application includes pre-Act leases in different categories of water depth, we apply the minimum royalty suspension volume for the deepest such lease then assigned to the field. We base the water depth and makeup of a field on the water-depth delineations in the “Lease Terms and Economic Conditions” map and the “Fields Directory” documents and updates in effect at the time your application is deemed complete. These publications are available from the BSEE Gulf of Mexico Regional Office.
(g) You will get a royalty suspension volume above the minimum if we determine that you need more to make the field or development project economic.
(h) For expansion projects, the minimum royalty suspension volume equals 10 percent of the median of the distribution of known recoverable resources upon which we based approval of your application from all reservoirs included in your project plus any suspension volumes required under § 203.66. If we determine that your expansion project may be economic only with more relief, we will determine and grant you the royalty suspension volume necessary to make the project economic.
(i) The royalty suspension volume applicable to specific leases will continue through the end of the month in which cumulative production reaches that volume. You must calculate cumulative production from all the leases in the authorized field or project that are entitled to share the royalty suspension volume.
§ 203.70
What information must I provide after BSEE approves relief?
You must submit reports to us as indicated in the following table. Sections 203.81, 203.90, and 203.91 describe what these reports must include. The BSEE Regional Office for your region will prescribe the formats.
Required report
When due to BSEE
Due date extensions
(a) Fabricator's confirmation report.
Within 18 months after approval of relief.
BSEE Director may grant you an extension under § 203.79(c) for up to 6 months.
(b) Post-production report.
Within 120 days after the start of production that is subject to the approved royalty suspension volume.
With acceptable justification from you, the BSEE Regional Director for your region may extend the due date up to 30 days.
§ 203.71
How does BSEE allocate a field's suspension volume between my lease and other leases on my field?
The allocation depends on when production occurs, when we issued the lease, when we assigned it to the field, and whether we award the volume suspension by an approved application or establish it in the lease terms, as prescribed in this section.
(a) If your authorized field has an approved royalty suspension volume under §§ 203.67 and 203.69, we will suspend payment of royalties on production from all leases in the field that participate in the application until their cumulative production equals the approved volume. The following conditions also apply:
If . . .
Then . . .
And . . .
(1) We assign an eligible lease to your authorized field after we approve relief,
We will not change your authorized field's royalty suspension volume determined under § 203.69,
Production from the assigned eligible lease(s) counts toward the royalty suspension volume for the authorized field, but the eligible lease will not share any remaining royalty suspension volume for the authorized field after the eligible lease has produced the volume applicable under 30 CFR 560.114.
(2) We assign a pre-Act or post-November 2000 deep water lease to your field after we approve your application,
We will not change your field's royalty suspension volume,
The assigned lease(s) may share in any remaining royalty relief by filing the short-form application specified in § 203.83 and authorized in § 203.82. An assigned RS lease also gets any portion of its royalty suspension volume remaining even after the field has produced the approved relief volume.
(3) We assign another lease that you operate to your field while we are evaluating your application,
In our evaluation of your authorized field, we will take into account the value of any royalty relief the added lease already has under 30 CFR 560.114 or its lease document. If we find your authorized field still needs additional royalty suspension volume, that volume will be at least the combined royalty suspension volume to which all added leases on the field are entitled, or the minimum suspension volume of the authorized field, whichever is greater,
(i) You toll the time period for evaluation until you modify your application to be consistent with the newly constituted field;
(ii) We have an additional 60 days to review the new information; and
(iii) The assigned pre-Act lease or royalty suspension lease shares the royalty suspension we grant to the newly constituted field. An eligible lease does not share the royalty suspension we grant to the new field. If you do not agree to toll, we will have to reject your application due to incomplete information. Production from an assigned eligible lease counts toward the royalty suspension volume that we grant under § 203.69 for your authorized field, but you will not owe royalty on production from the eligible lease until it has produced the volume applicable under 30 CFR 560.114.
(4) We assign another operator's lease to your field while we are evaluating your application,
We will change your field's minimum suspension volume provided the assigned lease joins the application and is entitled to a larger minimum suspension volume,
(i) You both toll the time period for evaluation until both of you modify your application to be consistent with the new field;
(ii) We have an additional 60 days to review the new information; and
(iii) The assigned lease(s) shares the royalty suspension we grant to the new field. If you (the original applicant) do not agree to toll, the other operator's lease retains any suspension volume it has or may share in any relief that we grant by filing the short form application specified in § 203.83 and authorized in § 203.82.
(5) We reassign a well on a pre-Act, eligible, or royalty suspension lease from field A to field B,
The past production from the well counts toward the royalty suspension volume that we grant under § 203.69 to field B,
For any field based relief, the past production for that well will not count toward any royalty suspension volume that we grant under § 203.69 to field A. Moreover, past production from that well will count toward the royalty suspension volume applicable for the lease under 30 CFR 560.114 if the well is on an eligible lease or under 30 CFR 560.124 if the well is on a royalty suspension lease.
(b) When a project has more than one lease, the royalty suspension volume for each lease equals that lease's actual production from the project (or production allocated under an approved unit agreement) until total production for all leases in the project equals the project's approved royalty suspension volume.
(c) You may receive a royalty-suspension volume only if your entire lease is west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude. If the field lies on both sides of this meridian, only leases located entirely west of the meridian will receive a royalty-suspension volume.
§ 203.72
Can my lease receive more than one suspension volume?
Yes. You may apply for royalty relief that involves more than one suspension volume under § 203.62 in two circumstances.
(a) Each field that includes your lease may receive a separate royalty-suspension volume, if it meets the evaluation criteria of § 203.67.
(b) An expansion project on your lease may receive a separate royalty-suspension volume, even if we have already granted a royalty-suspension volume to the field that encompasses the project. But the reserves associated with the project must not have been part of our original determination, and the project must meet the evaluation criteria of § 203.67.
§ 203.73
How do suspension volumes apply to natural gas?
You must measure natural gas production under the royalty-suspension volume as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, measured in accordance with 30 CFR part 250, subpart L, equals one barrel of oil equivalent.
§ 203.74
When will BSEE reconsider its determination?
You may request a redetermination after we withdraw approval or after you renounce royalty relief, unless we withdraw approval due to your providing false or intentionally inaccurate information. Under certain conditions you may also request a redetermination if we deny your application or if you want your approved royalty suspension volume to change. In these instances, to be eligible for a redetermination, at least one of the following four conditions must occur.
(a) You have significant new G
G data and you previously have not either requested a redetermination or reapplied for relief after we withdrew approval or you relinquished royalty relief. “Significant” means that the new G
G data:
(1) Results from drilling new wells or getting new three-dimensional seismic data and information (but not reinterpreting old data);
(2) Did not exist at the time of the earlier application; and
(3) Changes your estimates of gross resource size, quality, or projected flow rates enough to materially affect the results of our earlier determination.
(b) You demonstrate in your new application that the technology that most efficiently develops this field or lease was not considered or deemed feasible in the original application. Your newly proposed technology must improve the profitability, under equivalent market conditions, of the field or lease relative to the development system proposed in the prior application.
(c) Your current reference price decreases by more than 25 percent from your base reference price as calculated under this paragraph.
(1) Your current reference price is a weighted-average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas over the most recent full 12 calendar months;
(2) Your base reference price is a weighted average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas for the full 12 calendar months preceding the date of your most recently approved application for this royalty relief; and
(3) The weighting factors are the proportions of the total production volume (in BOE) for oil and gas associated with the most likely scenario (identified in §§ 203.85 and 203.88) from your most recently approved application for this royalty relief.
(d) Before starting to build your development and production system, you have revised your estimated development costs, and they are more than 120 percent of the eligible development costs associated with the most likely scenario from your most recently approved application for this royalty relief.
§ 203.75
What risk do I run if I request a redetermination?
If you request a redetermination after we have granted you a suspension volume, you could lose some or all of the previously granted relief. This can happen because you must file a new complete application and pay the required fee, as discussed in § 203.62. We will evaluate your application under § 203.67 using the conditions prevailing at the time of your redetermination request. In our evaluation, we may find that you should receive a larger, equivalent, smaller, or no suspension volume. This means we could find that you do not qualify for the amount of relief previously granted or for any relief at all.
§ 203.76
When might BSEE withdraw or reduce the approved size of my relief?
We will withdraw approval of relief for any of the following reasons.
(a) You change the type of development system proposed in your application (e.g., change from a fixed platform to floating production system, or from an independent development and production system to one with subsea wells tied back to a host production facility,
etc.
).
(b) You do not start building the proposed development and production system within 18 months of the date we approved your application, unless the BSEE Director grants you an extension under § 203.79(c). If you start building the proposed system and then suspend its construction before completion, and you do not restart continuous building of the proposed system within 18 months of our approval, we will withdraw the relief we granted.
(c) Your actual development costs are less than 80 percent of the eligible development costs estimated in your application's most likely scenario, and you do not report that fact in your post-production development report (§ 203.70). Development costs are those expenditures defined in § 203.89(b) incurred between the application submission date and start of production. If you report this fact in the post-production development report, you may retain the lesser of 50 percent of the original royalty suspension volume or 50 percent of the median of the distribution of the potentially recoverable resources anticipated in your application.
(d) We granted you a royalty-suspension volume after you qualified for a redetermination under § 203.74(c), and we find out your actual development costs are less than 90 percent of the eligible development costs associated with your application's most likely scenario. Development costs are those
expenditures defined in § 203.89(b) incurred between your application submission date and start of production.
(e) You do not send us the fabrication confirmation report or the post-production development report, or you provide false or intentionally inaccurate information that was material to our granting royalty relief under this section. You must pay royalties and late-payment interest determined under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 30 CFR 1218.54 on all volumes for which you used the royalty suspension. You also may be subject to penalties under other provisions of law.
§ 203.77
May I voluntarily give up relief if conditions change?
Yes, you may voluntarily give up relief by sending a letter to that effect to the BSEE Regional office for your region.
§ 203.78
Do I keep relief approved by BSEE under this part for my lease, unit or project if prices rise significantly?
If prices rise above a base price threshold for light sweet crude oil or natural gas, you must pay full royalties on production otherwise subject to royalty relief approved by BSEE under §§ 203.60-203.77 for your lease, unit or project as prescribed in this section.
(a) The following table shows the base price threshold for various types of leases, subject to paragraph (b) of this section. Note that, for post-November 2000 deepwater leases in the GOM, price thresholds apply on a lease basis, so different leases on the same development project or expansion project approved for royalty relief may have different price thresholds.
For . . .
The base price threshold is . . .
(1) Pre-Act leases in the GOM,
set by statute.
(2) Post-November 2000 deep water leases in the GOM or leases offshore of Alaska for which the lease or Notice of Sale set a base price threshold,
indicated in your original lease agreement or, if none, those in the Notice of Sale under which your lease was issued.
(3) Post-November 2000 deep water leases in the GOM or leases offshore of Alaska for which the lease or Notice of Sale did not set a base price threshold,
the threshold set by statute for pre-Act leases.
(b) An exception may occur if we determine that the price thresholds in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section mean the royalty suspension volume set under § 203.69 and in lease terms would provide inadequate encouragement to increase production or development, in which circumstance we could specify a different set of price thresholds on a case-by-case basis.
(c) Suppose your base oil price threshold set under paragraph (a) is $28.00 per barrel, and the daily closing NYMEX light sweet crude oil prices for the previous calendar year exceeds $28.00 per barrel, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section. In this case, we retract the royalty relief authorized in this subpart and you must:
(1) Pay royalties on all oil production for the previous year at the lease stipulated royalty rate plus interest (under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 30 CFR 1218.54) by March 31 of the current calendar year, and
(2) Pay royalties on all your oil production in the current year.
(d) Suppose your base gas price threshold set under paragraph (a) is $3.50 per million British thermal units (Btu), and the daily closing NYMEX light sweet crude oil prices for the previous calendar year exceeds $3.50 per million Btu, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section. In this case, we retract the royalty relief authorized in this subpart and you must:
(1) Pay royalties on all gas production for the previous year at the lease stipulated royalty rate plus interest (under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 30 CFR 1218.54) by March 31 of the current calendar year, and
(2) Pay royalties on all your gas production in the current year.
(e) Production under both paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section counts as part of the royalty-suspension volume.
(f) You are entitled to a refund or credit, with interest, of royalties paid on any production (that counts as part of the royalty-suspension volume):
(1) Of oil if the arithmetic average of the closing prices for the current calendar year is $28.00 per barrel or less, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section, and
(2) Of gas if the arithmetic average of the closing natural gas prices for the current calendar year is $3.50 per million Btu or less, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section.
(g) You must follow our regulations in the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, 30 CFR chapter XII, for receiving refunds or credits.
(h) We change the prices referred to in paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of this section periodically. For pre-Act leases, these prices change during each calendar year after 1994 by the percentage that the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product changed during the preceding calendar year. For post-November 2000 deepwater leases, these prices change as indicated in the lease instrument or in the Notice of Sale under which we issued the lease.
§ 203.79
How do I appeal BSEE's decisions related to royalty relief for a deepwater lease or a development or expansion project?
(a) Once we have designated your lease as part of a field and notified you and other affected operators of the designation, you can request reconsideration by sending the BSEE Director a letter within 15 days that also states your reasons. The BSEE Director's response is the final agency action.
(b) Our decisions on your application for relief from paying royalty under § 203.67 and the royalty-suspension volumes under § 203.69 are final agency actions.
(c) If you cannot start construction by the deadline in § 203.76(b) for reasons beyond your control (e.g., strike at the fabrication yard), you may request an extension up to 1 year by writing the BSEE Director and stating your reasons. The BSEE Director's response is the final agency action.
(d) We will notify you of all final agency actions by certified mail, return receipt requested. Final agency actions are not subject to appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 290 and 43 CFR part 4. They are judicially reviewable under section 10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 702)
only
if you file an action within 30 days of the date you receive our decision.
§ 203.80
When can I get royalty relief if I am not eligible for royalty relief under other sections in the subpart?
We may grant royalty relief when it serves the statutory purposes summarized in § 203.1 and our formal relief programs, including but not limited to the applicable levels of the royalty suspension volumes and price thresholds, provide inadequate encouragement to promote development or increase production. Unless your lease lies offshore of Alaska or wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in the GOM, your lease must be producing to qualify for relief. Before you may apply for royalty relief apart from our programs for end-of-life leases or for pre-Act deep water leases and development and expansion projects, we must agree that your lease or project has two or more of the following characteristics:
(a) The lease has produced for a substantial period and the lessee can recover significant additional resources. Significant additional resources mean enough to allow production for at least a year more than would be profitable without royalty relief.
(b) Valuable facilities (e.g., a platform or pipeline that would be removed upon lease relinquishment) exist that we do not expect a successor lessee to use. If the facilities are located off the lease, their preservation must depend on continued production from the lease applying for royalty relief. We will only consider an allocable share of costs for off-lease facilities in the relief application.
(c) A substantial risk exists that no new lessee will recover the resources.
(d) The lessee made major efforts to reduce operating costs too recently to use the formal program for royalty relief (e.g., recent significant change in operations).
(e) Circumstances beyond the lessee's control, other than water depth, preclude reliance on one of the existing royalty relief programs.

(c) With your application and post-production development report, you must submit an additional report prepared by an independent CPA that:
(1) Assesses the accuracy of the historical financial information in your report; and
(2) Certifies that the content and presentation of the financial data and information conform to our most recent guidelines on royalty relief. This means the data and information must:
(i) Include only eligible costs that are incurred during the qualification months; and
(ii) Be shown in the proper format.
(d) You must identify the people in the CPA firm who prepared the reports referred to in paragraph (c) of this section and make them available to us to respond to questions about the historical financial information. We may also further review your records to support this information.
§ 203.82
What is BSEE's authority to collect this information?
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the information collection requirements in part 203 under 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.,
and assigned OMB control number 1010-0071.
(a) We use the information to determine whether royalty relief will result in production that wouldn't otherwise occur. We rely largely on your information to make these determinations.
(1) Your application for royalty relief must contain enough information on finances, economics, reservoirs, G
G characteristics, production, and engineering estimates for us to determine whether:
(i) We should grant relief under the law, and
(ii) The requested relief will ultimately recover more resources and return a reasonable profit on project investments.
(2) Your fabricator confirmation and post-production development reports must contain enough information for us to verify that your application reasonably represented your plans.
(b) Applicants (respondents) are Federal OCS oil and gas lessees. Applications are required to obtain or retain a benefit. Therefore, if you apply for royalty relief, you must provide this information. We will protect information considered proprietary under applicable law and under regulations at § 203.63 and 30 CFR part 250.
(c) The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires us to inform you that we may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
(d) Send comments regarding any aspect of the collection of information under this part, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, VA 20166.

# Naming and Identifying Facilities and Wells (Does Not Include MODUs)
§ 250.150
How do I name facilities and wells in the Gulf of Mexico Region?
(a) Assign each facility a letter designation except for those types of facilities identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For example, A, B, CA, or CB.
(1) After a facility is installed, rename each predrilled well that was assigned only a number and was suspended temporarily at the mudline or at the surface. Use a letter and number
designation. The letter used must be the same as that of the production facility, and the number used must correspond to the order in which the well was completed, not necessarily the number assigned when it was drilled. For example, the first well completed for production on Facility A would be renamed Well A-1, the second would be Well A-2, and so on; and
(2) When you have more than one facility on a block, each facility installed, and not bridge-connected to another facility, must be named using a different letter in sequential order. For example, EC 222A, EC 222B, EC 222C.
(3) When you have more than one facility on multiple blocks in a local area being co-developed, each facility installed and not connected with a walkway to another facility should be named using a different letter in sequential order with the block number corresponding to the block on which the platform is located. For example, EC 221A, EC 222B, and EC 223C.
(b) In naming multiple well caissons, you must assign a letter designation.
(c) In naming single well caissons, you must use certain criteria as follows:
(1) For single well caissons not attached to a facility with a walkway, use the well designation. For example, Well No. 1;
(2) For single well caissons attached to a facility with a walkway, use the same designation as the facility. For example, rename Well No.10 as A-10; and
(3) For single well caissons with production equipment, use a letter designation for the facility name and a letter plus number designation for the well. For example, the Well No. 1 caisson would be designated as Facility A, and the well would be Well A-1.
§ 250.151
How do I name facilities in the Pacific Region?
The operator assigns a name to the facility.
§ 250.152
How do I name facilities in the Alaska Region?
Facilities will be named and identified according to the Regional Director's directions.
§ 250.153
Do I have to rename an existing facility or well?
You do not have to rename facilities installed and wells drilled before January 27, 2000, unless the Regional Director requires it.
§ 250.154
What identification signs must I display?
(a) You must identify all facilities, artificial islands, and mobile offshore drilling units with a sign maintained in a legible condition.
(1) You must display an identification sign that can be viewed from the waterline on at least one side of the platform. The sign must use at least 3-inch letters and figures.
(2) When helicopter landing facilities are present, you must display an additional identification sign that is visible from the air. The sign must use at least 12-inch letters and figures and must also display the weight capacity of the helipad unless noted on the top of the helipad. If this sign is visible to both helicopter and boat traffic, then the sign in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not required.
(3) Your identification sign must:
(i) List the name of the lessee or designated operator;
(ii) In the GOM OCS Region, list the area designation or abbreviation and the block number of the facility location as depicted on OCS Official Protraction Diagrams or leasing maps;
(iii) In the Pacific OCS Region, list the lease number on which the facility is located; and
(iv) List the name of the platform, structure, artificial island, or mobile offshore drilling unit.
(b) You must identify singly completed wells and multiple completions as follows:
(1) For each singly completed well, list the lease number and well number on the wellhead or on a sign affixed to the wellhead;
(2) For wells with multiple completions, downhole splitter wells, and multilateral wells, identify each completion in addition to the well name and lease number individually on the well flowline at the wellhead; and
(3) For subsea wells that flow individually into separate pipelines, affix the required sign on the pipeline or surface
flowline dedicated to that subsea well at a convenient location on the receiving platform. For multiple subsea wells that flow into a common pipeline or pipelines, no sign is required.

# Deepwater Operations Plan (DWOP) Process
§ 250.220
What is the DWOP process?
(a) The DWOP process consists of providing sufficient information from a total system approach for BSEE to review:
(1) A deepwater development project,
(2) A subsea tieback development technology, or
(3) Any other project or system that uses new or unusual technology during any phase of the following operations: drilling, completion, workover, intervention, injection, production, pipeline, platform, decommissioning, or abandonment.
(b) The DWOP process does not replace but complements other submittals required by the regulations, such as BOEM EPs, DPPs, and DOCDs, or BSEE applications and/or permits (
e.g.,
APD, Application for Permit to Modify (APM), pipeline application, and platform application). BSEE will use the information in your DWOP process to determine whether the project will be developed in an acceptable manner, particularly with respect to operational safety and environmental protection involved with a deepwater development project, subsea tieback development technology, or new or unusual technology.
(c) The DWOP process consists of two phases:
(1)
The Conceptual Plans.
The Conceptual Plans outline certain equipment and process specifications, operational concepts, and basis of design that you plan to use for project development, and for applicable equipment design, installation, and operation. Sections 250.227 through 250.229 prescribe what each of the Conceptual Plans must contain. Each Conceptual Plan may be submitted separately or combined as applicable; and
(2)
The DWOP.
The DWOP identifies specific design, fabrication, installation and operational requirements for equipment, systems, and activities as applicable in §§ 250.236 through 250.242.
(d) You must submit to BSEE the applicable plan(s) covered under the DWOP process as appropriate (see § 250.225 for Conceptual Plan requirements and § 250.235 for DWOP requirements). Certain projects requiring New or Unusual Technology Conceptual Plans or New or Unusual Technology Barrier Equipment Conceptual Plans may not be required to have an associated Project Conceptual Plan or DWOP.
§ 250.221
When must I use the DWOP process?
(a) You must use the DWOP process for any project that meets any of the following criteria:
(1) Is planned in water depths greater than 1000 ft;
(2) Will use subsea tieback development technology, regardless of water depth; or
(3) Will use any new or unusual technology for any drilling, completion, workover, intervention, injection, production, pipeline, platform, decommissioning, or abandonment project.
(b) If you are unsure if your project will use subsea tieback development technology or new or unusual technology, contact the Regional Supervisor for guidance.
§§ 250.222-250.224

# Subpart C—Pollution Prevention and Control
§ 250.300
Pollution prevention.
(a) During the exploration, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas or sulphur, the lessee shall take measures to prevent unauthorized discharge of pollutants into the offshore waters. The lessee shall not create conditions that will pose unreasonable risk to public health, life, property, aquatic life, wildlife, recreation, navigation, commercial fishing, or other uses of the ocean.
(1) When pollution occurs as a result of operations conducted by or on behalf of the lessee and the pollution damages or threatens to damage life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), or the marine, coastal, or human environment, the control and removal of the pollution to the satisfaction of the District Manager shall be at the expense of the lessee. Immediate corrective action shall be taken in all cases where pollution has occurred. Corrective action shall be subject to modification when directed by the District Manager.
(2) If the lessee fails to control and remove the pollution, the Director, in cooperation with other appropriate Agencies of Federal, State, and local
governments, or in cooperation with the lessee, or both, shall have the right to control and remove the pollution at the lessee's expense. Such action shall not relieve the lessee of any responsibility provided for by law.
(b)(1) The District Manager may restrict the rate of drilling fluid discharges or prescribe alternative discharge methods. The District Manager may also restrict the use of components that could cause unreasonable degradation to the marine environment. No petroleum-based substances, including diesel fuel, may be added to the drilling mud system without prior approval of the District Manager. For Arctic OCS exploratory drilling, you must capture all petroleum-based mud to prevent its discharge into the marine environment. The Regional Supervisor may also require you to capture, during your Arctic OCS exploratory drilling operations, all water-based mud from operations after completion of the hole for the conductor casing to prevent its discharge into the marine environment, based on various factors including, but not limited to:
(i) The proximity of your exploratory drilling operation to subsistence hunting and fishing locations;
(ii) The extent to which discharged mud may cause marine mammals to alter their migratory patterns in a manner that impedes subsistence users' access to, or use of, those resources, or increases the risk of injury to subsistence users; or
(iii) The extent to which discharged mud may adversely affect marine mammals, fish, or their habitat.
(2) You must obtain approval from the District Manager of the method you plan to use to dispose of drill cuttings, sand, and other well solids. For Arctic OCS exploratory drilling, you must capture all cuttings from operations that utilize petroleum-based mud to prevent their discharge into the marine environment. The Regional Supervisor may also require you to capture, during your Arctic OCS exploratory drilling operations, all cuttings from operations that utilize water-based mud after completion of the hole for the conductor casing to prevent their discharge into the marine environment, based on various factors including, but not limited to:
(i) The proximity of your exploratory drilling operation to subsistence hunting and fishing locations;
(ii) The extent to which discharged cuttings may cause marine mammals to alter their migratory patterns in a manner that impedes subsistence users' access to, or use of, those resources, or increases the risk of injury to subsistence users; or
(iii) The extent to which discharged cuttings may adversely affect marine mammals, fish, or their habitat.
(3) All hydrocarbon-handling equipment for testing and production such as separators, tanks, and treaters shall be designed, installed, and operated to prevent pollution. Maintenance or repairs which are necessary to prevent pollution of offshore waters shall be undertaken immediately.
(4) Curbs, gutters, drip pans, and drains shall be installed in deck areas in a manner necessary to collect all contaminants not authorized for discharge. Oil drainage shall be piped to a properly designed, operated, and maintained sump system which will automatically maintain the oil at a level sufficient to prevent discharge of oil into offshore waters. All gravity drains shall be equipped with a water trap or other means to prevent gas in the sump system from escaping through the drains. Sump piles shall not be used as processing devices to treat or skim liquids but may be used to collect treated-produced water, treated-produced sand, or liquids from drip pans and deck drains and as a final trap for hydrocarbon liquids in the event of equipment upsets. Improperly designed, operated, or maintained sump piles which do not prevent the discharge of oil into offshore waters shall be replaced or repaired.
(5) On artificial islands, all vessels containing hydrocarbons shall be placed inside an impervious berm or otherwise protected to contain spills. Drainage shall be directed away from the drilling rig to a sump. Drains and sumps shall be constructed to prevent seepage.
(6) Disposal of equipment, cables, chains, containers, or other materials into offshore waters is prohibited.
(c) Materials, equipment, tools, containers, and other items used in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) which are of such shape or configuration that they are likely to snag or damage fishing devices shall be handled and marked as follows:
(1) All loose material, small tools, and other small objects shall be kept in a suitable storage area or a marked container when not in use and in a marked container before transport over offshore waters;
(2) All cable, chain, or wire segments shall be recovered after use and securely stored until suitable disposal is accomplished;
(3) Skid-mounted equipment, portable containers, spools or reels, and drums shall be marked with the owner's name prior to use or transport over offshore waters; and
(4) All markings must clearly identify the owner and must be durable enough to resist the effects of the environmental conditions to which they may be exposed.
(d) Any of the items described in paragraph (c) of this section that are lost overboard shall be recorded on the facility's daily operations report, as appropriate, and reported to the District Manager.
[76 FR 64462, Oct. 18, 2011, as amended at 81 FR 46560, July 15, 2016]
§ 250.301
Inspection of facilities.
Drilling and production facilities shall be inspected daily or at intervals approved or prescribed by the District Manager to determine if pollution is occurring. Necessary maintenance or repairs shall be made immediately. Records of such inspections and repairs shall be maintained at the facility or at a nearby manned facility for 2 years.

# Casing and Cementing Requirements
§ 250.420
What well casing and cementing requirements must I meet?
You must case and cement all wells. Your casing and cementing programs must meet the applicable requirements of this subpart and of subpart G of this part.
(a)
Casing and cementing program requirements.
Your casing and cementing programs must:
(1) Properly control formation pressures and fluids;
(2) Prevent the direct or indirect release of fluids from any stratum through the wellbore into offshore waters;
(3) Prevent communication between separate hydrocarbon-bearing strata;
(4) Protect freshwater aquifers from contamination;
(5) Support unconsolidated sediments;
(6) Provide adequate centralization consistent with the guidelines of API Standard 65—Part 2 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198); and
(7)(i) Include a certification signed by a registered professional engineer that the casing and cementing design is appropriate for the purpose for which it is intended under expected wellbore conditions, and is sufficient to satisfy the tests and requirements of this section and § 250.423. Submit this certification with your APD (Form BSEE-0123).
(ii) You must have the registered professional engineer involved in the casing and cementing design process.
(iii) The registered professional engineer must be registered in a state of the United States and have sufficient expertise and experience to perform the certification.
(b)
Casing requirements.
(1) You must design casing (including liners) to withstand the anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, compressive, and buckling loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal effects; and combinations thereof.
(2) The casing design must include safety measures that ensure well control during drilling and safe operations during the life of the well.
(3) On all wells that use subsea BOP stacks, you must include two independent barriers, including one mechanical barrier, in each annular flow path (examples of barriers include, but are not limited to, primary cement job and seal assembly). For the final casing string (or liner if it is your final string), you must install one mechanical barrier in addition to cement to prevent flow in the event of a failure in the cement. A dual float valve, by
itself, is not considered a mechanical barrier. These barriers cannot be modified prior to or during completion or abandonment operations. The BSEE District Manager may approve alternative options under § 250.141. You must submit documentation of this installation to BSEE in the End-of-Operations Report (Form BSEE-0125).
(4) If you need to substitute a different size, grade, or weight of casing than what was approved in your APD, you must contact the District Manager for approval prior to installing the casing.
(c)
Cementing requirements
. (1) You must design and conduct your cementing jobs so that cement composition, placement techniques, and waiting times ensure that the cement placed behind the bottom 500 feet of casing attains a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling out the casing or before commencing completion operations. (If a liner is used refer to § 250.421(f)).
(2) You must use a weighted fluid during displacement to maintain an overbalanced hydrostatic pressure during the cement setting time, except when cementing casings or liners in riserless hole sections.
[76 FR 64462, Oct. 18, 2011, as amended at 77 FR 50892, Aug. 22, 2012; 81 FR 26018, Apr. 29, 2016; 84 FR 21973, May 15, 2019]
§ 250.421
What are the casing and cementing requirements by type of casing string?
The table in this section identifies specific design, setting, and cementing requirements for casing strings and liners. For the purposes of subpart D, the casing strings in order of normal installation are as follows: drive or structural, conductor, surface, intermediate, and production casings (including liners). The District Manager may approve or prescribe other casing and cementing requirements where appropriate.
Casing type
Casing requirements
Cementing requirements
(a) Drive or Structural
Set by driving, jetting, or drilling to the minimum depth as approved or prescribed by the District Manager
If you drilled a portion of this hole, you must use enough cement to fill the annular space back to the mudline.
(b) Conductor
Design casing and select setting depths based on relevant engineering and geologic factors. These factors include the presence or absence of hydrocarbons, potential hazards, and water depths
Set casing immediately before drilling into formations known to contain oil or gas. If you encounter oil or gas or unexpected formation pressure before the planned casing point, you must set casing immediately and set it above the encountered zone
Use enough cement to fill the calculated annular space back to the mudline.
Verify annular fill by observing cement returns. If you cannot observe cement returns, use additional cement to ensure fill-back to the mudline.
For drilling on an artificial island or when using a well cellar, you must discuss the cement fill level with the District Manager.
(c) Surface
Design casing and select setting depths based on relevant engineering and geologic factors. These factors include the presence or absence of hydrocarbons, potential hazards, and water depths
Use enough cement to fill the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet measured depth (MD) inside the conductor casing.
When geologic conditions such as near-surface fractures and faulting exist, you must use enough cement to fill the calculated annular space to the mudline.
(d) Intermediate
Design casing and select setting depth based on anticipated or encountered geologic characteristics or wellbore conditions
Use enough cement to cover and isolate all hydrocarbon-bearing zones and isolate abnormal pressure intervals from normal pressure intervals in the well.
As a minimum, you must cement the annular space 500 feet MD above the casing shoe and 500 feet MD above each zone to be isolated.
(e) Production
Design casing and select setting depth based on anticipated or encountered geologic characteristics or wellbore conditions
Use enough cement to cover or isolate all hydrocarbon-bearing zones above the shoe.
As a minimum, you must cement the annular space at least 500 feet MD above the casing shoe and 500 feet MD above the uppermost hydrocarbon-bearing zone.
(f) Liners
If you use a liner as surface casing, you must set the top of the liner at least 200 feet MD above the previous casing/liner shoe
If you use a liner as an intermediate string below a surface string or production casing below an intermediate string, you must set the top of the liner at least 100 feet MD above the previous casing shoe.
You may not use a liner as conductor casing.
A subsea well casing string whose top is above the mudline and that has been cemented back to the mudline will not be considered a liner.
Same as cementing requirements for specific casing types. For example, a liner used as intermediate casing must be cemented according to the cementing requirements for intermediate casing.
[76 FR 64462, Oct. 18, 2011, as amended at 81 FR 26018, Apr. 29, 2016; 84 FR 21974, May 15, 2019]
§ 250.422
When may I resume drilling after cementing?
(a) After cementing surface, intermediate, or production casing (or liners), you may resume drilling after the cement has been held under pressure for 12 hours. For conductor casing, you may resume drilling after the cement has been held under pressure for 8 hours. One acceptable method of holding cement under pressure is to use float valves to hold the cement in place.
(b) If you plan to nipple down your diverter or BOP stack during the 8- or 12-hour waiting time, you must determine, before nippling down, when it will be safe to do so. You must base your determination on a knowledge of formation conditions, cement composition, effects of nippling down, presence of potential drilling hazards, well conditions during drilling, cementing, and post cementing, as well as past experience.
§ 250.423
What are the requirements for casing and liner installation?
You must ensure proper installation of casing in the subsea wellhead or liner in the liner hanger.
(a) You must ensure that the latching mechanisms or lock down mechanisms are engaged upon successfully installing the casing string.
(b) If you run a liner that has a latching mechanism or lock down mechanism, you must ensure that the latching mechanisms or lock down mechanisms are engaged upon successfully installing the liner.
(c) You must perform a pressure test on the casing seal assembly to ensure proper installation of casing or liner. You must perform this test for the intermediate and production casing strings or liners.
(1) You must submit for approval with your APD, test procedures and criteria for a successful test.
(2) You must document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request.

§§ 250.424-250.426
[Reserved]
§ 250.427
What are the requirements for pressure integrity tests?
You must conduct a pressure integrity test below the surface casing or liner and all intermediate casings or liners. The District Manager may require you to run a pressure-integrity test at the conductor casing shoe if warranted by local geologic conditions or the planned casing setting depth. You must conduct each pressure integrity test after drilling at least 10 feet but no more than 50 feet of new hole below the casing shoe. You must test to either the formation leak-off pressure or to an equivalent drilling fluid weight if identified in an approved APD.
(a) You must use the pressure integrity test and related hole-behavior observations, such as pore-pressure test results, gas-cut drilling fluid, and well kicks to adjust the drilling fluid program and the setting depth of the next casing string. You must record all test results and hole-behavior observations made during the course of drilling related to formation integrity and pore pressure in the driller's report.
(b) While drilling, you must maintain the safe drilling margin identified in § 250.414. When you cannot maintain the safe drilling margin, you must:
(1) Suspend drilling operations and submit proposed remedial actions to the District Manager. The District Manager must review and approve your proposed remedial actions, which may include limited drilling through a lost circulation zone; or
(2) Notify the District Manager and take further action in accordance with API Bulletin 92L (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198), if appropriate. You must submit a revised permit documenting any responsive actions taken.

# Diverter System Requirements
§ 250.430
When must I install a diverter system?
You must install a diverter system before you drill a conductor or surface hole. The diverter system consists of a diverter sealing element, diverter lines, and control systems. You must design, install, use, maintain, and test the diverter system to ensure proper diversion of gases, water, drilling fluid, and other materials away from facilities and personnel.
§ 250.431
What are the diverter design and installation requirements?
You must design and install your diverter system to:
(a) Use diverter spool outlets and diverter lines that have a nominal diameter of at least 10 inches for surface wellhead configurations and at least 12 inches for floating drilling operations;

(a) Use flexible hose for diverter lines instead of rigid pipe,
Use flexible hose that has integral end couplings.
(b) Use only one spool outlet for your diverter system,
(1) Have branch lines that meet the minimum internal diameter requirements; and (2) Provide downwind diversion capability.
(c) Use a spool with an outlet with an internal diameter of less than 10 inches on a surface wellhead,
Use a spool that has dual outlets with an internal diameter of at least 8 inches.
(d) Use a single diverter line for floating drilling operations on a dynamically positioned drillship,
Maintain an appropriate vessel heading to provide for downwind diversion.
§ 250.433
What are the diverter actuation and testing requirements?
When you install the diverter system, you must actuate the diverter sealing element, diverter valves, and diverter-control systems and control stations. You must also flow-test the vent lines.
(a) For drilling operations with a surface wellhead configuration, you must actuate the diverter system at least once every 24-hour period after the initial test. After you have nippled up on conductor casing, you must pressure-test the diverter-sealing element and diverter valves to a minimum of 200 psi. While the diverter is installed, you must conduct subsequent pressure tests within 7 days after the previous test.
(b) For floating drilling operations with a subsea BOP stack, you must actuate the diverter system within 7 days after the previous actuation. For subsequent testing, you may partially actuate the diverter element and a flow test is not required.
(c) You must alternate actuations and tests between control stations.

# Drilling Fluid Requirements
§ 250.455
What are the general requirements for a drilling fluid program?
You must design and implement your drilling fluid program to prevent the loss of well control. This program must address drilling fluid safe practices, testing and monitoring equipment, drilling fluid quantities, and drilling fluid-handling areas.
§ 250.456
What safe practices must the drilling fluid program follow?
Your drilling fluid program must include the following safe practices:
(a) Before starting out of the hole with drill pipe, you must properly condition the drilling fluid. You must circulate a volume of drilling fluid equal to the annular volume with the drill pipe just off-bottom. You may omit
this practice if documentation in the driller's report shows:
(1) No indication of formation fluid influx before starting to pull the drill pipe from the hole;
(2) The weight of returning drilling fluid is within 0.2 pounds per gallon (1.5 pounds per cubic foot) of the drilling fluid entering the hole; and
(3) Other drilling fluid properties are within the limits established by the program approved in the APD.
(b) Record each time you circulate drilling fluid in the hole in the driller's report;
(c) When coming out of the hole with drill pipe, you must fill the annulus with drilling fluid before the hydrostatic pressure decreases by 75 psi, or every five stands of drill pipe, whichever gives a lower decrease in hydrostatic pressure. You must calculate the number of stands of drill pipe and drill collars that you may pull before you must fill the hole. You must also calculate the equivalent drilling fluid volume needed to fill the hole. Both sets of numbers must be posted near the driller's station. You must use a mechanical, volumetric, or electronic device to measure the drilling fluid required to fill the hole;
(d) You must run and pull drill pipe and downhole tools at controlled rates so you do not swab or surge the well;
(e) When there is an indication of swabbing or influx of formation fluids, you must take appropriate measures to control the well. You must circulate and condition the well, on or near-bottom, unless well or drilling-fluid conditions prevent running the drill pipe back to the bottom;
(f) You must calculate and post near the driller's console the maximum pressures that you may safely contain under a shut-in BOP for each casing string. The pressures posted must consider the surface pressure at which the formation at the shoe would break down, the rated working pressure of the BOP stack, and 70 percent of casing burst (or casing test as approved by the District Manager). As a minimum, you must post the following two pressures:
(1) The surface pressure at which the shoe would break down. This calculation must consider the current drilling fluid weight in the hole; and
(2) The lesser of the BOP's rated working pressure or 70 percent of casing-burst pressure (or casing test otherwise approved by the District Manager);
(g) You must install an operable drilling fluid-gas separator and degasser before you begin drilling operations. You must maintain this equipment throughout the drilling of the well;
(h) Before pulling drill-stem test tools from the hole, you must circulate or reverse-circulate the test fluids in the hole. If circulating out test fluids is not feasible, you may bullhead test fluids out of the drill-stem test string and tools with an appropriate kill weight fluid;
(i) When circulating, you must test the drilling fluid at least once each tour, or more frequently if conditions warrant. Your tests must conform to industry-accepted practices and include density, viscosity, and gel strength; hydrogenion concentration; filtration; and any other tests the District Manager requires for monitoring and maintaining drilling fluid quality, prevention of downhole equipment problems and for kick detection. You must record the results of these tests in the drilling fluid report; and
(j) In areas where permafrost and/or hydrate zones are present or may be present, you must control drilling fluid temperatures to drill safely through those zones.
[76 FR 64462, Oct. 18, 2011, as amended at 77 FR 50894, Aug. 22, 2012; 81 FR 26020, Apr. 29, 2016]
§ 250.457
What equipment is required to monitor drilling fluids?
Once you establish drilling fluid returns, you must install and maintain the following drilling fluid-system monitoring equipment throughout subsequent drilling operations. This equipment must have the following indicators on the rig floor:
(a) Pit level indicator to determine drilling fluid-pit volume gains and losses. This indicator must include both a visual and an audible warning device;
(b) Volume measuring device to accurately determine drilling fluid volumes required to fill the hole on trips;
(c) Return indicator devices that indicate the relationship between drilling fluid-return flow rate and pump discharge rate. This indicator must include both a visual and an audible warning device; and
(d) Gas-detecting equipment to monitor the drilling fluid returns. The indicator may be located in the drilling fluid-logging compartment or on the rig floor. If the indicators are only in the logging compartment, you must continually man the equipment and have a means of immediate communication with the rig floor. If the indicators are on the rig floor only, you must install an audible alarm.
§ 250.458
What quantities of drilling fluids are required?
(a) You must use, maintain, and replenish quantities of drilling fluid and drilling fluid materials at the drill site as necessary to ensure well control. You must determine those quantities based on known or anticipated drilling conditions, rig storage capacity, weather conditions, and estimated time for delivery.
(b) You must record the daily inventories of drilling fluid and drilling fluid materials, including weight materials and additives in the drilling fluid report.
(c) If you do not have sufficient quantities of drilling fluid and drilling fluid material to maintain well control, you must suspend drilling operations.
§ 250.459
What are the safety requirements for drilling fluid-handling areas?
You must classify drilling fluid-handling areas according to API RP 500, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities, Classified as Class I, Division 1 and Division 2 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198); or API RP 505, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities, Classified as Class 1, Zone 0, Zone 1, and Zone 2 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198). In areas where dangerous concentrations of combustible gas may accumulate, you must install and maintain a ventilation system and gas monitors. Drilling fluid-handling areas must have the following safety equipment:
(a) A ventilation system capable of replacing the air once every 5 minutes or 1.0 cubic feet of air-volume flow per minute, per square foot of area, whichever is greater. In addition:
(1) If natural means provide adequate ventilation, then a mechanical ventilation system is not necessary;
(2) If a mechanical system does not run continuously, then it must activate when gas detectors indicate the presence of 1 percent or more of combustible gas by volume; and
(3) If discharges from a mechanical ventilation system may be hazardous, then you must maintain the drilling fluid-handling area at a negative pressure. You must protect the negative pressure area by using at least one of the following: a pressure-sensitive alarm, open-door alarms on each access to the area, automatic door-closing devices, air locks, or other devices approved by the District Manager;
(b) Gas detectors and alarms except in open areas where adequate ventilation is provided by natural means. You must test and recalibrate gas detectors quarterly. No more than 90 days may elapse between tests;
(c) Explosion-proof or pressurized electrical equipment to prevent the ignition of explosive gases. Where you use air for pressuring equipment, you must locate the air intake outside of and as far as practicable from hazardous areas; and
(d) Alarms that activate when the mechanical ventilation system fails.

# Other Drilling Requirements

What must I do in the event of a kick?
In the event of a kick, you must
use one of the following alternatives to dispose of the well-influx fluids giving consideration to personnel safety, possible environmental damage, and possible facility well-equipment damage:
(1) Contain the well-fluid influx by shutting in the well and pumping the fluids back into the formation.
(2) Control the kick by using appropriate well-control techniques to prevent formation fracturing in an open hole within the pressure limits of the well equipment (drill pipe, work string, casing, wellhead, BOP system, and related equipment). The disposal of H
2
S and other gases must be through pressurized or atmospheric mud-separator equipment depending on volume, pressure and concentration of H
2
S. The equipment must be designed to recover well-control fluids and burn the gases separated from the well-control fluid. The well-control fluid must be treated to neutralize H
2
S and restore and maintain the proper quality.
(o)

The high pressure test must equal 70 percent of the RWP of the equipment or be 500 psi greater than your calculated MASP, as defined for the operation for the applicable section of hole. Before you may test BOP equipment to the MASP plus 500 psi, the District Manager must have approved those test pressures in your APD or APM.
(c)
Duration of pressure test.
Each test must hold the required pressure for 5 minutes, which must be recorded on a chart not exceeding 4 hours, or on a digital recorder. However, for surface BOP systems and surface equipment of a subsea BOP system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable if recorded on a chart not exceeding 4 hours, or on a digital recorder. The recorded test pressures must be within the middle half of the chart range,
i.e.,

(4) You must receive approval from the District Manager prior to resuming operations.
(c) Need to postpone a BOP test due to well-control problems such as lost circulation, formation fluid influx, or stuck pipe;
Record the reason for postponing the test in the daily report and conduct the required BOP test after the first trip out of the hole.
(d) BOP control station or pod that does not function properly;
Suspend operations until that station or pod is operable. You must report any problems or irregularities, including any leaks, to the District Manager.
(e) Plan to operate with a tapered string;
Install two or more sets of conventional or variable-bore pipe rams in the BOP stack to provide for the following: two sets of rams must be capable of sealing around the larger-size drill string and one set of pipe rams must be capable of sealing around the smaller size pipe, excluding the bottom hole assembly that includes heavy weight pipe or collars and bottom-hole tools.
(f) Plan to install casing rams or casing shear rams in a surface BOP stack;
Before running casing, perform a shell test to the permit approved test pressure of the BOP component above the casing ram/casing shear. If this installation was not included in your approved permit, and changes the BOP configuration approved in the APD or APM, you must notify and receive approval from the District Manager.
(g) Plan to use an annular BOP with a RWP less than the anticipated surface pressure;
Demonstrate that your well-control procedures or the anticipated well conditions will not place demands above its RWP and obtain approval from the District Manager.
(h) Plan to use a subsea BOP system in an ice-scour area;
Install the BOP stack in a well cellar. The well cellar must be deep enough to ensure that the top of the stack is below the deepest probable ice-scour depth.
(i) You activate any shear ram and pipe or casing is sheared;
Retrieve, physically inspect, and conduct a full pressure test of the BOP stack after the situation is fully controlled. You must submit to the District Manager a report from an independent third party certifying that the BOP is fit to return to service.
(j) Need to remove the BOP stack;
Have a minimum of two barriers in place prior to BOP removal. You must obtain approval from the District Manager of the two barriers prior to removal and the District Manager may require additional barriers and test(s).
(k) In the event of a deadman or autoshear activation, if there is a possibility of the blind shear ram opening immediately upon re-establishing power to the BOP stack;
Place the blind shear ram opening function in the block position prior to re-establishing power to the stack. Contact the District Manager and receive approval of procedures for re-establishing power and functions prior to latching up the BOP stack or re-establishing power to the stack.
(l) If a test ram is to be used;
The wellhead/BOP connection must be tested to the MASP plus 500 psi for the hole section to which it is exposed. This can be done by:
(1) Testing wellhead/BOP connection to the MASP plus 500 psi for the well upon installation;
(2) Pressure testing each casing to the MASP plus 500 psi for the next hole section; or
(3) Some combination of paragraphs (l)(1) and (2) of this section.

(o) You install redundant components for well control in your BOP system that are in addition to the required components of this subpart (e.g., pipe/variable bore rams, shear rams, annular preventers, gas bleed lines, and choke/kill side outlets or lines);
Comply with all testing, maintenance, and inspection requirements in this subpart that are applicable to those well-control components. If any redundant component fails a test, you must submit a report from an independent third party that describes the failure and confirms that there is no impact on the BOP that will make it unfit for well-control purposes. You must submit this report to the District Manager and receive approval before resuming operations. The District Manager may require you to provide additional information as needed to clarify or evaluate your report.
(p) Need to position the bottom hole assembly, including heavy-weight pipe or collars, and bottom-hole tools across the BOP for tripping or any other operations.
Ensure that the well is stable prior to positioning the bottom hole assembly across the BOP. You must have, as part of your well-control plan required by § 250.710, procedures that enable the removal of the bottom hole assembly from across the BOP in the event of a well-control or emergency situation (for dynamically positioned rigs, your plan must also include steps for when the EDS must be activated) before MASP conditions are reached as defined for the operation.

§ 250.829
Subsurface safety devices in shut-in wells—subsea trees.
(a) You must equip all new subsea tree completions (perforated but not placed on production) and completions shut-in for a period of 6 months with one of the following:
(1) A pump-through-type tubing plug;
(2) An injection valve capable of preventing backflow; or
(3) A surface-controlled SSSV, provided the surface control has been rendered inoperative. For purposes of this section, a surface-controlled SSSV is considered inoperative if, for a direct hydraulic control system, you have bled the hydraulics from the control line and have isolated it from the hydraulic control pressure. If your controls employ an electro-hydraulic control umbilical and the hydraulic control pressure to the individual well cannot be isolated, a surface-controlled
SSSV is considered inoperative if you perform the following:
(i) Disable the control function of the surface-controlled SSSV within the logic of the programmable logic controller which controls the subsea well;
(ii) Place a pressure alarm high on the control line to the surface-controlled SSSV of the subsea well; and
(iii) Close the USV and at least one other tree valve on the subsea well.
(b) When warranted by conditions, such as unstable bottom conditions, permafrost, hydrate formation, and paraffin problems, the District Manager must approve the setting depth of the subsurface safety device for a shut-in well on a case-by-case basis.
§ 250.830
Subsurface safety devices in injection wells—subsea trees.
You must install a surface-controlled SSSV or an injection valve capable of preventing backflow in all injection wells. This requirement is not applicable if the District Manager determines that the well is incapable of natural flow. You must verify the no-flow condition of the well annually.
§ 250.831
Alteration or disconnection of subsea pipeline or umbilical.
If a necessary alteration or disconnection of the pipeline or umbilical of any subsea well would affect your ability to monitor casing pressure or to test any subsea valves or equipment, you must contact the appropriate District Office at least 48 hours in advance and submit a repair or replacement plan to conduct the required monitoring and testing. You must not alter or disconnect until the repair or replacement plan is approved.

(b) Use a BSDV that is fire rated for 30 minutes, and is pressure rated for the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) approved in your pipeline application.
(c) Locate the BSDV within 10 feet of the first point of access to the boarding pipeline riser (
i.e.,
within 10 feet of the edge of platform if the BSDV is horizontal, or within 10 feet above the first accessible working deck, excluding the boat landing and above the splash zone, if the BSDV is vertical).
(d) Install a temperature safety element (TSE) and locate it within 5 feet of each BSDV.
§ 250.836
Use of BSDVs.
You must install, inspect, maintain, repair, and test all new BSDVs, as well as all BSDVs that you remove from service for remanufacturing or repair, in accordance with API STD 6AV2 (incorporated by reference in § 250.198) for SSVs. If any BSDV does not operate properly or if any gas fluid and/or liquid fluid flow is observed during the leakage test, as described in § 250.880, you must shut-in all sources to the BSDV and immediately repair or replace the valve.

(2) Establish direct, real-time communications between the MODU or other type of workover or intervention vessel and the production facility control room and develop a dropped objects plan, as required in § 250.714. If an object is dropped, you must immediately secure the well directly under the MODU or other type of workover or intervention vessel while simultaneously communicating with the platform to shut-in all affected wells. You must also maintain without disruption, and continuously verify, communication between the production facility and the MODU or other type of workover or intervention vessel. If communication is lost between the MODU or other type of workover or intervention vessel and the platform for 20 or more minutes, you must shut-in all wells that could be affected by a dropped object.
(c) In the event of an emergency, you must operate your production system according to the valve closure times in the applicable tables in §§ 250.838 and 250.839 for the following conditions:
(1)
Process upset.
In the event an upset in the production process train occurs downstream of the BSDV, you must close the BSDV in accordance with the applicable tables in §§ 250.838 and 250.839. You may reopen the BSDV to blow down the pipeline to prevent hydrates, provided you have secured the well(s) and ensured adequate protection.
(2)
Pipeline pressure safety high and low (PSHL) sensor.
In the event that either a high or a low pressure condition is detected by a PSHL sensor located upstream of the BSDV, you must secure the affected well and pipeline, and all wells and pipelines associated with a dual or multi pipeline system, by closing the BSDVs, USVs, and surface-controlled SSSVs in accordance with the applicable tables in §§ 250.838 and 250.839. You must obtain approval from the appropriate District Manager to resume production in the unaffected
pipeline(s) of a dual or multi pipeline system. If the PSHL sensor activation was a false alarm, you may return the wells to production without contacting the appropriate District Manager.
(3)
ESD/TSE (platform).
In the event of an ESD activation that is initiated because of a platform ESD or platform TSE not associated with the BSDV, you must close the BSDV, USV, and surface-controlled SSSV in accordance with the applicable tables in
§§ 250.838 and 250.839.

(vi) Subsurface safety valves, including those that are self-actuated (subsurface-controlled SSSVs) or those that are activated by an ESD system and/or a fire loop (surface-controlled SSSV). You do not have to receive approval from the District Manager for routine operations in accordance with § 250.817;
(vii) The pneumatic supply system; and
(viii) The system for discharging gas to the atmosphere.
(4) In instances where components of the ESD, as listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, are bypassed for maintenance, precautions must be taken to
provide the equivalent level of protection that existed prior to the bypass.
(b) When wells are disconnected from producing facilities and blind flanged, or equipped with a tubing plug, or the master valves have been locked closed, you are not required to comply with the provisions of API RP 14C (incorporated by reference as specified in § 250.198) or this regulation concerning the following:
(1) Automatic fail-close SSVs on wellhead assemblies, and
(2) The PSH and PSL sensors in flowlines from wells.
(c) When pressure or atmospheric vessels are isolated from production facilities (e.g., inlet valve locked closed or inlet blind-flanged) and are to remain isolated for an extended period of time, safety device testing in accordance with API RP 14C (incorporated by reference as specified in § 250.198), or this subpart is not required, with the exception of the PSV, unless the vessel is open to the atmosphere.

§ 250.870
Time delays on pressure safety low (PSL) sensors.
(a) You may apply industry standard Class B, Class C, or Class B/C logic to applicable PSL sensors installed on process equipment. If the device may be bypassed for greater than 45 seconds, you must monitor the bypassed devices in accordance with § 250.869(a). You must document on your field test records any use of a PSL sensor with a time delay greater than 45 seconds. For purposes of this section, PSL sensors are categorized as follows:
(1) Class B safety devices have logic that allows for the PSL sensors to be bypassed for a fixed time period (typically less than 15 seconds, but not more than 45 seconds). Examples include sensors used in conjunction with the design of pump and compressor panels such as PSL sensors, lubricator no-flows, and high-water jacket temperature shutdowns.
(2) Class C safety devices have logic that allows for the PSL sensors to be bypassed until the component comes into full service (
i.e.,
the time at which the startup pressure equals or exceeds the set pressure of the PSL sensor, the system reaches a stabilized pressure, and the PSL sensor clears). If a Class C safety device is bypassed, you must monitor the device until it is in full service.
(3) Class B/C safety devices have logic that allows for the PSL sensors to incorporate a combination of Class B and Class C circuitry. These devices are used to ensure that the PSL sensors are not unnecessarily bypassed during startup and idle operations, (e.g., Class B/C bypass circuitry activates when a pump is shut down during normal operations). The PSL sensor remains bypassed until the pump's start circuitry is activated and either:
(i) The Class B timer expires no later than 45 seconds from start activation, or
(ii) The Class C bypass is initiated until the pump builds up pressure above the PSL sensor set point and the PSL sensor comes into full service.
(b) If you do not install time delay circuitry that bypasses activation of PSL sensor shutdown logic for a specified time period on process and product transport equipment during startup and idle operations, you must manually bypass (pin out or disengage) the PSL sensor, with a time delay not to exceed 45 seconds.

(i) You must adhere to the requirements of this subpart, including the industry standards in § 250.901.
(ii) If you are installing a floating platform, you must also adhere to U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) regulations for the fabrication, installation, and inspection of floating OCS facilities.
(2) Major modification to any platform. This includes any structural changes that materially alter the approved plan or cause a major deviation from approved operations and any modification that increases loading on a platform by 10 percent or more
(i) You must adhere to the requirements of this subpart, including the industry standards in § 250.901.
(ii) Before you make a major modification to a floating platform, you must obtain approval from both the BSEE and the USCG for the modification.
(3) Major repair of damage to any platform. This includes any corrective operations involving structural members affecting the structural integrity of a portion or all of the platform
(i) You must adhere to the requirements of this subpart, including the industry standards in § 250.901.
(ii) Before you make a major repair to a floating platform, you must obtain approval from both the BSEE and the USCG for the repair.
(4) Convert an existing platform at the current location for a new purpose
(i) The Regional Supervisor will determine on a case-by-case basis the requirements for an application for conversion of an existing platform at the current location.
(ii) At a minimum, your application must include: the converted platform's intended use; and a demonstration of the adequacy of the design and structural condition of the converted platform.
(iii) If a floating platform, you must also adhere to USCG regulations for the fabrication, installation, and inspection of floating OCS facilities.
(5) Convert an existing mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) for a new purpose
(i) The Regional Supervisor will determine on a case-by-case basis the requirements for an application for conversion of an existing MODU.
(ii) At a minimum, your application must include: the converted MODU's intended location and use; a demonstration of the adequacy of the design and structural condition of the converted MODU; and a demonstration that the level of safety for the converted MODU is at least equal to that of re-used platforms.
(iii) You must also adhere to USCG regulations for the fabrication, installation, and inspection of floating OCS facilities.
(c) Under emergency conditions, you may make repairs to primary structural elements to restore an existing permitted condition without submitting an application or receiving prior BSEE approval for up to 120-calendar days following an event. You must notify the Regional Supervisor of the damage that occurred within 24 hours of its discovery, and you must provide a written completion report to the Regional Supervisor of the repairs that were made within 1 week after completing the repairs. If you make emergency repairs on a floating platform, you must also notify the USCG.
(d) You must determine if your new platform or major modification to an existing platform is subject to the Platform Verification Program (PVP). Section 250.910 of this subpart fully describes the facilities that are subject to the PVP.

Depending upon the design and location of your proposed platform and the results of the shallow hazard and geologic surveys, the Regional Supervisor may require you to perform a subsurface survey. This survey will include a testing program for investigating the stratigraphic and engineering properties of the soil that may affect the foundations or anchoring systems for your facility. The testing program must include adequate in situ testing, boring, and sampling to examine all important soil and rock strata to determine its strength classification, deformation properties, and dynamic characteristics. If required to perform a subsurface survey, you must prepare and submit to the Regional Supervisor a summary report to briefly describe the results of your soil testing program, the various field and laboratory test methods employed, and the applicability of these methods as they pertain to the quality of the samples, the type of soil, and the anticipated design application. You must explain how the engineering properties of each soil stratum affect the design of your platform. In your explanation you must describe the uncertainties inherent in your overall testing program, and the reliability and applicability of each test method.
(d)
Overall site investigation report.
You must prepare and submit to the Regional Supervisor an overall site investigation report for your platform that integrates the findings of your shallow hazards surveys and geologic surveys, and, if required, your subsurface surveys. Your overall site investigation report must include analyses of the potential for:
(1) Scouring of the seafloor;
(2) Hydraulic instability;
(3) The occurrence of sand waves;
(4) Instability of slopes at the platform location;
(5) Liquefaction, or possible reduction of soil strength due to increased pore pressures;

§ 250.907
Where must I locate foundation boreholes?
(a) For fixed or bottom-founded platforms and tension leg platforms, your maximum distance from any foundation pile to a soil boring must not exceed 500 feet.
(b) For deepwater floating platforms which utilize catenary or taut-leg moorings, you must take borings at the most heavily loaded anchor location, at the anchor points approximately 120 and 240 degrees around the anchor pattern from that boring, and, as necessary, other points throughout the anchor pattern to establish the soil profile suitable for foundation design purposes.
§ 250.908
What are the minimum structural fatigue design requirements?
(a) API RP 2A-WSD, Recommended Practice for Planning, Designing and Constructing Fixed Offshore Platforms (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198), requires that the design fatigue life of each joint and member be twice the intended service life of the structure. When designing your platform, the following table provides minimum fatigue life safety factors for critical structural members and joints.
If . . .
Then . . .
(1) There is sufficient structural redundancy to prevent catastrophic failure of the platform or structure under consideration,
The results of the fatigue analysis must indicate a minimum calculated life of twice the design life of the platform.
(2) There is not sufficient structural redundancy to prevent catastrophic failure of the platform or structure,
The results of a fatigue analysis must indicate a minimum calculated life or three times the design life of the platform.
(3) The desirable degree of redundancy is significantly reduced as a result of fatigue damage,
The results of a fatigue analysis must indicate a minimum calculated life of three times the design life of the platform.
(b) The documents incorporated by reference in § 250.901 may require larger safety factors than indicated in paragraph (a) of this section for some key components. When the documents incorporated by reference require a larger safety factor than the chart in paragraph (a) of this section, the requirements of the incorporated document will prevail.

# Platform Verification Program
§ 250.909
What is the Platform Verification Program?
The Platform Verification Program is the BSEE approval process for ensuring that floating platforms; platforms of a new or unique design; platforms in seismic areas; or platforms located in deepwater or frontier areas meet stringent requirements for design and construction. The program is applied during construction of new platforms and major modifications of, or repairs to, existing platforms. These requirements are in addition to the requirements of
the Platform Approval Program described in §§ 250.904 through 250.908 of this subpart.
§ 250.910
Which of my facilities are subject to the Platform Verification Program?
(a) All new fixed or bottom-founded platforms that meet any of the following five conditions are subject to the Platform Verification Program:
(1) Platforms installed in water depths exceeding 400 feet (122 meters);
(2) Platforms having natural periods in excess of 3 seconds;
(3) Platforms installed in areas of unstable bottom conditions;
(4) Platforms having configurations and designs which have not previously been used or proven for use in the area; or
(5) Platforms installed in seismically active areas.
(b) All new floating platforms are subject to the Platform Verification Program to the extent indicated in the following table:
If . . .
Then . . .
(1) Your new floating platform is a buoyant offshore facility that does not have a ship-shaped hull,
The entire platform is subject to the Platform Verification Program including the following associated structures:
(i) Drilling, production, and pipeline risers, and riser tensioning systems (each platform must be designed to accommodate all the loads imposed by all risers and riser does not have tensioning systems);
(ii) Turrets and turret-and-hull interfaces;
(iii) Foundations, foundation pilings and templates, and anchoring systems; and
(iv) Mooring or tethering systems.
(2) Your new floating platform is a buoyant offshore facility with a ship-shaped hull,
Only the following structures that may be associated with a floating platform are subject to the Platform Verification Program:
(i) Drilling, production, and pipeline risers, and riser tensioning systems (each platform must be designed to accommodate all the loads imposed by all risers and riser tensioning systems);
(ii) Turrets and turret-and-hull interfaces;
(iii) Foundations, foundation pilings and templates, and anchoring systems; and
(iv) Mooring or tethering systems.
(c) If a platform is originally subject to the Platform Verification Program, then the conversion of that platform at that same site for a new purpose, or making a major modification of, or major repair to, that platform, is also subject to the Platform Verification Program. A major modification includes any modification that increases loading on a platform by 10 percent or more. A major repair is a corrective operation involving structural members affecting the structural integrity of a portion or all of the platform. Before you make a major modification or repair to a floating platform, you must obtain approval from both the BSEE and the USCG.

You may not exceed 48 cumulative hours of flaring or venting per unloading or cleaning or testing operation on a single completion without Regional Supervisor approval.
(5) When properly working equipment yields flash gas (natural gas released from liquid hydrocarbons as a result of a decrease in pressure, an increase in temperature, or both) from storage vessels or other low-pressure production vessels, and you cannot economically recover this flash gas
You may not flare or vent more than an average of 50 MCF per day during any calendar month without Regional Supervisor approval.
(6) When the equipment works properly but there is a temporary upset condition, such as a hydrate or paraffin plug
(i) For oil-well gas and gas-well flash gas (natural gas released from condensate as a result of a decrease in pressure, an increase in temperature, or both), you may not exceed 48 continuous hours of flaring or venting without Regional Supervisor approval.
(ii) For primary gas-well gas (natural gas from a gas well completion that is at or near its wellhead pressure; this does not include flash gas), you may not exceed 2 continuous hours of flaring or venting without Regional Supervisor approval.
(iii) You may not exceed 144 cumulative hours of flaring or venting during a calendar month without Regional Supervisor approval.
(7) When equipment fails to work properly, during equipment maintenance and repair, or when you must relieve system pressures
(i) For oil-well gas and gas-well flash gas, you may not exceed 48 continuous hours of flaring or venting without Regional Supervisor approval.
(ii) For primary gas-well gas, you may not exceed 2 continuous hours of flaring or venting without Regional Supervisor approval.
(iii) You may not exceed 144 cumulative hours of flaring or venting during a calendar month without Regional Supervisor approval.
(iv) The continuous and cumulative hours allowed under this paragraph may be counted separately from the hours under paragraph (a)(6) of this section.

§ 250.1161
When may I flare or vent gas for extended periods of time?
You must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor to flare or vent gas for an extended period of time. The Regional Supervisor will specify the approved period of time, which will not exceed 1 year. The Regional Supervisor may deny your request if it does not ensure the conservation of natural resources or is not consistent with National interests relating to development and production of minerals of the OCS. The Regional Supervisor may approve your request for one of the following reasons:
(a) You initiated an action which, when completed, will eliminate flaring and venting; or
(b) You submit to the Regional Supervisor an evaluation supported by engineering, geologic, and economic data indicating that the oil and gas produced from the well(s) will not economically support the facilities necessary to sell the gas or to use the gas on or for the benefit of the lease.
§ 250.1162
When may I burn produced liquid hydrocarbons?
(a) You must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor to burn any produced liquid hydrocarbons. The Regional Supervisor may allow you to burn liquid hydrocarbons if you demonstrate that transporting them to market or re-injecting them is not technically feasible or poses a significant risk of harm to offshore personnel or the environment.
(b) If you burn liquid hydrocarbons without the required approval, or if the Regional Supervisor determines that you were negligent or could have avoided burning liquid hydrocarbons, the hydrocarbons will be considered avoidably lost or wasted. You must pay royalties on the loss or waste, according to 30 CFR part 1202. You must value any liquid hydrocarbons avoidably lost or wasted under the provisions of 30 CFR part 1206.

# Subpart M—Unitization
§ 250.1300
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart explains how Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases are unitized. If you are an OCS lessee, use the regulations in this subpart for both competitive reservoir and unitization situations. The purpose of joint development and unitization is to:
(a) Conserve natural resources;
(b) Prevent waste; and/or
(c) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests.
§ 250.1301
What are the requirements for unitization?
(a)
Voluntary unitization.
You and other OCS lessees may ask the Regional Supervisor to approve a request for voluntary unitization. The Regional Supervisor may approve the request for voluntary unitization if unitized operations:
(1) Promote and expedite exploration and development; or
(2) Prevent waste, conserve natural resources, or protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, of a reasonably delineated and productive reservoir.
(b)
Compulsory unitization.
The Regional Supervisor may require you and other lessees to unitize operations of a reasonably delineated and productive reservoir if unitized operations are necessary to:
(1) Prevent waste;
(2) Conserve natural resources; or
(3) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests.
(c)
Unit area.
The area that a unit includes is the minimum number of leases that will allow the lessees to minimize the number of platforms, facility installations, and wells necessary for efficient exploration, development, and production of mineral deposits, oil and gas reservoirs, or potential hydrocarbon accumulations common to two or more leases. A unit may include whole leases or portions of leases.
(d)
Unit agreement.
You, the other lessees, and the unit operator must enter into a unit agreement. The unit agreement must: allocate benefits to unitized leases, designate a unit operator, and specify the effective date of the unit agreement. The unit agreement must terminate when: the unit no longer produces unitized substances, and the unit operator no longer conducts drilling or well-workover operations (§ 250.180) under the unit agreement, unless the Regional Supervisor orders or approves a suspension of production under § 250.170.
(e)
Unit operating agreement.
The unit operator and the owners of working interests in the unitized leases must enter into a unit operating agreement. The unit operating agreement must describe how all the unit participants will apportion all costs and liabilities incurred maintaining or conducting operations. When a unit involves one or more net-profit-share leases, the unit operating agreement must describe how to attribute costs and credits to the net-profit-share lease(s), and this part of the agreement must be approved by the Regional Supervisor. Otherwise, you must provide a copy of the unit operating agreement to the Regional Supervisor, but the Regional Supervisor does not need to approve the unit operating agreement.
(f)
Extension of a lease covered by unit operations.
If your unit agreement expires or terminates, or the unit area adjusts so that no part of your lease remains within the unit boundaries, your lease expires unless:
(1) Its initial term has not expired;
(2) You conduct drilling, production, or well-reworking operations on your lease consistent with applicable regulations; or
(3) BSEE orders or approves a suspension of production or operations for your lease.
(g)
Unit operations.
If your lease, or any part of your lease, is subject to a unit agreement, the entire lease continues for the term provided in the lease, and as long thereafter as any portion of your lease remains part of the unit area, and as long as operations continue the unit in effect.
(1) If you drill, produce or perform well-workover operations on a lease within a unit, each lease, or part of a lease, in the unit will remain active in accordance with the unit agreement. Following a discovery, if your unit ceases drilling activities for a reasonable time period between the delineation of one or more reservoirs and the initiation of actual development drilling or production operations and that time period would extend beyond your lease's primary term or any extension under § 250.180, the unit operator must request and obtain BSEE approval of a suspension of production under § 250.170 in order to keep the unit from terminating.
(2) When a lease in a unit agreement is beyond the primary term and the lease or unit is not producing, the lease will expire unless:
(i) You conduct a continuous drilling or well reworking program designed to develop or restore the lease or unit production; or
(ii) BSEE orders or approves a suspension of operations under § 250.170.
§ 250.1302
What if I have a competitive reservoir on a lease?
(a) The Regional Supervisor may require you to conduct development and production operations in a competitive reservoir under either a joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program submitted to BSEE or a unitization agreement. A competitive reservoir has one or more producing or producible well completions on each of two or more leases, or portions of leases, with different lease operating interests. For purposes of this paragraph, a producible well completion is a well which is capable of production and which is shut in at the well head or at the surface
but not necessarily connected to production facilities and from which the operator plans future production.
(b) You may request that the Regional Supervisor make a preliminary determination whether a reservoir is competitive. When you receive the preliminary determination, you have 30 days (or longer if the Regional Supervisor allows additional time) to concur or to submit an objection with supporting evidence if you do not concur. The Regional Supervisor will make a final determination and notify you and the other lessees.
(c) If you conduct drilling or production operations in a reservoir determined competitive by the BSEE Regional Supervisor, you and the other affected lessees must submit for approval a joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program. You must submit the joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program within 90 days after the Regional Supervisor makes a final determination that the reservoir is competitive. The joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program must provide for the development and/or production of the reservoir. You may submit supplemental Competitive Reservoir Development Programs for the Regional Supervisor's approval.
(d) If you and the other affected lessees cannot reach an agreement on a joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program, submitted to BSEE within the approved period of time, each lessee must submit a separate Competitive Reservoir Development Program to the Regional Supervisor. The Regional Supervisor will hold a hearing to resolve differences in the separate Competitive Reservoir Development Programs. If the differences in the separate programs are not resolved at the hearing and the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization is necessary under § 250.1301(b), BSEE will initiate unitization under § 250.1304.

(3) Supporting geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and
(4) Other information that may be necessary to show that the unitization proposal meets the criteria of § 250.1300.
(b) The unit agreement must comply with the requirements of this part. BSEE will maintain and provide a model unit agreement for you to follow. If BSEE revises the model, BSEE will publish the revised model in the
Federal Register.
If you vary your unit agreement from the model agreement, you must obtain the approval of the Regional Supervisor.
(c) After the Regional Supervisor accepts your unitization proposal, you, the other lessees, and the unit operator must sign and file copies of the unit agreement, the unit operating agreement, and the initial plan of operation with the Regional Supervisor for approval.
(d) You must pay the service fee listed in § 250.125 of this part with your request for a voluntary unitization proposal or the expansion of a previously approved voluntary unit to include additional acreage. Additionally, you must pay the service fee listed in § 250.125 with your request for unitization revision.
§ 250.1304
How will BSEE require unitization?
(a) If the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization of operations within a proposed unit area is necessary to prevent waste, conserve natural resources of the OCS, or protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, the Regional Supervisor may require unitization.
(b) If you ask BSEE to require unitization, you must file a request with the Regional Supervisor. You must include a proposed unit agreement as described in §§ 250.1301(d) and 250.1303(b); a proposed unit operating agreement; a proposed initial plan of operation; supporting geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and any other information that may be necessary to show that unitization meets the criteria of § 250.1300. The proposed unit agreement
must include a counterpart executed by each lessee seeking compulsory unitization. Lessees who seek compulsory unitization must simultaneously serve on the nonconsenting lessees copies of:
(1) The request;
(2) The proposed unit agreement with executed counterparts;
(3) The proposed unit operating agreement; and
(4) The proposed initial plan of operation.
(c) If the Regional Supervisor initiates compulsory unitization, BSEE will serve all lessees of the proposed unit area with a proposed unitization plan and a statement of reasons for the proposed unitization.
(d) The Regional Supervisor will not require unitization until BSEE provides all lessees of the proposed unit area written notice and an opportunity for a hearing. If you want BSEE to hold a hearing, you must request it within 30 days after you receive written notice from the Regional Supervisor or after you are served with a request for compulsory unitization from another lessee.
(e) BSEE will not hold a hearing under this paragraph until at least 30 days after BSEE provides written notice of the hearing date to all parties owning interests that would be made subject to the unit agreement. The Regional Supervisor must give all lessees of the proposed unit area an opportunity to submit views orally and in writing and to question both those seeking and those opposing compulsory unitization. Adjudicatory procedures are not required. The Regional Supervisor will make a decision based upon a record of the hearing, including any written information made a part of the record. The Regional Supervisor will arrange for a court reporter to make a verbatim transcript. The party seeking compulsory unitization must pay for the court reporter and pay for and provide to the Regional Supervisor within 10 days after the hearing three copies of the verbatim transcript.
(f) The Regional Supervisor will issue an order that requires or rejects compulsory unitization. That order must include a statement of reasons for the action taken and identify those parts of the record which form the basis of the decision. Any adversely affected party may appeal the final order of the Regional Supervisor under 30 CFR part 290.

Directional surveys giving both inclination and azimuth shall be obtained on all directionally drilled wells at intervals not exceeding 500 feet during the normal course of drilling and at intervals not exceeding 200 feet in all planned angle-change portions of the borehole.
(3) Directional surveys giving both inclination and azimuth shall be obtained on both vertically and directionally drilled wells at intervals not exceeding 500 feet prior to or upon setting a string of casing, or production liner, and at total depth. Composite directional surveys shall be prepared with the interval shown from the bottom of the conductor casing. In calculating all surveys, a correction from the true north to Universal-Transverse-Mercator-Grid-north or Lambert-Grid-north shall be made after making the magnetic-to-true-north correction. A composite dipmeter directional survey or a composite measurement while-drilling directional survey will be acceptable as fulfilling the applicable requirements of this paragraph.
(4) Wells are classified as vertical if the calculated average of inclination readings weighted by the respective interval lengths between readings from surface to drilled depth does not exceed 3 degrees from the vertical. When the calculated average inclination readings weighted by the length of the respective interval between readings from the surface to drilled depth exceeds 3 degrees, the well is classified as directional.
(5) At the request of a holder of an adjoining lease, the Regional Supervisor may, for the protection of correlative rights, furnish a copy of the directional survey to that leaseholder.
(f)
Fixed drilling platforms.
Applications for installation of fixed drilling platforms or structures including artificial islands shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of subpart I, Platforms and Structures, of this part.

The lessee shall utilize personnel who are trained and competent and shall utilize and maintain equipment and materials necessary to assure the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment.
§ 250.1607
Field rules.
When geological and engineering information in a field enables a District Manager to determine specific operating requirements, field rules may be established for drilling, well completion, or well workover on the District Manager's initiative or in response to a request from a lessee; such rules may modify the specific requirements of this subpart. After field rules have been established, operations in the field shall be conducted in accordance with such rules and other requirements of this subpart. Field rules may be amended or canceled for cause at any time upon the initiative of the District Manager or upon the request of a lessee.
§ 250.1608
Well casing and cementing.
(a)
General requirements.
(1) For the purpose of this subpart, the several casing strings in order of normal installation are:
(i) Drive or structural,
(ii) Conductor,
(iii) Cap rock casing,
(iv) Bobtail cap rock casing (required when the cap rock casing does not penetrate into the cap rock),
(v) Second cap rock casing (brine wells), and
(vi) Production liner.
(2) The lessee shall case and cement all wells with a sufficient number of strings of casing cemented in a manner necessary to prevent release of fluids from any stratum through the wellbore (directly or indirectly) into the sea, protect freshwater aquifers from contamination, support unconsolidated sediments, and otherwise provide a means of control of the formation pressures and fluids. Cement composition, placement techniques, and waiting time shall be designed and conducted so that the cement in place behind the bottom 500 feet of casing or total length of annular cement fill, if less, attains a minimum compressive strength of 160 pounds per square inch (psi).
(3) The lessee shall install casing designed to withstand the anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, compressive, and buckling loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal effects; and combinations thereof. Safety factors in the drilling and casing program designs shall be of sufficient magnitude to provide well control during drilling and to assure safe operations for the life of the well.
(4) In cases where cement has filled the annular space back to the mud line, the cement may be washed out or displaced to a depth not exceeding the depth of the structural casing shoe to facilitate casing removal upon well
abandonment if the District Manager determines that subsurface protection against damage to freshwater aquifers and against damage caused by adverse loads, pressures, and fluid flows is not jeopardized.
(5) If there are indications of inadequate cementing (such as lost returns, cement channeling, or mechanical failure of equipment), the lessee shall evaluate the adequacy of the cementing operations by pressure testing the casing shoe. If the test indicates inadequate cementing, the lessee shall initiate remedial action as approved by the District Manager. For cap rock casing, the test for adequacy of cementing shall be the pressure testing of the annulus between the cap rock and the conductor casings. The pressure shall not exceed 70 percent of the burst pressure of the conductor casing or 70 percent of the collapse pressure of the cap rock casing.
(b)
Drive or structural casing.
This casing shall be set by driving, jetting, or drilling to a minimum depth of 100 feet below the mud line or such other depth, as may be required or approved by the District Manager, in order to support unconsolidated deposits and to provide hole stability for initial drilling operations. If this portion of the hole is drilled, a quantity of cement sufficient to fill the annular space back to the mud line shall be used.
(c)
Conductor and cap rock casing setting and cementing requirements.
(1) Conductor and cap rock casing design and setting depths shall be based upon relevant engineering and geologic factors including the presence or absence of hydrocarbons, potential hazards, and water depths. The proposed casing setting depths may be varied, subject to District Manager approval, to permit the casing to be set in a competent formation or through formations determined desirable to be isolated from the wellbore by casing for safer drilling operations. However, the conductor casing shall be set immediately prior to drilling into formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon encountering such formations. Cap rock casing shall be set and cemented through formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon encountering such formations. Upon encountering unexpected formation pressures, the lessee shall submit a revised casing program to the District Manager for approval.
(2) Conductor casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space back to the mud line. Cement fill shall be verified by the observation of cement returns. In the event that observation of cement returns is not feasible, additional quantities of cement shall be used to assure fill to the mud line.
(3) Cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet inside the conductor casing. When geologic conditions such as near surface fractures and faulting exist, cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space to the mud line, unless otherwise approved by the District Manager. In brine wells, the second cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet above the setting depth of the first cap rock casing.
(d)
Bobtail cap rock casing setting and cementing requirements.
(1) Bobtail cap rock casing shall be set on or just in cap rock and lapped a minimum of 100 feet into the previous casing string.
(2) Sufficient cement shall be used to fill the annular space to the top of the bobtail cap rock casing.
(e)
Production liner setting and cementing requirements.
(1) Production liners for sulphur wells and bleedwells shall be set in cap rock at or above the bottom of the open hole (hole that is open in cap rock, below the bottom of the cap rock casing) and lapped into the previous casing string or to the surface. For brine wells, the liner shall be set in salt and lapped into the previous casing string or to the surface.
(2) The production liner is not required to be cemented unless the cap rock contains oil or gas. If the cap rock contains oil or gas, sufficient cement shall be used to fill the annular space to the top of the production liner.
§ 250.1609
Pressure testing of casing.
(a) Prior to drilling the plug after cementing, all casing strings, except the drive or structural casing, shall be
pressure tested. The conductor casing shall be tested to at least 200 psi. All casing strings below the conductor casing shall be tested to 500 psi or 0.22 psi/ft, whichever is greater. (When oil or gas is not present in the cap rock, the production liner need not be cemented in place; thus, it would not be subject to pressure testing.) If the pressure declines more than 10 percent in 30 minutes or if there is another indication of a leak, the casing shall be recemented, repaired, or an additional casing string run and the casing tested again. The above procedures shall be repeated until a satisfactory test is obtained. The time, conditions of testing, and results of all casing pressure tests shall be recorded in the driller's report.
(b) After cementing any string of casing other than structural, drilling shall not be resumed until there has been a time lapse of at least 8 hours under pressure for the conductor casing string or 12 hours under pressure for all other casing strings. Cement is considered under pressure if one or more float valves are shown to be holding the cement in place or when other means of holding pressure are used.
