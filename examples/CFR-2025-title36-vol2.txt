# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

[41 FR 24350, June 16, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 32230, June 24, 1977; 43 FR 27190, June 23, 1978; 44 FR 5660, Jan. 29, 1979; 62 FR 33366, June 19, 1997]
§ 200.2
Field organization.
The field organization of the Forest Service consists of regions, stations, and areas as described below:
(a)
Regions of the National Forest System.
For the purpose of managing the lands administered by the Forest Service, the United States is divided into nine geographic regions of the National Forest System. Each region has a headquarters office and is supervised by a Regional Forester who is responsible to the Chief for the activities assigned to that region. Within each region are located national forests and other lands of the Forest Service.
(1)
National Forests.
Each Forest has a headquarters office and is supervised by a Forest Supervisor who is responsible to the Regional Forester. Two or more proclaimed or designated National Forests, or all of the Forests in a State, may be combined into one Forest Service Administrative Unit headed by one Forest Supervisor. Each Forest is divided into Ranger Districts. The Alaska Region is composed of two National Forests without Ranger Districts; with one Forest divided into three areas, each administered by a Forest Supervisor.
(2)
Ranger districts.
Each district may include a portion of a national forest, a national grassland or portion thereof, a national recreation area, a wilderness or primitive area, and other lands administered by the Forest Service. Each district has a headquarters office and is supervised by a District Ranger (or Area Ranger in some cases) who is responsible to the Forest Supervisor.
(b)
Forest and rangeland research coordination.
The field research program is coordinated by six research stations, the national Forest Products Laboratory, and the International Institute of Tropical Forestry. Each has a headquarters office and a Director who is responsible to the Chief for all research activities within a geographical area of the United States or its territories. Scientists are based at Research Work Units with laboratories located in 36 lower States, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. Scientists primarily conduct their work within a given geographical area, but due to the integrated and cooperative nature of the research program, they make work nationwide and internationally.
(c)
State and private forestry cooperation.
Field level cooperation between the Forest Service, States, and the private sector on forestry activities is accomplished by the Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry for the Northeastern States; and by the National Forest Regional Offices in the Southeastern and Western States. The Northeastern Area is supervised by an Area Director who is responsible to the Chief for State and private forestry activities within the Area. Regional Foresters in Regions 1 through 8 and Region 10 are responsible for State and private forestry activities within those regions.
(d)
International Institute of Tropical Forestry.
The Institute is managed by a Director who is the senior Forest Service official in Puerto Rico. The Director is responsible to the Chief for planning and directing research, science and technology exchange, technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and international cooperation on natural resources concerning tropical forestry.
(e)
Field addresses.
The addresses of Regional Foresters, Station Directors, and Area Directors are given below. Under each Regional Office address is a list of National Forest Administrative Units by States with locations of Forest Supervisor headquarters. Headquarters locations for Ranger Districts, National Grasslands, and National
Recreation Areas are not listed but may be obtained from Forest Supervisors or Regional Foresters.

# Subpart B—Functions and Procedures
§ 200.3
Forest Service functions.
(a)
Legislative authority.
The basic laws authorizing activities of the Forest Service are set forth in the U.S.C. in title 7 (Agriculture), chapters 14, 17, 33, 55, 59, and 61; title 16 (Conservation), chapters 2, 3, 4, 5C, 6, 23, 27, 28, 30, 36, and 37; title 29 (Labor), chapter 17; and title 43 (Public Lands), chapters 22 and 35.

(b) Administrative policy, procedure, and guidance to Forest Service employees for the conduct of Forest Service activities are issued as directives, or through correspondence, by the office of the Chief of the Forest Service and by the field officers listed in § 200.2.
(1) Directives are issued through the Forest Service Directive System, which is comprised of the Forest Service Manual and related Forest Service Handbooks. The Directive System codifies the agency's policy, practice, and procedure affecting more than one unit and the delegations of continuing authority and assignment of continuing responsibilities; serves as the primary administrative basis for the internal management and control of all programs; and is the primary source of administrative direction to Forest Service employees.
(2) In contrast to direction issued through the Directive System, guidance issued to one or more organizational units through letters and memoranda relate to decisions or interpretations on specific activities, cases, or incidents or to other matters of agency business, especially those matters of short-term duration or immediate interest.
(c) Forest Service Directive System issuances are published under delegated authority as follows:
(1) The Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbook issuances to all Forest Service units are published by the Office of the Chief.
(2) Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbook issuances may be supplemented as needed for field office use by a Regional Forester, a Regional
Special Agent in Charge of Law Enforcement and Investigations, a Research Station Director, the International Institute for Tropical Forestry Director, the Area Director, or a Forest Supervisor.
(d) Guidance issued through letters and memoranda must be issued in accordance with signing authorities delegated through issuances to the Forest Service Directive System.
(e) An alphabetical index of the contents of the Forest Service Manual and related Forest Service Handbooks is published in Forest Service Handbook 1109.12, Directive System Handbook. The index contains a listing of all Series, Titles, and Chapters in the Forest Service Manual and a listing of all Forest Service Handbooks in the Directive System.
(f) Forest Service Handbook 6209.11, Records Management Handbook, outlines and indexes the filing system for all correspondence and other records.

However, Research Station and Institute Directors and District Rangers may not have all volumes of the Forest Service Manual and Handbooks. When the information requested is not available at a given location, the personnel where the request is received will direct the requester to another office where the information may be obtained.
(c) Inspection and copying availability is as follows:
(1) Facilities for inspection and copying are available at the offices listed in §§ 200.1 and 200.2, during established office hours for the particular location, usually 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. Copying facilities may not be available at all Forest Service offices.
(2) Requesters for information may make copies of available information without charge if they elect to bring their own copy equipment to the appropriate offices listed in §§ 200.1 and 200.2.
(3) Requesters should make prior arrangements for using agency copying facilities or for bringing in copying equipment and, in the later case, should get advance approval from the office.
(d) Any request for information pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act must be submitted in accordance with §§ 200.7 and 200.8. The Forest Service charges a fee for copies of records not generally made available to the public but released pursuant to a FOIA request in accordance with a schedule of fees established by the Department of Agriculture at 7
CFR Part 1, Subpart A, Appendix A. These fees do not apply to information that is generally and routinely made available to the public upon request, such as recreational brochures, pamphlets, maps, and technical guides as well as agency directive issuances. Separate charges for such general information are established in the agency's Directive System (§ 200.4). For example, some pamphlets and small segments of the Forest Service Manual and Handbook may be provided at no cost, but maps of the National Forest System and larger sections of the Manual and Handbook are available for a charge. Current charges are explained at the time the request is made.

§ 212.5
Road system management.
(a)
Traffic rules.
Rules set forth under 36 CFR part 261 and this section shall
apply to all National Forest System roads under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service except when in conflict with written agreement.
(1)
General.
Traffic on roads is subject to State traffic laws where applicable except when in conflict with designations established under subpart B of this part or with the rules at 36 CFR part 261.
(2)
Specific.
The following specific traffic rules shall apply unless different rules are established in 36 CFR part 261.
(i) The load, weight, length, height, and width limitations of vehicles shall be in accordance with the laws of the States wherein the road is located. Greater or lesser limits may be imposed and these greater or lesser limits shall be established as provided in 36 CFR part 261.
(ii) Roads, or segments thereof, may be restricted to use by certain classes of vehicles or types of traffic as provided in 36 CFR part 261. Classes of vehicles may include but are not limited to distinguishable groupings such as passenger cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, 4-wheel drive vehicles, off-highway vehicles, and trailers. Types of traffic may include but are not limited to groupings such as commercial hauling, recreation, and administrative.
(iii) Roads, or segments thereof, may be closed to all vehicle use as provided in 36 CFR part 261.
(iv) Additional rules may be imposed as provided in 36 CFR part 261.
(b) Road system—(1)
Identification of road system.
For each national forest, national grassland, experimental forest, and any other units of the National Forest System (§ 212.1), the responsible official must identify the minimum road system needed for safe and efficient travel and for administration, utilization, and protection of National Forest System lands. In determining the minimum road system, the responsible official must incorporate a science-based roads analysis at the appropriate scale and, to the degree practicable, involve a broad spectrum of interested and affected citizens, other state and federal agencies, and tribal governments. The minimum system is the road system determined to be needed to meet resource and other management objectives adopted in the relevant land and resource management plan (36 CFR part 219), to meet applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, to reflect long-term funding expectations, to ensure that the identified system minimizes adverse environmental impacts associated with road construction, reconstruction, decommissioning, and maintenance.
(2)
Identification of unneeded roads.
Responsible officials must review the road system on each National Forest and Grassland and identify the roads on lands under Forest Service jurisdiction that are no longer needed to meet forest resource management objectives and that, therefore, should be decommissioned or considered for other uses, such as for trails. Decommissioning roads involves restoring roads to a more natural state. Activities used to decommission a road include, but are not limited to, the following: reestablishing former drainage patterns, stabilizing slopes, restoring vegetation, blocking the entrance to the road, installing water bars, removing culverts, reestablishing drainage-ways, removing unstable fills, pulling back road shoulders, scattering slash on the roadbed, completely eliminating the roadbed by restoring natural contours and slopes, or other methods designed to meet the specific conditions associated with the unneeded road. Forest officials should give priority to decommissioning those unneeded roads that pose the greatest risk to public safety or to environmental degradation.
(c)
Cost recovery on National Forest System roads.
The Chief may determine that a share of the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, or maintenance of a road, or segment thereof, used or to be used for commercial hauling of non-Federal forests products and other non-Federal products, commodities and materials, should be borne by the owners or haulers thereof. The Chief may condition the permission to use a road, or segment thereof, upon payment to the United States of the proportionate share of the cost and bearing proportionate maintenance as determined to be attributable to the owner's or hauler's use in accordance with § 212.9. This
condition to use roads would apply where the owners or haulers:
(1) Have not shared in the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or improvements, and
(2) Have not made contributions to pay their proportionate share of the costs.
(d)
Maintenance and reconstruction of National Forest System roads by users
—(1)
Maintenance.
The Chief may require, but not in conflict with an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or users of a road, including purchasers of Government timber and other products, to maintain the roads in a satisfactory condition commensurate with the particular use requirements of each. The maintenance to be borne by each user shall be proportionate to total use and no individual user shall be required to perform or bear the costs of maintenance other than that commensurate with his use.
(2)
Reconstruction.
The Chief may require, but not in conflict with an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or users of a road to reconstruct it when, at the time the use is requested, reconstruction is determined to be necessary to accommodate his use.
(3)
Deposits in lieu of performance.
If the maintenance or reconstruction cannot be so provided or if the Chief determines that maintenance or reconstruction by a user would not be practical, the Chief may require that sufficient funds be deposited by the user to provide his portion of the total maintenance or reconstruction costs. Deposits made to cover maintenance or reconstruction of roads shall be used for the purposes deposited, except that:
(i) Deposits received for work on adjacent and overlapping areas may be combined when it is the most practicable and efficient manner of performing the work, and cost thereof may be determined by estimates, and
(ii) Unexpended balances upon accomplishment of the purposes for which deposited shall be transferred to miscellaneous receipts or refunded.
(e)
Deposits for making delayed payments to cooperator.
Any fees or other collections received by the Chief under the terms of an agreement or other document providing for delayed payments to the Government's cooperator for use of a road shall be placed in a fund available for making these payments.

§ 212.6
Ingress and egress.
(a)
Policy in acquiring and granting access.
To assure effective protection, management, and utilization of lands administered by the Forest Service and intermingled and adjacent private and public lands, and for the use and development of the resources upon which communities within or adjacent to the National Forests are dependent, the Chief shall as promptly as is feasible obtain needed access thereto and shall grant appropriate access across National Forest and other lands and easements administered by the Forest Service to intermingled or adjacent landowners. Construction, reconstruction or maintenance of a road or highway requires written authorization.
(b)
Actual settlers and other persons residing within the National Forests and other areas administered by the Forest Service.
Actual settlers and other persons residing within the National Forests and other areas administered by the Forest Service shall be permitted ingress and egress over the same and use of existing National Forest System roads and trails in order to reach their homes and to utilize their property: Provided, such ingress and egress or use shall conform to rules and regulations governing the protection and administration of the lands and the roads or trails to be used.
(c)
Others.
Entering upon the National Forests and other lands administered by the Forest Service and use of existing National Forest System roads and trails shall be permitted for all proper and lawful purposes subject to compliance with rules and regulations
governing the lands and the roads or trails to be used.

§ 212.7
Access procurement by the United States.
(a)
Existing or proposed forest roads that are or will be part of a transportation system of a State, county, or other local public road authority.
Forest roads that are or will be part of a transportation system of a State, county, or other local public road authority and are on rights-of-way held by a State, county, or other local public road authority may be constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained by the Forest Service when there is an appropriate agreement with the State, county, or other local public road authority under 23 U.S.C. 205 and the construction, reconstruction, improvement, or maintenance is essential to provide safe and economical access to National Forest System lands.
(b)
Acquisition of easements and rights of use.
Except as otherwise provided in the regulations of this part, easements for road and trail construction across non-Federal lands and easements or rights of use over non-Federal roads and trails will be acquired in the name of the United States of America and its assigns. The easements or rights of use may be acquired by purchase, condemnation, donation, or as a reciprocal for permits or easements for roads or trails to be constructed or for easements over or permits to use existing roads or trails.
(c)
Methods of compensation for easements and rights of use acquired by the United States.
Compensation in negotiated acquisitions may be:
(1) By payment from appropriated funds;
(2) Pursuant to reservation in the grant of easement to the United States whereby the grantor reserves the right to require haulers of Federal timber or other Federal products over the road conveyed or thereafter constructed by the grantor to make payments to the grantor in accordance with the terms of the reservation;
(3) By granting reciprocal rights; or
(4) By a combination of these methods.
(d)
Cooperative construction and use agreements.
Where areas, partly lands administered by the Forest Service and partly private or other ownership are undeveloped or inadequately developed by roads, the Chief will, to the extent feasible and advantageous to the United States, join in planning, constructing, reconstructing, improving, maintaining, and using an adequate road system on the basis of each party bearing the proportion of the cost attributable to the anticipated benefits as set forth in § 212.9.
(e)
Condemnation.
Where access across non-Federal land or over a non-Federal road or trail cannot be obtained through negotiations with reasonable promptness, condemnation will be undertaken.
(f)
Access over non-Federal land and use of non-Federal roads or trails on a temporary basis.
The Chief may negotiate a temporary agreement for access over non-Federal land and for use of an existing non-Federal road or trail where there is immediate need for temporary access for limited purposes that can be economically met by such procedure, or where the foreseeable need does not justify the expenditures necessary to provide a permanent road or trail.
(g)
Use and control of interests in roads, trails, and easements acquired by the United States.
Interests in roads, trails, and easements acquired by the United States shall be under the control of the United States, subject to approved reservations, limitations and other provisions set forth in the easement, permit, or other indenture. This control by the United States may include restricting or conditioning the use of the interest owned by the United States in the
road, trail, or easement where necessary.

§ 212.8
Permission to cross lands and easements owned by the United States and administered by the Forest Service.
(a)
Permission to construct or use roads across lands and assignable easements owned by the United States and administered by the Forest Service.
If a reciprocal benefit is needed by the United States, permission to construct or use a road across lands and across assignable easements owned by the United States and administered by the Forest Service will be conditioned, except as provided in this section, for any applicant who seeks a permit to construct or use a road across the same, upon the grant to the United States of a reciprocal benefit. Such benefit shall bear:
(1) A reasonable relation to the management of lands administered by the Forest Service; and
(2) A value substantially similar to the value of the estate or interest in lands or easements applied for. In those instances where the values of the interests needed by the United States exceed those applied for by the applicant, the additional interests required by the United States will be acquired as provided in § 212.7(b) and (c). Where values needed by the applicant exceed those needed by the United States, the difference in values will be determined under principles set forth below and in §§ 212.5(c) and 212.9. If a reciprocal benefit is not needed by the United States, or the applicant shows good cause why the reciprocal benefit needed by the United States cannot or should not be granted by him, or the applicant declines to grant the reciprocal benefit requested by the United States or if a bona fide emergency exists, permission to construct or use a road across lands owned by the United States may be conditioned for any applicant upon reasonable charges and all other terms and conditions required by the Chief to protect the interests of the United States. Permits for such road construction or use will be non-exclusive and will be conditioned upon compliance with their terms and conditions and with the rules and regulations governing the protection and administration of the lands and those applicable to such roads.
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Replacement of prior grants.
(1) Upon application to the Chief, an easement under the Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1233, 16 U.S.C. 525), shall be replaced by an easement under paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) Upon application to the Chief, an easement shall be granted under paragraph (d) of this section as a replacement for any stipulations for ingress and egress issued under the Act of June 4, 1897 or permit or other document evidencing the applicant's right to use a road:
Provided,
The applicant has met the requirements for obtaining such easement as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Easements for roads crossing lands or easements administered by the Forest Service.
(1) Applications for permanent or temporary easements for specified periods or otherwise to be granted under the Act of October 13, 1964 (78 Stat. 1039, 16 U.S.C. 533), over lands or easements administered by the Forest Service, or over roads thereon will be approved by the Chief for those applicants who have conveyed or provided appropriate easements over roads, assignable easements and lands owned or controlled by them to the United States of America and its assigns and who have already constructed, or will, as scheduled by agreement, construct their proportionate share of the road or road system of which the segments described in the application are parts. The Chief, after approval of the application and the grant of the easement, will cause the same to be entered in the records of the Forest Service, and delivered to the applicant.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Chief may grant to the applicant a permanent or temporary easement for specified periods or otherwise upon such exchange of easements or share-cost arrangement or other reasonable consideration as he may deem appropriate.
(3) The Chief may grant to a State or local subdivision thereof; easements for roads over lands or easements administered by the Forest Service and over roads thereon, when the roads thereon or roads to be constructed thereon will serve said lands and are, or will become a part of the road system maintained by such State or local subdivision for general public use:
Provided,
That easements shall not be granted under authority of this act (78 Stat. 1089), 16 U.S.C. 533 which may be granted under the Highway Act (72 Stat. 916, 23 U.S.C. 317), as amended. The easements shall contain such provisions, terms, and conditions as the Chief may determine are necessary to retain and protect the interests needed by the United States.
(4) All instruments affecting permanent interests in land executed pursuant to this paragraph (d) of this section shall be recorded in each county where the lands are located. Copies of all instruments affecting interests in lands reserved from public domain shall be furnished by the Chief to the Secretary of the Interior.
(5)(i) The Chief may revoke an easement granted under 36 CFR 251.53(j):
(A) With the grantee's consent;
(B) By condemnation; or
(C) After a 5-year period of nonuse by the grantee.
(ii) Before revocation of an easement granted under 36 CFR 251.53(j) for nonuse, a formal adjudicatory proceeding must be conducted pursuant to 7 CFR part 1, subpart H, provided the grantee requests the hearing within 60 days of receipt of the notice of revocation.

§ 212.9
Principles for sharing use of roads.
The use of roads under arrangements for sharing costs or performance shall be in accordance with the following:
(a)
Road improvement.
Use of a road for commercial hauling, except occasional or minor amounts, will be conditioned upon improvement or supplemental construction of the road to safety and economically serve the contemplated use, unless the Chief determines that the safety and economy of the established and foreseeable use by the United States, its users and cooperators will not be impaired by the use for which application is being made. With the consent of the Chief the applicant may deposit funds in the estimated amount required for the improvements or supplemental construction in lieu of performance. Such funds will be used by the Forest Service to do the planned work. The cost of the improvements or supplemental construction will be taken into account in determining any otherwise required contribution to cover the proportionate share of the cost of road acquisition, construction, reconstruction or improvement attributable to the use.
(b)
Corresponding benefits.
Corresponding benefits which may be accepted by the Chief for sharing road use will be those which bear a reasonable relation to the management of lands administered by the Forest Service. They may be in the form of:
(1) Deposit of funds with the Forest Service for use in paying the cost of road construction, reconstruction, or improvement to be borne by the user;
(2) The grant of a reciprocal right of substantially similar value to the road use sought;
(3) Construction, reconstruction, or improvement by applicant of a road needed for access to and use of lands administered by the Forest Service; or (4) any combination of these.
(c)
Cost determinations for roads cooperatively constructed under agreements.
When roads are constructed under cooperative agreements to meet mutual needs of the United States and others for access, determinations of the shares of costs to be borne by the United States and the cooperating parties will include consideration of:
(1) The standard of road required for the planned hauling;
(2) The share of planned use;
(3) The location and volume of tributary timber owned by each party and expected to be hauled over the road or roads;
(4) The tributary areas owned or controlled by each party;
(5) Expected use by the public; and
(6) Other appropriate considerations.
(d)
Cost recovery by the United States from others.
When roads are used under permit for commercial hauling instead of under cooperative agreement, any cost to be recovered by the United States will be calculated in proportion to the planned use of the road. The road cost used in such calculation will be the amount or estimated amount expended in the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and improvement of that capacity of the road required to serve the use needs of all parties that are or reasonably can be expected to use the road. The road costs shall not exceed the replacement value of the road. Such road share-cost payments will be through deposits in advance of use unless the user provides a payment bond satisfactory to the Chief guaranteeing that payments will be made promptly upon billing by the Forest Service.
(e)
Cost sharing with a cooperator.
The costs to achieve the agreed upon road or road system may be met by:
(1) Use of appropriated funds;
(2) Construction, reconstruction, or improvement of roads or segments of roads by purchasers of products from lands administered by the Forest Service or other users;
(3) Use of deposits made by cooperator with the Forest Service to cover cooperator's agreed share;
(4) Agreement with cooperator pursuant to which cooperator does more than his agreed share of constructing, reconstructing, or improving a road and recovers costs incurred in excess of his agreed share by charging purchasers of products from lands administered by the Forest Service an equitable amount within the limits and to the total amount specified in the agreement; or
(5) A combination of the aforementioned methods.
(f)
Road maintenance and resurfacing.
Cooperators will share the road maintenance and resurfacing costs under suitable agreements to perform, arrange for performance by others, or by making deposits with the Forest Service which will be used to pay the cost of work necessary to keep such roads in satisfactory condition commensurate with use requirements of each cooperator. No cooperator shall be required to perform or bear such costs other than those occasioned by its individual use. Other users will bear costs in accordance with § 212.5(d).
(g)
Interests to be acquired by the United States in roads or easements therefor.
Where the United States is to bear or share the cost of constructing or improving, or acquiring a road system, a road, or a segment thereof, or acquires an easement therefor, the interest acquired will:
(1) Be for perpetual use unless the road use falls within the limited classes where temporary roads or roads for limited periods are acceptable;
(2) Provide adequately for foreseeable management, protection, and utilization needs of lands administered by the Forest Service and intermingled and adjacent private and public lands and for the use and development of the resources upon which communities within or adjacent to the National Forest are dependent; and
(3) not be subject to conditions, reservations, or convenants unrelated to the road use, or which seek or might
tend to direct or limit policies and procedures for management of lands administered by the Forest Service.

Maximum economy National Forest System roads.
The Chief may acquire, construct, reconstruct, improve, and maintain National Forest System roads within and near the National Forests and other lands administered by the Forest Service in locations and according to specifications which will permit maximum economy in harvesting timber from such lands tributary to such roads and at the same time meet the requirements for protection, development, and management thereof and for utilization of the other resources thereof. Financing of such roads may be accomplished—
(a) By the Chief utilizing appropriated funds,
(b) By requirements on purchasers of National Forest timber and other products, including provisions for amortization of road costs in contracts,
(c) By cooperative financing with other public agencies and with private agencies or persons, or
(d) By a combination of these methods, provided that where roads are to be constructed at a higher standard than the standard—consistent with applicable environmental laws and regulations—that is sufficient for harvesting and removal of National Forest timber and other products covered by a particular sale, the purchaser of the timber and other products shall not be required to bear the part of the cost necessary to meet the higher standard, and the Chief may make such arrangements to achieve this end as may be appropriate.

Time period.
Upon receipt of the appeal decision, appeal, and appealable decision or Chief's decision, the Discretionary Reviewing Officer shall have 30 days to determine whether to conduct discretionary review and may request the appeal record or the record related to the Chief's decision during that time to assist in making that determination.

Notification.

§ 218.11
Resolution of objections.
(a)
Meetings.
Prior to the issuance of the reviewing officer's written response, either the reviewing officer or the objector may request to meet to discuss issues raised in the objection and potential resolution. The reviewing officer has the discretion to determine whether adequate time remains in the review period to make a meeting with the objector practical, the appropriate date, duration, agenda, and location for any meeting, and how the meeting will be conducted to facilitate the most beneficial dialogue; e.g., face-to-face office meeting, project site visit, teleconference, video conference, etc. The responsible official should be a participant along with the reviewing officer in any objection resolution meeting. Meetings are not required to be noticed but are open to attendance by the public, and the reviewing officer will determine whether those other than objectors may participate.
(b)
Reviewing officer's response to objections.
(1) A written response must set forth the reasons for the response, but need not be a point-by-point response and may contain instructions to the responsible official, if necessary. In cases involving more than one objection to a
proposed project or activity, the reviewing officer may consolidate objections and issue one or more responses.
(2) No further review from any other Forest Service or USDA official of the reviewing officer's written response to an objection is available.
§ 218.12
Timing of project decision.
(a) The responsible official may not sign a ROD or DN subject to the provisions of this part until the reviewing officer has responded in writing to all pending objections (see § 218.11(b)(1)).
(b) The responsible official may not sign a ROD or DN subject to the provisions of this part until all concerns and instructions identified by the reviewing officer in the objection response have been addressed.
(c) When no objection is filed within the objection filing period (see §§ 218.26 and 218.32):
(1) The reviewing officer must notify the responsible official.
(2) Approval of the proposed project or activity documented in a ROD in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.10, or in a DN may occur on, but not before, the fifth business day following the end of the objection filing period.
(d) When a proposed project or activity is not subject to objection because no timely, specific written comments regarding the proposal were received during a designated opportunity for public comment (see § 218.4), the approval of a proposed project or activity documented in a ROD must be in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.10 and 36 CFR 220.5(g), and the approval of a proposed project or activity documented in a DN must be made in accordance with 36 CFR 220.7(c) and (d).
§ 218.13
Secretary's authority.
(a) Nothing in this section shall restrict the Secretary of Agriculture from exercising any statutory authority regarding the protection, management, or administration of National Forest System lands.
(b) Projects and activities proposed by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Under Secretary, Natural Resources and Environment, are not subject to the procedures set forth in this part. Approval of projects and activities by the Secretary or Under Secretary constitutes the final administrative determination of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
§ 218.14
Judicial proceedings.
(a) The objection process set forth in this subpart fully implements Congress' design for a predecisional administrative review process. These procedures present a full and fair opportunity for concerns to be raised and considered on a project-by-project basis. Individuals and groups must structure their participation so as to alert the local agency officials making particular land management decisions of their positions and contentions.
(b) Any filing for Federal judicial review of a decisions covered by this subpart is premature and inappropriate unless the plaintiff has exhausted the administrative review process set forth in this part (see 7 U.S.C. 6912(e) and 16 U.S.C. 6515(c)).
§ 218.15
Information collection requirements.
The rules of this part specify the information that objectors must provide in an objection to a proposed project (see § 218.8). As such, these rules contain information collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320. These information requirements are assigned OMB Control Number 0596-0172.
§ 218.16
Effective dates.
(a)
Effective dates for HFRA-authorized projects.
(1) Provisions of this part that are applicable to hazardous fuel reduction projects authorized under the HFRA are in effect as of March 27, 2013 for projects where scoping begins on or after this date.
(2) Hazardous fuel reduction project proposals under the HFRA for which public scoping began prior to March 27, 2013 may use the predecisional objection procedures posted at
http://www.fs.fed.us/objections.
(3) Hazardous fuel reduction project proposals that are re-scoped with the public or re-issued for notice and comment after March 27, 2013 are subject to this part.
(b)
Effective dates for non-HFRA-authorized projects.
(1) Project proposals with public scoping completed, but
that have not had legal notice published. The applicable provisions of this part are in effect as of March 27, 2013 where public scoping was previously initiated for project proposals, but legal notice of the opportunity to comment has not yet been published; unless scoping or other public notification of the project (e.g. Schedule of Proposed Actions) has clearly indicated the project to be under the former 36 CFR part 215 appeal process.
(2) Project proposals which have legal notice published, but a Decision Notice or Record of Decision has not been signed. If a Decision Notice or Record of Decision is signed within 6 months of March 27, 2013, it will be subject to the 36 CFR part 215 appeal process. If the Decision Notice or Record of Decision is to be signed more than 6 months beyond March 27, 2013, the project proposal will be subject to the requirements of this part. In this case, the responsible official will notify all interested and affected parties who participated during scoping or provided specific written comment regarding the proposed project or activity during the comment period initiated with a legal notice that the project proposal will be subject to the predecisional objection regulations at 36 CFR part 218. All interested and affected parties who provided written comment as defined in § 218.2 during scoping or the comment period will be eligible to participate in the objection process.
(3) Project proposals are subject to the requirements of this part when initial public scoping, re-scoping with the public, or re-issuance of notice and comment begins on or after March 27, 2013.

# Subpart A—National Forest System Land Management Planning
§ 219.1
Purpose and applicability.
(a) This subpart sets out the planning requirements for developing, amending, and revising land management plans (also referred to as plans) for units of the National Forest System (NFS), as required by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1600
et seq.
) (NFMA). This subpart also sets out the requirements for plan components and other content in land management plans. This part is applicable to all units of the NFS as defined by 16 U.S.C. 1609 or subsequent statute.
(b) Consistent with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 (16 U.S.C. 528-531) (MUSYA), the Forest Service manages the NFS to sustain the multiple use of its renewable resources in perpetuity while maintaining the long-term health and productivity of the land. Resources are managed through a combination of approaches and concepts for the benefit of human communities and natural resources. Land management plans guide sustainable, integrated resource management of the resources within the plan area in the context of the broader landscape, giving due consideration to the relative values of the various resources in particular areas.
(c) The purpose of this part is to guide the collaborative and science-based development, amendment, and revision of land management plans that promote the ecological integrity of national forests and grasslands and other administrative units of the NFS. Plans will guide management of NFS lands so that they are ecologically sustainable and contribute to social and economic sustainability; consist of ecosystems and watersheds with ecological integrity and diverse plant and animal communities; and have the capacity to provide people and communities with ecosystem services and multiple uses that provide a range of social, economic, and ecological benefits for the present and into the future. These benefits include clean air and water; habitat for fish, wildlife, and plant communities; and opportunities for recreational, spiritual, educational, and cultural benefits.
(d) This part does not affect treaty rights or valid existing rights established by statute or legal instruments.
(e) During the planning process, the responsible official shall comply with Section 8106 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (25 U.S.C. 3056), Executive Order 13007 of May 24, 1996, Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000, laws, and other requirements with respect to disclosing or withholding under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) certain information regarding reburial sites or other information that is culturally sensitive to an Indian Tribe or Tribes.
(f) Plans must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including NFMA, MUSYA, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Wilderness Act, and the Endangered Species Act.
(g) The responsible official shall ensure that the planning process, plan components, and other plan content are within Forest Service authority, the inherent capability of the plan area, and the fiscal capability of the unit.
§ 219.2
Levels of planning and responsible officials.
Forest Service planning occurs at different organizational levels and geographic scales. Planning occurs at three levels—national strategic planning, NFS unit planning, and project or activity planning.
(a)
National strategic planning.
The Chief of the Forest Service is responsible for national planning, such as preparation of the Forest Service strategic plan required under the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 (5 U.S.C. 306; 31 U.S.C. 1115-1125; 31 U.S.C. 9703-9704), which is integrated with the requirements of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by the NFMA. The strategic plan establishes goals, objectives, performance measures, and strategies for management of the NFS, as well as the other Forest Service mission areas: Research and Development, State and Private Forestry, and International Programs.
(b)
National Forest System unit planning.
(1) NFS unit planning results in the development, amendment, or revision of a land management plan. A land management plan provides a framework for integrated resource management and for guiding project and activity decisionmaking on a national forest, grassland, prairie, or other administrative unit. A plan reflects the unit's expected distinctive roles and contributions to the local area, region, and Nation, and the roles for which the plan area is best suited, considering the Agency's mission, the unit's unique capabilities, and the resources and management of other lands in the vicinity. Through the adaptive planning cycle set forth in this subpart, a plan can be changed to reflect new information and changing conditions.
(2) A plan does not authorize projects or activities or commit the Forest Service to take action. A plan may constrain the Agency from authorizing or carrying out projects and activities, or the manner in which they may occur. Projects and activities must be consistent with the plan (§ 219.15). A plan does not regulate uses by the public, but a project or activity decision that regulates a use by the public under 36 CFR Part 261, Subpart B, may be made contemporaneously with the approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision. Plans should not repeat laws, regulations, or program management policies, practices, and procedures that are in the Forest Service Directive System.
(3) The supervisor of the national forest, grassland, prairie, or other comparable administrative unit is the responsible official for development and approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision for lands under the responsibility of the supervisor, unless a regional forester; the Chief; the Under Secretary, Natural Resources and Environment; or the Secretary acts as the responsible official. Two or more responsible officials may undertake joint planning over lands under their respective jurisdictions.
(4) A plan for a unit that contains an experimental area may not be approved without the concurrence of the appropriate research station director with respect to the direction applicable to that area, and a plan amendment applicable to an experimental area may not be approved without the concurrence of the appropriate research station director.
(5) The Chief is responsible for leadership and direction for carrying out the NFS land management planning program under this part. The Chief shall:
(i) Establish planning procedures for this part in the Forest Service Directive System in Forest Service Manual 1920—Land Management Planning and in Forest Service Handbook 1909.12—Land Management Planning Handbook.
(ii) Establish and administer a national oversight process for accountability and consistency of NFS land management planning under this part.
(iii) Establish procedures in the Forest Service Directive System for obtaining inventory data on the various renewable resources, and soil and water.
(c)
Project and activity planning.
The supervisor or district ranger is the responsible official for project and activity decisions, unless a higher-level official acts as the responsible official. Requirements for project or activity planning are established in the Forest Service Directive System. Except as provided in the plan consistency requirements in § 219.15, none of the requirements of this part apply to projects or activities.
§ 219.3
Role of science in planning.
The responsible official shall use the best available scientific information to inform the planning process required by this subpart for assessment; developing, amending, or revising a plan; and monitoring. In doing so, the responsible official shall determine what information is the most accurate, reliable, and relevant to the issues being considered. The responsible official shall document how the best available scientific information was used to inform the assessment, the plan or amendment decision, and the monitoring program as required in §§ 219.6(a)(3) and 219.14(a)(3). Such documentation must: Identify what information was determined to be the best available scientific information, explain the basis for that determination,
and explain how the information was applied to the issues considered.
[81 FR 90737, Dec. 15, 2016]
§ 219.4
Requirements for public participation.
(a)
Providing opportunities for participation.
The responsible official shall provide opportunities to the public for participating in the assessment process; developing a plan proposal, including the monitoring program; commenting on the proposal and the disclosure of its environmental impacts in accompanying National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents; and reviewing the results of monitoring information. When developing opportunities for public participation, the responsible official shall take into account the discrete and diverse roles, jurisdictions, responsibilities, and skills of interested and affected parties; the accessibility of the process, opportunities, and information; and the cost, time, and available staffing. The responsible official should be proactive and use contemporary tools, such as the Internet, to engage the public, and should share information in an open way with interested parties. Subject to the notification requirements in § 219.16, the responsible official has the discretion to determine the scope, methods, forum, and timing of those opportunities. The Forest Service retains decisionmaking authority and responsibility for all decisions throughout the process.
(1)
Outreach.
The responsible official shall engage the public—including Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, other Federal agencies, State and local governments, individuals, and public and private organizations or entities—early and throughout the planning process as required by this part, using collaborative processes where feasible and appropriate. In providing opportunities for engagement, the responsible official shall encourage participation by:
(i) Interested individuals and entities, including those interested at the local, regional, and national levels.
(ii) Youth, low-income populations, and minority populations.
(iii) Private landowners whose lands are in, adjacent to, or otherwise affected by, or whose actions may impact, future management actions in the plan area.
(iv) Federal agencies, States, counties, and local governments, including State fish and wildlife agencies, State foresters and other relevant State agencies. Where appropriate, the responsible official shall encourage States, counties, and other local governments to seek cooperating agency status in the NEPA process for development, amendment, or revision of a plan. The responsible official may participate in planning efforts of States, counties, local governments, and other Federal agencies, where practicable and appropriate.
(v) Interested or affected federally recognized Indian Tribes or Alaska Native Corporations. Where appropriate, the responsible official shall encourage federally recognized Tribes to seek cooperating agency status in the NEPA process for development, amendment, or revision of a plan. The responsible official may participate in planning efforts of federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, where practicable and appropriate.
(2)
Consultation with federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations.
The Department recognizes the Federal Government has certain trust responsibilities and a unique legal relationship with federally recognized Indian Tribes. The responsible official shall honor the government-to-government relationship between federally recognized Indian Tribes and the Federal Government. The responsible official shall provide to federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations the opportunity to undertake consultation consistent with Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000, and 25 U.S.C. 450 note.
(3)
Indigenous knowledge and land ethics.
As part of tribal participation and consultation as set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(v) and (a)(2) of this section, the responsible official shall request information about Indigenous Knowledge, land ethics, cultural issues, and sacred and culturally significant sites.
(b)
Coordination with other public planning efforts.
(1) The responsible official shall coordinate land management
planning with the equivalent and related planning efforts of federally recognized Indian Tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, other Federal agencies, and State and local governments.
(2) For plan development or revision, the responsible official shall review the planning and land use policies of federally recognized Indian Tribes (43 U.S.C. 1712(b)), Alaska Native Corporations, other Federal agencies, and State and local governments, where relevant to the plan area. The results of this review shall be displayed in the environmental impact statement (EIS) for the plan (40 CFR 1502.16(c), 1506.2). The review shall include consideration of:
(i) The objectives of federally recognized Indian Tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, other Federal agencies, and State and local governments, as expressed in their plans and policies;
(ii) The compatibility and interrelated impacts of these plans and policies;
(iii) Opportunities for the plan to address the impacts identified or to contribute to joint objectives; and
(iv) Opportunities to resolve or reduce conflicts, within the context of developing the plan's desired conditions or objectives.
(3) Nothing in this section should be read to indicate that the responsible official will seek to direct or control management of lands outside of the plan area, nor will the responsible official conform management to meet non-Forest Service objectives or policies.
[77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 44144, July 27, 2012; 89 FR 37137, May 6, 2024]
§ 219.5
Planning framework.
(a) Planning for a national forest, grassland, prairie, or other comparable administrative unit of the NFS is an iterative process that includes assessment (§ 219.6); developing, amending, or revising a plan (§§ 219.7 and 219.13); and monitoring (§ 219.12). These three phases of the framework are complementary and may overlap. The intent of this framework is to create a responsive planning process that informs integrated resource management and allows the Forest Service to adapt to changing conditions, including climate change, and improve management based on new information and monitoring.
(1)
Assessment.
Assessments rapidly evaluate existing information about relevant ecological, economic, and social conditions, trends, and sustainability and their relationship to the land management plan within the context of the broader landscape. The responsible official shall consider and evaluate existing and possible future conditions and trends of the plan area, and assess the sustainability of social, economic, and ecological systems within the plan area, in the context of the broader landscape (§ 219.6).
(2)
Plan development, plan amendment, or plan revision.
(i) The process for developing or revising a plan includes: Assessment, preliminary identification of the need to change the plan based on the assessment, development of a proposed plan, consideration of the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed plan, providing an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved, and, finally, approval of the plan or plan revision. A new plan or plan revision requires preparation of an environmental impact statement.
(ii) The process for amending a plan includes: Preliminary identification of the need to change the plan, development of a proposed amendment, consideration of the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed amendment, providing an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved, and, finally, approval of the plan amendment. The appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment may be an environmental impact statement, an environmental assessment, or a categorical exclusion, depending upon the scope and scale of the amendment and its likely effects.
(3)
Monitoring.
Monitoring is continuous and provides feedback for the planning cycle by testing relevant assumptions, tracking relevant conditions over time, and measuring management effectiveness (§ 219.12). The monitoring program includes plan-level and broader-scale monitoring. The plan-level monitoring program is
informed by the assessment phase; developed during plan development, plan amendment, or plan revision; and implemented after plan decision. The regional forester develops broader-scale monitoring strategies. Biennial monitoring evaluation reports document whether a change to the plan or change to the monitoring program is warranted based on new information, whether a new assessment may be needed, or whether there is no need for change at that time.
(b)
Interdisciplinary team(s).
The responsible official shall establish an interdisciplinary team or teams to prepare assessments; new plans, plan amendments, and plan revisions; and plan monitoring programs.
§ 219.6
Assessment.
The responsible official has the discretion to determine the scope, scale, and timing of an assessment described in § 219.5(a)(1), subject to the requirements of this section.
(a)
Process for plan development or revision assessments.
An assessment must be completed for the development of a new plan or for a plan revision. The responsible official shall:
(1) Identify and consider relevant existing information in governmental or non-governmental assessments, plans, monitoring reports, studies, and other sources of relevant information. Such sources of information may include State forest assessments and strategies, the Resources Planning Act assessment, ecoregional assessments, non-governmental reports, State comprehensive outdoor recreation plans, community wildfire protection plans, public transportation plans, State wildlife data and action plans, and relevant Agency or interagency reports, resource plans or assessments. Relevant private information, including relevant land management plans and local knowledge, will be considered if publicly available or voluntarily provided.
(2) Coordinate with or provide opportunities for the regional forester, agency staff from State and Private Forestry and Research and Development, federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, other governmental and non-governmental parties, and the public to provide existing information for the assessment.
(3) Document the assessment in a report available to the public. The report should document information needs relevant to the topics of paragraph (b) of this section. Document in the report how the best available scientific information was used to inform the assessment (§ 219.3). Include the report in the planning record (§ 219.14).
(b)
Content of the assessment for plan development or revision.
In the assessment for plan development or revision, the responsible official shall identify and evaluate existing information relevant to the plan area for the following:
(1) Terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems, and watersheds;
(2) Air, soil, and water resources and quality;
(3) System drivers, including dominant ecological processes, disturbance regimes, and stressors, such as natural succession, wildland fire, invasive species, and climate change; and the ability of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems on the plan area to adapt to change;
(4) Baseline assessment of carbon stocks;
(5) Threatened, endangered, proposed and candidate species, and potential species of conservation concern present in the plan area;
(6) Social, cultural, and economic conditions;
(7) Benefits people obtain from the NFS planning area (ecosystem services);
(8) Multiple uses and their contributions to local, regional, and national economies;
(9) Recreation settings, opportunities and access, and scenic character;
(10) Renewable and nonrenewable energy and mineral resources;
(11) Infrastructure, such as recreational facilities and transportation and utility corridors;
(12) Areas of tribal importance;
(13) Cultural and historic resources and uses;
(14) Land status and ownership, use, and access patterns; and
(15) Existing designated areas located in the plan area including wilderness
and wild and scenic rivers and potential need and opportunity for additional designated areas.
(c)
Plan amendment assessments.
Where the responsible official determines that a new assessment is needed to inform an amendment, the responsible official has the discretion to determine the scope, scale, process, and content for the assessment depending on the topic or topics to be addressed.
[77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 44145, July 27, 2012]
§ 219.7
New plan development or plan revision.
(a)
Plan revisions.
A plan revision creates a new plan for the entire plan area, whether the plan revision differs from the prior plan to a small or large extent. A plan must be revised at least every 15 years. But, the responsible official has the discretion to determine at any time that conditions on a plan area have changed significantly such that a plan must be revised (16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(5)).
(b)
New plan development.
New plan development is required for new NFS units. The process for developing a new plan is the same as the process for plan revision.
(c)
Process for plan development or revision.
(1) The process for developing or revising a plan includes: Public notification and participation (§§ 219.4 and 219.16), assessment (§§ 219.5 and 219.6), developing a proposed plan, considering the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed plan, providing an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved (subpart B), and, finally, approving the plan or plan revision. A new plan or plan revision requires preparation of an environmental impact statement.
(2) In developing a proposed new plan or proposed plan revision, the responsible official shall:
(i) Review relevant information from the assessment and monitoring to identify a preliminary need to change the existing plan and to inform the development of plan components and other plan content.
(ii) Consider the goals and objectives of the Forest Service strategic plan (§ 219.2(a)).
(iii) Identify the presence and consider the importance of various physical, biological, social, cultural, and historic resources on the plan area (§ 219.6), with respect to the requirements for plan components of §§ 219.8 through 219.11.
(iv) Consider conditions, trends, and stressors (§ 219.6), with respect to the requirements for plan components of §§ 219.8 through 219.11.
(v) Identify and evaluate lands that may be suitable for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System and determine whether to recommend any such lands for wilderness designation.
(vi) Identify the eligibility of rivers for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, unless a systematic inventory has been previously completed and documented and there are no changed circumstances that warrant additional review.
(vii) Identify existing designated areas other than the areas identified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and (c)(2)(vi) of this section, and determine whether to recommend any additional areas for designation. If the responsible official has the delegated authority to designate a new area or modify an existing area, then the responsible official may designate such area when approving the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision.
(viii) Identify the suitability of areas for the appropriate integration of resource management and uses, with respect to the requirements for plan components of §§ 219.8 through 219.11, including identifying lands that are not suitable for timber production (§ 219.11).
(ix) Identify the maximum quantity of timber that may be removed from the plan area (§ 219.11(d)(6)).
(x) Identify questions and indicators for the plan monitoring program (§ 219.12).
(xi) Identify potential other content in the plan (paragraph (f) of this section).
(3) The regional forester shall identify the species of conservation concern for the plan area in coordination with the responsible official.
(d)
Management areas or geographic areas.
Every plan must have management areas or geographic areas or
both. The plan may identify designated or recommended designated areas as management areas or geographic areas.
(e)
Plan components.
Plan components guide future project and activity decisionmaking. The plan must indicate whether specific plan components apply to the entire plan area, to specific management areas or geographic areas, or to other areas as identified in the plan.
(1)
Required plan components.
Every plan must include the following plan components:
(i)
Desired conditions.
A desired condition is a description of specific social, economic, and/or ecological characteristics of the plan area, or a portion of the plan area, toward which management of the land and resources should be directed. Desired conditions must be described in terms that are specific enough to allow progress toward their achievement to be determined, but do not include completion dates.
(ii)
Objectives.
An objective is a concise, measurable, and time-specific statement of a desired rate of progress toward a desired condition or conditions. Objectives should be based on reasonably foreseeable budgets.
(iii)
Standards.
A standard is a mandatory constraint on project and activity decisionmaking, established to help achieve or maintain the desired condition or conditions, to avoid or mitigate undesirable effects, or to meet applicable legal requirements.
(iv)
Guidelines.
A guideline is a constraint on project and activity decisionmaking that allows for departure from its terms, so long as the purpose of the guideline is met. (§ 219.15(d)(3)). Guidelines are established to help achieve or maintain a desired condition or conditions, to avoid or mitigate undesirable effects, or to meet applicable legal requirements.
(v)
Suitability of lands.
Specific lands within a plan area will be identified as suitable for various multiple uses or activities based on the desired conditions applicable to those lands. The plan will also identify lands within the plan area as not suitable for uses that are not compatible with desired conditions for those lands. The suitability of lands need not be identified for every use or activity. Suitability identifications may be made after consideration of historic uses and of issues that have arisen in the planning process. Every plan must identify those lands that are not suitable for timber production (§ 219.11).
(2)
Optional plan component: goals.
A plan may include goals as plan components. Goals are broad statements of intent, other than desired conditions, usually related to process or interaction with the public. Goals are expressed in broad, general terms, but do not include completion dates.
(3)
Requirements for the set of plan components.
The set of plan components must meet the requirements set forth in this part for sustainability (§ 219.8), plant and animal diversity (§ 219.9), multiple use (§ 219.10), and timber (§ 219.11).
(f)
Other content in the plan.
(1)
Other required content in the plan.
Every plan must:
(i) Identify watershed(s) that are a priority for maintenance or restoration;
(ii) Describe the plan area's distinctive roles and contributions within the broader landscape;
(iii) Include the monitoring program required by § 219.12; and
(iv) Contain information reflecting proposed and possible actions that may occur on the plan area during the life of the plan, including: the planned timber sale program; timber harvesting levels; and the proportion of probable methods of forest vegetation management practices expected to be used (16 U.S.C. 1604(e)(2) and (f)(2)). Such information is not a commitment to take any action and is not a “proposal” as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1508.23, 42 U.S.C. 4322(2)(C)).
(2)
Optional content in the plan.
A plan may include additional content, such as potential management approaches or strategies and partnership opportunities or coordination activities.

[77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 81 FR 90737, Dec. 15, 2016]
§ 219.9
Diversity of plant and animal communities.
This section adopts a complementary ecosystem and species-specific approach to maintaining the diversity of plant and animal communities and the persistence of native species in the plan area. Compliance with the ecosystem requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is intended to provide the ecological conditions to both maintain the diversity of plant and animal communities and support the persistence of most native species in the plan area. Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is intended to provide for additional ecological conditions not otherwise provided by compliance with paragraph (a) of this section for individual species as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. A plan developed or revised under this part must provide for the diversity of plant and animal communities, within Forest Service authority and consistent with the inherent capability of the plan area, as follows:
(a)
Ecosystem plan components.
(1)
Ecosystem integrity.
As required by § 219.8(a), the plan must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to maintain or restore the ecological integrity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and watersheds in the plan area, including plan components to maintain or restore their structure, function, composition, and connectivity.
(2)
Ecosystem diversity.
The plan must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to maintain or restore the diversity of ecosystems and habitat types throughout the plan area. In doing so, the plan must include plan components to maintain or restore:
(i) Key characteristics associated with terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem types;
(ii) Rare aquatic and terrestrial plant and animal communities; and
(iii) The diversity of native tree species similar to that existing in the plan area.
(b)
Additional, species-specific plan components.
(1) The responsible official shall determine whether or not the plan components required by paragraph (a) of this section provide the ecological conditions necessary to: contribute to the recovery of federally listed threatened and endangered species, conserve proposed and candidate species, and maintain a viable population of each species of conservation concern within the plan area. If the responsible official determines that the plan components required in paragraph (a) are insufficient to provide such ecological conditions, then additional, species-specific plan components, including standards or guidelines, must be included in the plan to provide such ecological conditions in the plan area.
(2) If the responsible official determines that it is beyond the authority of the Forest Service or not within the inherent capability of the plan area to maintain or restore the ecological conditions to maintain a viable population of a species of conservation concern in the plan area, then the responsible official shall:
(i) Document the basis for that determination (§ 219.14(a)); and
(ii) Include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to maintain or restore ecological conditions within the plan area to contribute to maintaining a viable population of the species within its range. In providing such plan components, the responsible official shall coordinate to the extent practicable with other Federal, State, Tribal, and private land managers having management authority over lands relevant to that population.
(c)
Species of conservation concern.
For purposes of this subpart, a species of conservation concern is a species, other than federally recognized threatened, endangered, proposed, or candidate species, that is known to occur in the plan area and for which the regional forester has determined that the best
available scientific information indicates substantial concern about the species' capability to persist over the long-term in the plan area.

§ 219.10
Multiple use.
While meeting the requirements of §§ 219.8 and 219.9, a plan developed or revised under this part must provide for ecosystem services and multiple uses, including outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, wildlife, and fish, within Forest Service authority and the inherent capability of the plan area as follows:
(a)
Integrated resource management for multiple use.
The plan must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, for integrated resource management to provide for ecosystem services and multiple uses in the plan area. When developing plan components for integrated resource management, to the extent relevant to the plan area and the public participation process and the requirements of §§ 219.7, 219.8, 219.9, and 219.11, the responsible official shall consider:
(1) Aesthetic values, air quality, cultural and heritage resources, ecosystem services, fish and wildlife species, forage, geologic features, grazing and rangelands, habitat and habitat connectivity, recreation settings and opportunities, riparian areas, scenery, soil, surface and subsurface water quality, timber, trails, vegetation, viewsheds, wilderness, and other relevant resources and uses.
(2) Renewable and nonrenewable energy and mineral resources.
(3) Appropriate placement and sustainable management of infrastructure, such as recreational facilities and transportation and utility corridors.
(4) Opportunities to coordinate with neighboring landowners to link open spaces and take into account joint management objectives where feasible and appropriate.

(6) Land status and ownership, use, and access patterns relevant to the plan area.
(7) Reasonably foreseeable risks to ecological, social, and economic sustainability.
(8) System drivers, including dominant ecological processes, disturbance regimes, and stressors, such as natural succession, wildland fire, invasive species, and climate change; and the ability of the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems on the plan area to adapt to change (§ 219.8);
(9) Public water supplies and associated water quality.
(10) Opportunities to connect people with nature.
(b)
Requirements for plan components for a new plan or plan revision.
(1) The plan must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to provide for:
(i) Sustainable recreation; including recreation settings, opportunities, and access; and scenic character. Recreation opportunities may include non-motorized, motorized, developed, and dispersed recreation on land, water, and in the air.
(ii) Protection of cultural and historic resources.
(iii) Management of areas of tribal importance.
(iv) Protection of congressionally designated wilderness areas as well as management of areas recommended for wilderness designation to protect and maintain the ecological and social characteristics that provide the basis for their suitability for wilderness designation.
(v) Protection of designated wild and scenic rivers as well as management of rivers found eligible or determined suitable for the National Wild and Scenic River system to protect the values that provide the basis for their suitability for inclusion in the system.

[77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 81 FR 90737, Dec. 15, 2016]
§ 219.11
Timber requirements based on the NFMA.
While meeting the requirements of §§ 219.8 through 219.10, a plan developed or revised under this part must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, and other plan content regarding timber management within Forest Service authority and the inherent capability of the plan area, as follows:
(a)
Lands not suited for timber production.
(1) The responsible official shall identify lands within the plan area as not suited for timber production if any one of the following factors applies:
(i) Statute, Executive order, or regulation prohibits timber production on the land;
(ii) The Secretary of Agriculture or the Chief has withdrawn the land from timber production;
(iii) Timber production would not be compatible with the achievement of desired conditions and objectives established by the plan for those lands;
(iv) The technology is not currently available for conducting timber harvest without causing irreversible damage to soil, slope, or other watershed conditions;
(v) There is no reasonable assurance that such lands can be adequately restocked within 5 years after final regeneration harvest; or
(vi) The land is not forest land.
(2) The responsible official shall review lands identified in the plan as not suited for timber production at least once every 10 years, or as otherwise prescribed by law, to determine whether conditions have changed so that they have become suitable for timber production. As a result of this 10-year review, the plan may be amended to identify any such lands as suitable for timber production, if warranted by changed conditions.
(b)
Timber harvest for purposes of timber production.
A plan that identifies lands as suitable for timber production must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to guide timber harvest for timber production or for other multiple use purposes on such lands.
(c)
Timber harvest for purposes other than timber production.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the plan may include plan components to allow for timber harvest for purposes other than timber production throughout the plan area, or portions of the plan area, as a tool to assist in achieving or maintaining one or more applicable desired conditions or objectives of the plan in order to protect other multiple-use values, and for salvage, sanitation, or public health or safety. Examples of using timber harvest to protect other multiple use values may include improving wildlife or fish habitat, thinning to reduce fire risk, or restoring meadow or savanna ecosystems where trees have invaded.
(d)
Limitations on timber harvest.
Whether timber harvest would be for the purposes of timber production or other purposes, plan components, including standards or guidelines, must ensure the following:
(1) No timber harvest for the purposes of timber production may occur on lands not suited for timber production.
(2) Timber harvest would occur only where soil, slope, or other watershed conditions would not be irreversibly damaged;
(3) Timber harvest would be carried out in a manner consistent with the protection of soil, watershed, fish, wildlife, recreation, and aesthetic resources.
(4) Where plan components will allow clearcutting, seed tree cutting, shelterwood cutting, or other cuts designed to regenerate an even-aged stand of timber, the plan must include standards limiting the maximum size for openings that may be cut in one harvest operation, according to geographic areas, forest types, or other suitable classifications. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, this limit may not
exceed 60 acres for the Douglas-fir forest type of California, Oregon, and Washington; 80 acres for the southern yellow pine types of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas; 100 acres for the hemlock-Sitka spruce forest type of coastal Alaska; and 40 acres for all other forest types.
(i) Plan standards may allow for openings larger than those specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section to be cut in one harvest operation where the responsible official determines that larger harvest openings are necessary to help achieve desired ecological conditions in the plan area. If so, standards for exceptions shall include the particular conditions under which the larger size is permitted and must set a maximum size permitted under those conditions.
(ii) Plan components may allow for size limits exceeding those established in paragraphs (d)(4) introductory text and (d)(4)(i) of this section on an individual timber sale basis after 60 days public notice and review by the regional forester.
(iii) The plan maximum size for openings to be cut in one harvest operation shall not apply to the size of openings harvested as a result of natural catastrophic conditions such as fire, insect and disease attack, or windstorm (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(F)(iv)).
(5) Timber will be harvested from NFS lands only where such harvest would comply with the resource protections set out in sections 6(g)(3)(E) and (F) of the NFMA (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(E) and (F)). Some of these requirements are listed in paragraphs (d)(2) to (d)(4) of this section.
(6) The quantity of timber that may be sold from the national forest is limited to an amount equal to or less than that which can be removed from such forest annually in perpetuity on a sustained yield basis. This limit may be measured on a decadal basis.
(i) The plan may provide for departures from this limit as provided by the NFMA when departure would be consistent with the plan's desired conditions and objectives. Exceptions for departure from this limit on the quantity sold may be made only after a public review and comment period of at least 90 days.
(ii) This limit may be based upon increases in harvest levels based on intensified management practices, such as reforestation, thinning, and tree improvement if such practices justify increasing the harvests in accordance with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. The plan must require that such harvest levels be decreased at the end of each planning period if such practices cannot be successfully implemented or funds are not received to permit such practices to continue substantially as planned.
(iii) The Chief must include in the Forest Service Directive System procedures for estimating the quantity of timber that can be removed annually in perpetuity on a sustained-yield basis, and exceptions, consistent with 16 U.S.C. 1611.
(7) The regeneration harvest of even-aged stands of trees is limited to stands that generally have reached the culmination of mean annual increment of growth. This requirement would apply only to regeneration harvest of even-aged stands on lands identified as suitable for timber production and where timber production is the primary purpose for the harvest. Plan components may allow for exceptions, set out in 16 U.S.C. 1604(m), only if such harvest is consistent with the other plan components of the land management plan.
[77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 44145, July 27, 2012; 78 FR 23492, Apr. 19, 2013; 81 FR 90737, Dec. 15, 2016; 86 FR 68149, Dec. 1, 2021]
§ 219.12
Monitoring.
(a)
Plan monitoring program.
(1) The responsible official shall develop a monitoring program for the plan area and include it in the plan. Monitoring information should enable the responsible official to determine if a change in plan components or other plan content that guide management of resources on the plan area may be needed. The development of the plan monitoring program must be coordinated with the regional forester and Forest Service State and Private Forestry and
Research and Development. Responsible officials for two or more administrative units may jointly develop their plan monitoring programs.
(2) The plan monitoring program sets out the plan monitoring questions and associated indicators. Monitoring questions and associated indicators must be designed to inform the management of resources on the plan area, including by testing relevant assumptions, tracking relevant changes, and measuring management effectiveness and progress toward achieving or maintaining the plan's desired conditions or objectives. Questions and indicators should be based on one or more desired conditions, objectives, or other plan components in the plan, but not every plan component needs to have a corresponding monitoring question.
(3) The plan monitoring program should be coordinated and integrated with relevant broader-scale monitoring strategies (paragraph (b) of this section) to ensure that monitoring is complementary and efficient, and that information is gathered at scales appropriate to the monitoring questions.
(4) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the responsible official has the discretion to set the scope and scale of the plan monitoring program, after considering:
(i) Information needs identified through the planning process as most critical for informed management of resources on the plan area; and
(ii) The financial and technical capabilities of the Agency.
(5) Each plan monitoring program must contain one or more monitoring questions and associated indicators addressing each of the following:
(i) The status of select watershed conditions.
(ii) The status of select ecological conditions including key characteristics of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
(iii) The status of focal species to assess the ecological conditions required under § 219.9.
(iv) The status of a select set of the ecological conditions required under § 219.9 to contribute to the recovery of federally listed threatened and endangered species, conserve proposed and candidate species, and maintain a viable population of each species of conservation concern.
(v) The status of visitor use, visitor satisfaction, and progress toward meeting recreation objectives.
(vi) Measurable changes on the plan area related to climate change and other stressors that may be affecting the plan area.
(vii) Progress toward meeting the desired conditions and objectives in the plan, including for providing multiple use opportunities.
(viii) The effects of each management system to determine that they do not substantially and permanently impair the productivity of the land (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(C)).
(6) A range of monitoring techniques may be used to carry out the monitoring requirements in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
(7) This section does not apply to projects or activities. Project and activity monitoring may be used to gather information for the plan monitoring program, and information gathered through plan monitoring may be used to inform development of projects or activities. But, the monitoring requirements of this section are not a prerequisite for making a decision to carry out a project or activity.
(b)
Broader-scale monitoring strategies.
(1) The regional forester shall develop a broader-scale monitoring strategy for plan monitoring questions that can best be answered at a geographic scale broader than one plan area.
(2) When developing a monitoring strategy, the regional forester shall coordinate with the relevant responsible officials, Forest Service State and Private Forestry and Research and Development, partners, and the public. Two or more regional foresters may jointly develop broader-scale monitoring strategies.
(3) Each regional forester shall ensure that the broader-scale monitoring strategy is within the financial and technical capabilities of the region and complements other ongoing monitoring efforts.
(4) Projects and activities may be carried out under plans developed, amended, or revised under this part before the regional forester has developed a broader-scale monitoring strategy.
(c)
Timing and process for developing the plan monitoring program and broader-scale strategies.
(1) The responsible official shall develop the plan monitoring program as part of the planning process for a new plan development or plan revision. Where a plan's monitoring program has been developed under the provisions of a prior planning regulation and the unit has not initiated plan revision under this part, the responsible official shall modify the plan monitoring program within 4 years of the effective date of this part, or as soon as practicable, to meet the requirements of this section.
(2) The regional forester shall develop a broader-scale monitoring strategy as soon as practicable.
(3) To the extent practicable, appropriate, and relevant to the monitoring questions in the plan monitoring program, plan monitoring programs and broader-scale strategies must be designed to take into account:
(i) Existing national and regional inventory, monitoring, and research programs of the Agency, including from the NFS, State and Private Forestry, and Research and Development, and of other governmental and non-governmental entities;
(ii) Opportunities to design and carry out multi-party monitoring with other Forest Service units, Federal, State or local government agencies, scientists, partners, and members of the public; and
(iii) Opportunities to design and carry out monitoring with federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations.
(d)
Biennial evaluation of the monitoring information.
(1) The responsible official shall conduct a biennial evaluation of new information gathered through the plan monitoring program and relevant information from the broader-scale strategy, and shall issue a written report of the evaluation and make it available to the public.
(i) The first monitoring evaluation for a plan or plan revision developed in accordance with this subpart must be completed no later than 2 years from the effective date of plan decision.
(ii) Where the monitoring program developed under the provisions of a prior planning regulation has been modified to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the first monitoring evaluation must be completed no later than 2 years from the date the change takes effect.
(iii) The monitoring evaluation report may be postponed for 1 year in case of exigencies, but notice of the postponement must be provided to the public prior to the date the report is due for that year (§ 219.16(c)(6)).
(2) The monitoring evaluation report must indicate whether or not a change to the plan, management activities, or the monitoring program, or a new assessment, may be warranted based on the new information. The monitoring evaluation report must be used to inform adaptive management of the plan area.
(3) The monitoring evaluation report may be incorporated into other planning documents if the responsible official has initiated a plan revision or relevant amendment.
(4) The monitoring evaluation report is not a decision document representing final Agency action, and is not subject to the objection provisions of subpart B.
§ 219.13
Plan amendment and administrative changes.
(a)
Plan amendment.
A plan may be amended at any time. Plan amendments may be broad or narrow, depending on the need for change, and should be used to keep plans current and help units adapt to new information or changing conditions. The responsible official has the discretion to determine whether and how to amend the plan and to determine the scope and scale of any amendment. Except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, a plan amendment is required to add, modify, or remove one or more plan components, or to change how or where one or more plan components apply to all or part of the plan area (including management areas or geographic areas).
(b)
Amendment requirements.
For every plan amendment, the responsible official shall:
(1) Base an amendment on a preliminary identification of the need to change the plan. The preliminary identification of the need to change the
plan may be based on a new assessment; a monitoring report; or other documentation of new information, changed conditions, or changed circumstances. When a plan amendment is made together with, and only applies to, a project or activity decision, the analysis prepared for the project or activity may serve as the documentation for the preliminary identification of the need to change the plan.
(2) Provide opportunities for public participation as required in § 219.4 and public notification as required in § 219.16. The responsible official may combine processes and associated public notifications where appropriate, considering the scope and scale of the need to change the plan. The responsible official must include information in the initial notice for the amendment (§ 219.16(a)(1)) about which substantive requirements of §§ 219.8 through 219.11 are likely to be directly related to the amendment (§ 219.13(b)(5)).
(3) Amend the plan consistent with Forest Service NEPA procedures. The appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment may be an environmental impact statement, an environmental assessment, or a categorical exclusion, depending upon the scope and scale of the amendment and its likely effects. Except for an amendment that applies only to one project or activity, a proposed amendment that may create a significant environmental effect and thus requires preparation of an environmental impact statement is considered a significant change in the plan for the purposes of the NFMA and therefore requires a 90-day comment period for the proposed plan and draft environmental impact statement (§ 219.16(a)(2)), in addition to meeting the requirements of this section.
(4) Follow the applicable format for plan components set out at § 219.7(e) for the plan direction added or modified by the amendment, except that where an amendment to a plan developed or revised under a prior planning regulation would simply modify the area to which existing direction applies, the responsible official may retain the existing formatting for that direction.
(5) Determine which specific substantive requirement(s) within §§ 219.8 through 219.11 are directly related to the plan direction being added, modified, or removed by the amendment and apply such requirement(s) within the scope and scale of the amendment. The responsible official is not required to apply any substantive requirements within §§ 219.8 through 219.11 that are not directly related to the amendment.
(i) The responsible official's determination must be based on the purpose for the amendment and the effects (beneficial or adverse) of the amendment, and informed by the best available scientific information, scoping, effects analysis, monitoring data or other rationale.
(ii) When basing the determination on adverse effects:
(A) The responsible official must determine that a specific substantive requirement is directly related to the amendment when scoping or NEPA effects analysis for the proposed amendment reveals substantial adverse effects associated with that requirement, or when the proposed amendment would substantially lessen protections for a specific resource or use.
(B) If the appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment is a categorical exclusion or an environmental assessment accompanied by a finding of no significant impact (§ 219.13(b)(3)), there is a rebuttable presumption that the amendment will not have substantial adverse effects.
(6) For an amendment to a plan developed or revised under a prior planning regulation, if species of conservation concern (SCC) have not been identified for the plan area and if scoping or NEPA effects analysis for the proposed amendment reveals substantial adverse impacts to a specific species, or if the proposed amendment would substantially lessen protections for a specific species, the responsible official must determine whether such species is a potential SCC, and if so, apply section § 219.9(b) with respect to that species as if it were an SCC.
(c)
Administrative changes.
An administrative change is any change to a plan that is not a plan amendment or plan revision. Administrative changes include corrections of clerical errors to any part of the plan, conformance of the plan to new statutory or regulatory
requirements, or changes to other content in the plan (§ 219.7(f)).
(1) A substantive change to the monitoring program made outside of the process for plan revision or amendment may be made only after notice to the public of the intended change and consideration of public comment (§ 219.16(c)(6)).
(2) All other administrative changes may be made following public notice (§ 219.16(c)(6)).
[77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 81 FR 90738, Dec. 15, 2016]
§ 219.14
Decision document and planning records.
(a)
Decision document approving a new plan, plan amendment, or revision.
The responsible official shall record approval of a new plan, plan amendment, or revision in a decision document prepared according to Forest Service NEPA procedures (36 CFR part 220). The decision document must include:
(1) The rationale for approval;
(2) A statement of how the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision applies to approved projects and activities (§ 219.15);
(3) The documentation of how the best available scientific information was used to inform planning, the plan components, and other plan content, including the plan monitoring program (§ 219.3);
(4) The concurrence by the appropriate research station director with any part of the plan applicable to any experimental forests or experimental ranges (§ 219.2(b)(4)); and
(5) The effective date of the plan, amendment, or revision.
(b)
Decision document for a new plan or plan revision.
In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the decision document must include an explanation of how the plan components meet the sustainability requirements of § 219.8, the diversity requirements of § 219.9, the multiple use requirements of § 219.10, and the timber requirements of § 219.11.
(c)
Decision document for a plan amendment.
In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the decision document must explain how the responsible official determined:
(1) The scope and scale of the plan amendment; and
(2) Which specific requirements within §§ 219.8 through 219.11 apply to the amendment and how they were applied.
(d)
Planning records.
(1) The responsible official shall keep the following documents readily accessible to the public by posting them online and through other means: assessment reports (§ 219.6); the plan, including the monitoring program; the proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision; public notices and environmental documents associated with a plan; plan decision documents; and monitoring evaluation reports (§ 219.12).
(2) The planning record includes documents that support analytical conclusions made and alternatives considered throughout the planning process. The responsible official shall make the planning record available at the office where the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision was developed.
[77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 81 FR 90738, Dec. 15, 2016]
§ 219.15
Project and activity consistency with the plan.
(a)
Application to existing authorizations and approved projects or activities.
Every decision document approving a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision must state whether authorizations of occupancy and use made before the decision document may proceed unchanged. If a plan decision document does not expressly allow such occupancy and use, the permit, contract, and other authorizing instrument for the use and occupancy must be made consistent with the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision as soon as practicable, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, subject to valid existing rights.
(b)
Application to projects or activities authorized after plan decision.
Projects and activities authorized after approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision must be consistent with the plan as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(c)
Resolving inconsistency.
When a proposed project or activity would not be consistent with the applicable plan components, the responsible official
shall take one of the following steps, subject to valid existing rights:
(1) Modify the proposed project or activity to make it consistent with the applicable plan components;
(2) Reject the proposal or terminate the project or activity;
(3) Amend the plan so that the project or activity will be consistent with the plan as amended; or
(4) Amend the plan contemporaneously with the approval of the project or activity so that the project or activity will be consistent with the plan as amended. This amendment may be limited to apply only to the project or activity.
(d)
Determining consistency.
Every project and activity must be consistent with the applicable plan components. A project or activity approval document must describe how the project or activity is consistent with applicable plan components developed or revised in conformance with this part by meeting the following criteria:
(1)
Goals, desired conditions, and objectives.
The project or activity contributes to the maintenance or attainment of one or more goals, desired conditions, or objectives, or does not foreclose the opportunity to maintain or achieve any goals, desired conditions, or objectives, over the long term.
(2)
Standards.
The project or activity complies with applicable standards.
(3)
Guidelines.
The project or activity:
(i) Complies with applicable guidelines as set out in the plan; or
(ii) Is designed in a way that is as effective in achieving the purpose of the applicable guidelines (§ 219.7(e)(1)(iv)).
(4)
Suitability.
A project or activity would occur in an area:
(i) That the plan identifies as suitable for that type of project or activity; or
(ii) For which the plan is silent with respect to its suitability for that type of project or activity.
(e)
Consistency of resource plans within the planning area with the land management plan.
Any resource plans (for example, travel management plans) developed by the Forest Service that apply to the resources or land areas within the planning area must be consistent with the plan components. Resource plans developed prior to plan decision must be evaluated for consistency with the plan and amended if necessary.
§ 219.16
Public notifications.
The following public notification requirements apply to plan development, amendment, or revision. Notifications may be combined where appropriate.
(a)
When formal public notification is required.
Public notification must be provided as follows:
(1) To initiate the development of a proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision;
(2) To invite comments on a proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, and associated environmental analysis. For a new plan, plan amendment, or a plan revision for which a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) is prepared, the comment period is at least 90 days, except for an amendment that applies only to one project or activity. For an amendment that applies only to one project or activity for which a draft EIS is prepared, the comment period is at least 45 days unless a different time period is required by law or regulation or authorized pursuant to 40 CFR 1506.10(d). For an amendment for which a draft EIS is not prepared, the comment period is at least 30 days;
(3) To begin the objection period for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§ 219.52);
(4) To approve a final plan, plan amendment, or plan revision; or
(5) To announce whenever a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision process initiated under the provisions of a previous planning regulation will be conformed to meet the provisions of this part (§ 219.17(b)(3)).
(b)
Project or activity plan amendments.
When a plan amendment is approved in a decision document approving a project or activity and the amendment applies only to the project or activity, the notification requirements of 36 CFR part 215 or part 218, subpart A, applies instead of this section.
(c)
How public notice is provided.
The responsible official should use contemporary tools to provide notice to the public. At a minimum, all public notifications required by this part must be posted online, and:
(1) When the Chief, the Under Secretary, or the Secretary is the responsible official, notice must be published in the
Federal Register.
(2) For a new plan or plan revision, when an official other than the Chief, the Under Secretary, or the Secretary is the responsible official, notice must be published in the
Federal Register
and the applicable newspaper(s) of record.
(3) When the notice is for the purpose of inviting comments on a proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision for which a draft EIS is prepared, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
Federal Register
notice of availability of a draft EIS shall serve as the required
Federal Register
notice.
(4) For a plan amendment when an official other than the Chief, the Under Secretary, or the Secretary is the responsible official, and for which a draft EIS is not prepared, notices must be published in the newspaper(s) of record.
(5) If a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision applies to two or more units, notices must be published in the
Federal Register
and the newspaper(s) of record for the applicable units.
(6) Additional public notice of administrative changes, changes to the monitoring program, opportunities to provide information for assessments, assessment reports, monitoring evaluation reports, or other notices not listed in paragraph (a) of this section may be made in any way the responsible official deems appropriate.
(d)
Content of public notices.
Public notices required by this section except for notices applicable to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, must clearly describe the action subject to notice and the nature and scope of the decisions to be made; identify the responsible official; describe when, where, and how the responsible official will provide opportunities for the public to participate in the planning process; and explain how to obtain additional information.

All plan amendments initiated after May 9, 2012, are subject to the objection process in subpart B of this part. With respect to plans approved or revised under a prior planning regulation, including the transition provisions of the reinstated 2000 rule (36 CFR part 219, published at 36 CFR parts 200 to 299, revised as of July 1, 2010), plan amendments may be initiated under the provisions of the prior planning regulation for 3 years after May 9, 2012, and may be completed and approved under those provisions (except for the optional appeal procedures of the prior planning regulation); or may be initiated, completed, and approved under the requirements of this part. After the 3-year transition period, all plan amendments must be initiated, completed, and approved under the requirements of this part.
(3)
Plan development, plan amendments, or plan revisions initiated before this part.
For plan development, plan amendments, or plan revisions that were initiated before May 9, 2012, the responsible official may complete and approve the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision in conformance with the provisions of the prior planning regulation, including its transition provisions
(36 CFR part 219, published at 36 CFR parts 200 to 299, revised as of July 1, 2010), or may conform the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision to the requirements of this part. If the responsible official chooses to complete an ongoing planning process under the provisions of the prior planning regulation, but chooses to allow for an objection rather than an administrative appeal, the objection process in subpart B of this part shall apply. When the responsible official chooses to conform an ongoing planning process to this part, public notice must be made (§ 219.16(a)(5)). An objection process may be chosen only if the public is provided the opportunity to comment on a proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, and associated environmental analysis.
(c)
Plans developed, amended, or revised under a prior planning regulation.
This part supersedes any prior planning regulation. No obligations remain from any prior planning regulation, except those that are specifically included in a unit's existing plan. Existing plans will remain in effect until revised. This part does not compel a change to any existing plan, except as required in § 219.12(c)(1). None of the requirements of this part apply to projects or activities on units with plans developed or revised under a prior planning rule until the plan is revised under this part, except that projects or activities on such units must comply with the consistency requirement of § 219.15 with respect to any amendments that are developed and approved pursuant to this part.

# Subpart B—Pre-Decisional Administrative Review Process
§ 219.50
Purpose and scope.
This subpart establishes a pre-decisional administrative review (hereinafter referred to as objection) process for plans, plan amendments, or plan revisions. This process gives an individual or entity an opportunity for an independent Forest Service review and resolution of issues before the approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision. This subpart identifies who may file objections to a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision; the responsibilities of the participants in an objection; and the procedures that apply to the review of the objection.
§ 219.51
Plans, plan amendments, or plan revisions not subject to objection.
(a) A plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is not subject to objection when the responsible official receives no substantive formal comments (§ 219.62) on that proposal during the opportunities for public comment (§ 219.53(a)).
(b) Plans, plan amendments, or plan revisions proposed by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment are not subject to the procedures set forth in this section. A decision by the Secretary or Under Secretary constitutes the final administrative determination of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
(c) A plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is not subject to objection under this subpart if another administrative review process is used consistent with § 219.59.
(d) When a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is not subject to objection under this subpart, the responsible official shall include an explanation with the signed decision document.
§ 219.52
Giving notice of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision subject to objection before approval.
(a) The responsible official shall disclose during the NEPA scoping process and in the appropriate NEPA documents that the proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is subject to the objection procedures in this subpart. This disclosure is in addition to the public notice that begins the objection filing period, as required at § 219.16. When a responsible official chooses to use the objection process of this subpart for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision process initiated before the effective date of this rule, notice that the objection process will
be used must be given prior to an opportunity to provide substantive formal comment on a proposed plan, plan amendment, or revision and associated environmental analysis.
(b) The responsible official shall make available the public notice for the beginning of the objection period for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision (§ 219.16(a)(3)) to those who have requested the environmental documents or are eligible to file an objection consistent with § 219.53.
(c) The content of the public notice for the beginning of the objection period for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§ 219.16(a)(3)) must:
(1) Inform the public of the availability of the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, the appropriate final environmental documents, the draft plan decision document, and any relevant assessment or monitoring evaluation report; the commencement of the objection filing period under 36 CFR part 219 Subpart B; and the process for objecting. The documents in this paragraph will be made available online at the time of public notice.
(2) Include the name of the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, the name and title of the responsible official, and instructions on how to obtain a copy of the appropriate final environmental documents; the draft plan decision document; and the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision.
(3) Include the name and address of the reviewing officer with whom an objection is to be filed. The notice must specify a street, postal, fax, and email address; the acceptable format(s) for objections filed electronically; and the reviewing officer's office business hours for those filing hand-delivered objections.
(4) Include a statement that objections will be accepted only from those who have previously submitted substantive formal comments specific to the proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision during any opportunity for public comment as provided in subpart A.
(5) Include a statement that the publication date of the public notice in the applicable newspaper of record (or the
Federal Register,
if the responsible official is the Chief) is the exclusive means for calculating the time to file an objection (§ 219.56).
(6) Include a statement that an objection, including attachments, must be filed with the appropriate reviewing officer (§ 219.62) within 60 days, if an environmental impact statement has been prepared, otherwise within 45 days of the date of publication of the public notice for the objection process.
(7) Include a statement describing the minimum content requirements of an objection (§ 219.54(c)).
§ 219.53
Who may file an objection.
(a) Individuals and entities who have submitted substantive formal comments related to a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision during the opportunities for public comment as provided in subpart A during the planning process for that decision may file an objection. Objections must be based on previously submitted substantive formal comments attributed to the objector unless the objection concerns an issue that arose after the opportunities for formal comment. The burden is on the objector to demonstrate compliance with requirements for objection. Objections that do not meet the requirements of this paragraph may not be accepted; however, objections not accepted must be documented in the planning record.
(b) Formal comments received from an authorized representative(s) of an entity are considered those of the entity only. Individual members of that entity do not meet objection eligibility requirements solely based on membership in an entity. A member or an individual must submit substantive formal comments independently to be eligible to file an objection in an individual capacity.
(c) When an objection lists multiple individuals or entities, each individual or entity must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Individuals or entities listed on an objection that do not meet eligibility requirements may not be considered objectors, although an objection must be accepted (if not otherwise set aside for review under § 219.55) if at least one listed individual or entity meets the eligibility requirements.
(d) Federal agencies may not file objections.
(e) Federal employees who otherwise meet the requirements of this subpart for filing objections in a non-official capacity must comply with Federal conflict of interest statutes at 18 U.S.C. 202-209 and with employee ethics requirements at 5 CFR part 2635. Specifically, employees may not be on official duty nor use government property or equipment in the preparation or filing of an objection. Further, employees may not include information unavailable to the public, such as Federal agency documents that are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)).

(7) A statement that demonstrates the link between prior substantive formal comments attributed to the objector and the content of the objection, unless the objection concerns an issue that arose after the opportunities for formal comment (§ 219.53(a)).
§ 219.55
Objections set aside from review.
(a) The reviewing officer shall set aside and not review an objection when one or more of the following applies:
(1) Objections are not filed in a timely manner (§ 219.56);
(2) The proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is not subject to the objection procedures of this subpart pursuant to §§ 219.51 and 219.59;
(3) The individual or entity did not submit substantive formal comments (§ 219.53) during opportunities for public comment on the proposed decision (§ 219.16(a)(1) and (a)(2));
(4) None of the issues included in the objection is based on previously submitted substantive formal comments unless one or more of those issues arose after the opportunities for formal comment;
(5) The objection does not provide sufficient information as required by § 219.54(c);
(6) The objector withdraws the objection in writing;
(7) The objector's identity is not provided or cannot be determined from the signature (written or electronically
scanned), and a reasonable means of contact is not provided (§ 219.54(c)); or
(8) The objection is illegible for any reason and a legible copy cannot easily be obtained.
(b) When an objection includes an issue that is not based on previously submitted substantive formal comments and did not arise after the opportunities for formal comment, that issue will be set aside and not reviewed. Other issues raised in the objection that meet the requirements of this subpart will be reviewed.
(c) The reviewing officer shall give written notice to the objector and the responsible official when an objection or part of an objection is set aside from review and shall state the reasons for not reviewing the objection in whole or part. If the objection is set aside from review for reasons of illegibility or lack of a means of contact, the reasons must be documented in the planning record.
§ 219.56
Objection time periods and process.
(a)
Time to file an objection.
For a new plan, plan amendment, or plan revision for which an environmental impact statement (EIS) is prepared, written objections, including any attachments, must be filed within 60 days following the publication date of the public notice for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§§ 219.16 and 219.52). For an amendment for which an EIS is not prepared, the time to file an objection is within 45 days. It is the responsibility of the objector to ensure that the reviewing officer receives the objection in a timely manner.
(b)
Computation of time periods.
(1) All time periods are computed using calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays in the time zone of the reviewing officer. However, when the time period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time is extended to the end of the next Federal working day (11:59 p.m. for objections filed by electronic means such as email or facsimile machine).
(2) The day after publication of the public notice for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§§ 219.16 and 219.52), is the first day of the objection filing period.
(3) The publication date of the public notice for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§§ 219.16 and 219.52), is the exclusive means for calculating the time to file an objection. Objectors may not rely on dates or timeframe information provided by any other source.
(c)
Evidence of timely filing.
The objector is responsible for filing the objection in a timely manner. Timeliness must be determined by one of the following indicators:
(1) The date of the U.S. Postal Service postmark for an objection received before the close of the fifth business day after the objection filing date;
(2) The electronically generated posted date and time for email and facsimiles;
(3) The shipping date for delivery by private carrier for an objection received before the close of the fifth business day after the objection filing date; or
(4) The official agency date stamp showing receipt of hand delivery.
(d)
Extensions.
Time extensions for filing are not permitted except as provided at paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(e)
Reviewing officer role and responsibilities.
The reviewing officer is the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or Forest Service official having the delegated authority and responsibility to review an objection filed under this subpart. The reviewing officer is a line officer at the next higher administrative level above the responsible official; except that:
(1) For a plan amendment, that next higher-level line officer may delegate the reviewing officer authority and responsibility to a line officer at the same administrative level as the responsible official. Any plan amendment delegation of reviewing officer responsibilities must be made prior to the public notification of an objection filing period (§ 219.52).
(2) For an objection or part of an objection specific to the identification of species of conservation concern, the regional forester who identified the species of conservation concern for the
plan area may not be the reviewing officer. The Chief may choose to act as the reviewing officer or may delegate the reviewing officer authority to a line officer at the same administrative level as the regional forester. The reviewing officer for the plan will convey any such objections or parts thereof to the appropriate line officer.
(f)
Notice of objections filed.
Within 10 days after the close of the objection period, the responsible official shall publish a notice of all objections in the applicable newspaper of record and post the notice online.
(g)
Response to objections.
The reviewing officer must issue a written response to the objector(s) concerning their objection(s) within 90 days of the end of the objection-filing period. The reviewing officer has the discretion to extend the time when it is determined to be necessary to provide adequate response to objections or to participate in discussions with the parties. The reviewing officer must notify all parties (lead objectors and interested persons) in writing of any extensions.
§ 219.57
Resolution of objections.
(a)
Meetings.
Prior to the issuance of the reviewing officer's written response, either the reviewing officer or the objector may request to meet to discuss issues raised in the objection and potential resolution. The reviewing officer must allow other interested persons to participate in such meetings. An interested person must file a request to participate in an objection within 10 days after publication of the notice of objection by the responsible official (§ 219.56(f)). The responsible official shall be a participant in all meetings involving the reviewing officer, objectors, and interested persons. During meetings with objectors and interested persons, the reviewing officer may choose to use alternative dispute resolution methods to resolve objections. All meetings are open to observation by the public.
(b)
Response to objections.
(1) The reviewing officer must render a written response to the objection(s) within 90 days of the close of the objection-filing period, unless the allowable time is extended as provided at § 219.56(g). A written response must set forth the reasons for the response but need not be a point-by-point response, and may contain instructions to the responsible official. In cases involving more than one objection to a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, the reviewing officer may consolidate objections and issue one or more responses. The response must be sent to the objecting party(ies) by certified mail, return receipt requested, and posted online.
(2) The reviewing officer's review of and response to the objection(s) is limited to only those issues and concerns submitted in the objection(s).
(3) The response of the reviewing officer will be the final decision of the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the objection.
§ 219.58
Timing of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision decision.
(a) The responsible official may not issue a decision document concerning a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision subject to the provisions of this subpart until the reviewing officer has responded in writing to all objections.
(b) A decision by the responsible official approving a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision must be consistent with the reviewing officer's response to objections.
(c) When no objection is filed within the allotted filing period, the reviewing officer must notify the responsible official. The responsible official's approval of the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision in a plan decision document consistent with § 219.14, may occur on, but not before, the fifth business day following the end of the objection-filing period.
§ 219.59
Use of other administrative review processes.
(a) Where the Forest Service is a participant in a multi-federal agency effort that would otherwise be subject to objection under this subpart, the responsible official may waive the objection procedures of this subpart and instead adopt the administrative review procedure of another participating Federal agency. As a condition of such a waiver, the responsible official for the Forest Service must have agreement with the responsible official of the other agency or agencies that a
joint agency response will be provided to those who file for administrative review of the multi-agency effort. When such an agreement is reached, the responsible official for the Forest Service shall ensure public notice required in § 219.52 sets forth which administrative review procedure is to be used.
(b) When a plan amendment is approved in a decision document approving a project or activity and the amendment applies only to the project or activity, the administrative review process of 36 CFR part 215 or part 218, subpart A, applies instead of the objection process established in this subpart. When a plan amendment applies to all future projects or activities, the objection process established in this subpart applies only to the plan amendment decision; the review process of 36 CFR part 215 or part 218 would apply to the project or activity part of the decision.
§ 219.60
Secretary's authority.
Nothing in this subpart restricts the Secretary of Agriculture from exercising any statutory authority regarding the protection, management, or administration of NFS lands.
§ 219.61
Information collection requirements.
This subpart specifies the information that objectors must give in an objection to a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision (§ 219.54(c)). As such, this subpart contains information collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320 and have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned control number 0596-0158.

§ 220.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
This part establishes Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) procedures for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321
et seq.
) and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508).
(b)
Scope.
This part supplements and does not lessen the applicability of the CEQ regulations, and is to be used in conjunction with the CEQ regulations and USDA regulations at 7 CFR part 1b.
§ 220.2
Applicability.
This part applies to all organizational elements of the Forest Service. Consistent with 40 CFR 1500.3, no trivial violation of this part shall give rise to any independent cause of action.
§ 220.3
Definitions.
The following definitions supplement, by adding to, the terms defined at 40 CFR parts 1500-1508.
Adaptive management.
A system of management practices based on clearly identified intended outcomes and monitoring to determine if management actions are meeting those outcomes; and, if not, to facilitate management changes that will best ensure that those outcomes are met or re-evaluated. Adaptive management stems from the recognition that knowledge about natural resource systems is sometimes uncertain.
Decision document.
A record of decision, decision notice or decision memo.
Decision memo.
A concise written record of the responsible official's decision to implement an action categorically excluded from further analysis and documentation in an environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA).
Decision notice.
A concise written record of the responsible official's decision when an EA and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) have been prepared.
Environmentally preferable alternative.
The environmentally preferable alternative is the alternative that will best promote the national environmental policy as expressed in NEPA's section 101 (42 U.S.C. 4321). Ordinarily, the environmentally preferable alternative is that which causes the least harm to the biological and physical environment; it also is the alternative which best protects and preserves historic, cultural, and natural resources. In some situations, there may be more than one environmentally preferable alternative.
Reasonably foreseeable future actions.
Those Federal or non-Federal activities not yet undertaken, for which there are existing decisions, funding, or identified proposals. Identified proposals for Forest Service actions are described in § 220.4(a)(1).
Responsible official.
The Agency employee who has the authority to make and implement a decision on a proposed action.
Schedule of proposed actions (SOPA).
A Forest Service document that informs the public about those proposed and ongoing Forest Service actions for which a record of decision, decision notice or decision memo would be or has been prepared. The SOPA also identifies a contact for additional information on any proposed actions.
§ 220.4
General requirements.
(a)
Proposed actions subject to the NEPA requirements.
As required by 42 U.S.C. 4321
et seq.,
a Forest Service proposal is subject to the NEPA requirements when all of the following apply:
(1) The Forest Service has a goal and is actively preparing to make a decision on one or more alternative means of accomplishing that goal and the effects can be meaningfully evaluated (
see
40 CFR 1508.23);
(2) The proposed action is subject to Forest Service control and responsibility (
see
40 CFR 1508.18);
(3) The proposed action would cause effects on the natural and physical environment and the relationship of people with that environment (
see
40 CFR 1508.14); and
(4) The proposed action is not statutorily exempt from the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).
(b)
Emergency responses.
When the responsible official determines that an emergency exists that makes it necessary to take urgently needed actions before preparing a NEPA analysis and any required documentation in accordance with the provisions in §§ 220.5, 220.6, and 220.7 of this part, then the following provisions apply.
(1) The responsible official may take actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency and are urgently needed to mitigate harm to life, property, or important natural or cultural resources. When taking such actions, the responsible official shall take into account the probable environmental consequences of the emergency action and mitigate foreseeable adverse environmental effects to the extent practical.
(2) If the responsible official proposes emergency actions other than those actions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and such actions are not likely to have significant environmental impacts, the responsible official shall document that determination in an EA and FONSI prepared in accord with these regulations. If the responsible official finds that the nature and scope of proposed emergency actions are such that they must be undertaken prior to preparing any NEPA analysis and documentation associated with a CE or an EA and FONSI, the responsible official shall consult with the Washington Office about alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance. The Chief or Associate Chief of the Forest Service may grant emergency alternative arrangements under NEPA for environmental assessments, findings of no significant impact and categorical exclusions (FSM 1950.41a). Consultation with the Washington Office shall be coordinated through the appropriate regional office.
(3) If the responsible official proposes emergency actions other than those actions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and such actions are likely
to have significant environmental impacts, then the responsible official shall consult with CEQ, through the appropriate regional office and the Washington Office, about alternative arrangements in accordance with CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 1506.11 as soon as possible.
(c)
Agency decisionmaking.
For each Forest Service proposal (§ 220.4(a)), the responsible official shall coordinate and integrate NEPA review and relevant environmental documents with agency decisionmaking by:
(1) Completing the environmental document review before making a decision on the proposal;
(2) Considering environmental documents, public and agency comments (if any) on those documents, and agency responses to those comments;
(3) Including environmental documents, comments, and responses in the administrative record;
(4) Considering the alternatives analyzed in environmental document(s) before rendering a decision on the proposal; and
(5) Making a decision encompassed within the range of alternatives analyzed in the environmental documents.
(d)
Schedule of proposed actions (SOPA).
The responsible official shall ensure the SOPA is updated and notify the public of the availability of the SOPA.
(e)
Scoping (40 CFR 1501.7).
(1) Scoping is required for all Forest Service proposed actions, including those that would appear to be categorically excluded from further analysis and documentation in an EA or an EIS (§ 220.6).
(2) Scoping shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.7. Because the nature and complexity of a proposed action determine the scope and intensity of analysis, no single scoping technique is required or prescribed.
(3) The SOPA shall not to be used as the sole scoping mechanism for a proposed action.
(f)
Cumulative effects considerations of past actions.
Cumulative effects analysis shall be carried out in accordance with 40 CFR 1508.7 and in accordance with “The Council on Environmental Quality Guidance Memorandum on Consideration of Past Actions in Cumulative Effects Analysis” dated June 24, 2005. The analysis of cumulative effects begins with consideration of the direct and indirect effects on the environment that are expected or likely to result from the alternative proposals for agency action. Agencies then look for present effects of past actions that are, in the judgment of the agency, relevant and useful because they have a significant cause-and-effect relationship with the direct and indirect effects of the proposal for agency action and its alternatives. CEQ regulations do not require the consideration of the individual effects of all past actions to determine the present effects of past actions. Once the agency has identified those present effects of past actions that warrant consideration, the agency assesses the extent that the effects of the proposal for agency action or its alternatives will add to, modify, or mitigate those effects. The final analysis documents an agency assessment of the cumulative effects of the actions considered (including past, present, and reasonable foreseeable future actions) on the affected environment. With respect to past actions, during the scoping process and subsequent preparation of the analysis, the agency must determine what information regarding past actions is useful and relevant to the required analysis of cumulative effects. Cataloging past actions and specific information about the direct and indirect effects of their design and implementation could in some contexts be useful to predict the cumulative effects of the proposal. The CEQ regulations, however, do not require agencies to catalogue or exhaustively list and analyze all individual past actions. Simply because information about past actions may be available or obtained with reasonable effort does not mean that it is relevant and necessary to inform decisionmaking. (40 CFR 1508.7)
(g)
Classified information.
To the extent practicable, the responsible official shall segregate any information that has been classified pursuant to Executive order or statute. The responsible official shall maintain the confidentiality of such information in a manner required for the information involved. Such information may not be
included in any publicly disclosed documents. If such material cannot be reasonably segregated, or if segregation would leave essentially meaningless material, the responsible official must withhold the entire analysis document from the public; however, the responsible official shall otherwise prepare the analysis documentation in accord with applicable regulations. (40 CFR 1507.3(c))
(h)
Incorporation by reference.
Material may be incorporated by reference into any environmental or decision document. This material must be reasonably available to the public and its contents briefly described in the environmental or decision document. (40 CFR 1502.21)
(i)
Applicants.
The responsible official shall make policies or staff available to advise potential applicants of studies or other information foreseeably required for acceptance of their applications. Upon acceptance of an application as provided by 36 CFR 251.54(g) the responsible official shall initiate the NEPA process.
(j)
Determination of NEPA Adequacy (DNA).
(1) An existing environmental analysis prepared pursuant to NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality regulations may be used in its entirety for a new proposed action if the Responsible Official determines that the existing NEPA analysis adequately assesses the environmental effects of the proposed action and reasonable alternatives. The responsible official must determine and document that each of the following elements is met:
(i) The new proposed action is substantially the same as a previously analyzed proposed action or alternative analyzed in detail in the existing NEPA analysis.
(ii) The range of alternatives analyzed in the existing NEPA document(s) is appropriate with respect to the new proposed action.
(iii) Any new information or circumstances relevant to environmental concerns would not substantially change the analysis in an existing NEPA document(s).
(iv) The environmental effects that would result from implementation of the new proposed action are similar to those analyzed in the existing NEPA document(s).
(2) A DNA for a new proposed action shall be included in the project record for the new proposed action. Proposed actions undergoing a DNA review shall:
(i) Be included on the SOPA;
(ii) Be subject to scoping;
(iii) Be subject to pre-decisional administrative review, if applicable; and
(iv) Include issuance of a new decision document (decision memo, decision notice, or record of decision) when approved.
[73 FR 43093, July 24, 2008, as amended at 85 FR 73630, Nov. 19, 2020]
§ 220.5
Environmental impact statement and record of decision.
(a)
Classes of actions normally requiring environmental impact statements
—(1)
Class 1:
Proposals to carry out or to approve aerial application of chemical pesticides on an operational basis. Examples include but are not limited to:
(i) Applying chemical insecticides by helicopter on an area infested with spruce budworm to prevent serious resource loss.
(ii) Authorizing the application of herbicides by helicopter on a major utility corridor to control unwanted vegetation.
(iii) Applying herbicides by fixed-wing aircraft on an area to release trees from competing vegetation.
(2)
Class 2:
Proposals that would substantially alter the undeveloped character of an inventoried roadless area or a potential wilderness area. Examples include but are not limited to:
(i) Constructing roads and harvesting timber in an inventoried roadless area where the proposed road and harvest units impact a substantial part of the inventoried roadless area.
(ii) Constructing or reconstructing water reservoir facilities in a potential wilderness area where flow regimens may be substantially altered.
(iii) Approving a plan of operations for a mine that would cause considerable surface disturbance in a potential wilderness area.
(b)
Notice of intent.
Normally, a notice of intent to prepare an EIS shall be published in the
Federal Register
as soon as practicable after deciding that an EIS will be prepared. Where there is
a lengthy period between the agency's decision to prepare an environmental impact statement and the time of actual preparation, the notice of intent may be published at a reasonable time in advance of preparation of the draft statement. A notice must meet the requirements of 40 CFR 1508.22, and in addition, include the following:
(1) Title of the responsible official(s);
(2) Any permits or licenses required to implement the proposed action and the issuing authority;
(3) Lead, joint lead, or cooperating agencies if identified; and
(4) Address(es) to which comments may be sent.
(c)
Withdrawal notice.
A withdrawal notice must be published in the
Federal Register
if, after publication of the notice of intent or notice of availability, an EIS is no longer necessary. A withdrawal notice must refer to the date and
Federal Register
page number of the previously published notice(s).
(d)
Environmental impact statement format and content.
The responsible official may use any EIS format and design as long as the statement is in accord with 40 CFR 1502.10.
(e)
Alternative(s).
The EIS shall document the examination of reasonable alternatives to the proposed action. An alternative should meet the purpose and need and address one or more significant issues related to the proposed action. Since an alternative may be developed to address more than one significant issue, no specific number of alternatives is required or prescribed. The following procedures are available to the responsible official to develop and analyze alternatives:
(1) The responsible official may modify the proposed action and alternative(s) under consideration prior to issuing a draft EIS. In such cases, the responsible official may consider the incremental changes as alternatives considered. The documentation of these incremental changes to a proposed action or alternatives shall be included or incorporated by reference in accord with 40 CFR 1502.21.
(2) The proposed action and one or more alternatives to the proposed action may include adaptive management. An adaptive management proposal or alternative must clearly identify the adjustment(s) that may be made when monitoring during project implementation indicates that the action is not having its intended effect, or is causing unintended and undesirable effects. The EIS must disclose not only the effect of the proposed action or alternative but also the effect of the adjustment. Such proposal or alternative must also describe the monitoring that would take place to inform the responsible official during implementation whether the action is having its intended effect.
(f)
Circulating and filing draft and final environmental impact statements.
(1) The draft and final EISs shall be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Federal Activities in Washington, DC (
see
40 CFR 1506.9).
(2) Requirements at 40 CFR 1506.9 “Filing requirements,” 40 CFR 1506.10 “Timing of agency action,” and 40 CFR 1502.19 “Circulation of the environmental impact statement” shall only apply to the last draft and final EIS and not apply to material produced prior to the draft EIS or between the draft and final EIS which are filed with EPA.
(3) When the responsible official determines that an extension of the review period on a draft EIS is appropriate, notice shall be given in the same manner used for inviting comments on the draft.
(g)
Distribution of the record of decision.
The responsible official shall notify interested or affected parties of the availability of the record of decision as soon as practical after signing.
§ 220.6
Categorical exclusions.
(a)
General.
A proposed action may be categorically excluded from further analysis and documentation in an EIS or EA only if there are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposed action and if:
(1) The proposed action is within one of the categories established by the Secretary at 7 CFR part 1b.3; or
(2) The proposed action is within a category listed in § 220.6(d) and (e).
(b)
Resource conditions.
(1) Resource conditions that should be considered in
determining whether extraordinary circumstances related to a proposed action warrant further analysis and documentation in an EA or an EIS are:
(i) Federally listed threatened or endangered species or designated critical habitat, species proposed for Federal listing or proposed critical habitat, or Forest Service sensitive species;
(ii) Flood plains, wetlands, or municipal watersheds;
(iii) Congressionally designated areas, such as wilderness, wilderness study areas, or national recreation areas;
(iv) Inventoried roadless area or potential wilderness area;
(v) Research natural areas;
(vi) American Indians and Alaska Native religious or cultural sites; and
(vii) Archaeological sites, or historic properties or areas.
(2) The mere presence of one or more of these resource conditions does not preclude use of a categorical exclusion (CE). It is the existence of a cause-effect relationship between a proposed action and the potential effect on these resource conditions, and if such a relationship exists, the degree of the potential effect of a proposed action on these resource conditions that determines whether extraordinary circumstances exist.
(c)
Scoping.
If the responsible official determines, based on scoping, that it is uncertain whether the proposed action may have a significant effect on the environment, prepare an EA. If the responsible official determines, based on scoping, that the proposed action may have a significant environmental effect, prepare an EIS.
(d)
Categories of actions for which a project or case file and decision memo are not required.
A supporting record and a decision memo are not required, but at the discretion of the responsible official, may be prepared for the following categories:
(1) Orders issued pursuant to 36 CFR part 261—Prohibitions to provide short-term resource protection or to protect public health and safety. Examples include but are not limited to:
(i) Closing a road to protect bighorn sheep during lambing season, and
(ii) Closing an area during a period of extreme fire danger.

(9) Issuance of a new permit for up to the maximum tenure allowable under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b) for an existing ski area when such issuance is a purely ministerial action to account for administrative changes, such as a change in ownership of ski area improvements, expiration of the current permit, or a change in the statutory authority applicable to the current permit. Examples include, but are not limited to:
(i) Issuing a permit to a new owner of ski area improvements within an existing ski area with no changes to the master development plan, including no changes to the facilities or activities for that ski area;
(ii) Upon expiration of a ski area permit, issuing a new permit to the holder of the previous permit where the holder is not requesting any changes to the master development plan, including changes to the facilities or activities; and
(iii) Issuing a new permit under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 to the holder of a permit issued under the Term Permit and Organic Acts, where there are no changes in the type or scope of activities authorized and no other changes in the master development plan.
(10) [Reserved]
(11) Issuance of a new special use authorization to replace an existing or expired special use authorization, when such issuance is to account only for administrative changes, such as a change in ownership of authorized improvements or expiration of the current authorization, and where there are no changes to the authorized facilities or increases in the scope or magnitude of authorized activities. The applicant or holder must be in compliance with all the terms and conditions of the existing or expired special use authorization. Subject to the foregoing conditions, examples include but are not limited to:

§ 222.2
Management of the range environment.
(a) Allotments will be designated on the National Forest System and on other lands under Forest Service control where the land is available for grazing. Associated private and other public lands should, but only with the consent of the landowner, lessee, or agency, be considered in such designations to form logical range management units.
(b) Each allotment will be analyzed and with careful and considered consultation and cooperation with the affected permittees, landowners, and grazing advisory boards involved, as well as the State having land within the area covered, and an allotment management plan developed. The plan will then be approved and implemented. The analysis and plan will be updated as needed.
(c) Forage producing National Forest System lands will be managed for livestock grazing and the allotment management plans will be prepared consistent with land management plans.

§ 222.3
Issuance of grazing and livestock use permits.
(a) Unless otherwise specified by the Chief, Forest Service, all grazing and livestock use on National Forest System lands and on other lands under Forest Service control must be authorized by a grazing or livestock use permit.
(b) Grazing permits and livestock use permits convey no right, title, or interest held by the United States in any lands or resources.
(c) The Chief, Forest Service, is authorized to issue permits for livestock grazing and other use by livestock of the National Forest System and on other lands under Forest Service control as follows:
(1) Grazing permits with priority for renewal may be issued as follows: On National Forests in the 16 contiguous western States 10-year term permits will be issued unless the land is pending disposal, or will be devoted to other uses prior to the end of ten years, or it will be in the best interest of sound land management to specify a shorter term. On National Forest System lands other than National Forests in the 16 contiguous western States, the permit term shall be for periods of 10 years or less. Term grazing permits for periods of 10 years or less in the form of grazing agreements may be issued to cooperative grazing associations or similar organizations incorporated or otherwise established pursuant to State law. Such an agreement will make National Forest System lands and improvements available to the association for grazing in accordance with provisions of the grazing agreement and Forest Service policies. Term permits authorized in this paragraph may be in the form of private land or on-and-off grazing permits where the person is qualified to hold such permits under provisions the Chief may require. Permits issued under this paragraph are subject to the following:
(i) Except as provided for by the Chief, Forest Service, paid term permits will be issued to persons who own livestock to be grazed and such base property as may be required, provided the land is determined to be available for grazing purposes by the Chief, Forest Service, and the capacity exists to graze specified numbers of animals.
(ii) A term permit holder has first priority for receipt of a new permit at the end of the term period provided he has fully complied with the terms and conditions of the expiring permit.
(iii) In order to update terms and conditions, term permits may be cancelled at the end of the calendar year of the midyear of the decade (1985, 1995, etc.), provided they are reissued to the existing permit holder for a new term of 10 years.
(iv) New term permits may be issued to the purchaser of a permittee's permitted livestock and/or base property, provided the permittee waives his term permit to the United States and provided the purchaser is otherwise eligible and qualified.
(v) If the permittee chooses to dispose of all or part of his base property or permitted livestock (not under approved nonuse) but does not choose to waive his term permit, the Forest Supervisor will give written notice that he no longer is qualified to hold a permit, provided he is given up to one year to reestablish his qualifications before cancellation action is final.
(vi) The Chief, Forest Service, shall prescribe provisions and requirements under which term permits will be issued, renewed, and administered, including:
(A) The amount and character of base property and livestock the permit holder shall be required to own.
(B) Specifying the period of the year the base property shall be capable of supporting permitted livestock.
(C) Acquisition of base property and/or permitted livestock.
(D) Conditions for the approval of nonuse of permit for specified periods.
(E) Upper and special limits governing the total number of livestock for which a person is entitled to hold a permit.

(D) To allow a person to continue to graze livestock for the remainder of the grazing season where base property has been sold, the permit waived, and a new term permit issued.
(E) To allow grazing use in the event of drought or other emergency of National or Regional scope where such use would not result in permanent resource damage.
(ii) Livestock use permits for not to exceed one year may be issued under terms and conditions prescribed by the Chief, Forest Service, as follows:
(A) Paid permits for transportation livestock to persons engaged in commercial packing, dude ranching, or other commercial enterprises which involve transportation livestock including mining, ranching, and logging, activities.
(B) Paid or free permits for research purposes and administrative studies.
(C) Paid or free permits to trail livestock across National Forest System lands.
(D) Free permits to persons who reside on ranch or agricultural lands within or contiguous to National Forest System lands for not to exceed 10 head of livestock owned or kept and whose products are consumed or whose services are used directly by the family of the resident, and who distinctly need such National Forest System lands to support such animals.
(E) Free permits to campers and travelers for the livestock actually used during the period of occupancy. This may be authorized without written permit.
(F) Paid or free permits for horses, mules, or burros to persons who clearly need National Forest System land to support the management of permitted livestock.
(G) Free permits for horses, mules, or burros to cooperators who clearly need National Forest System land to support research, administration or other work being conducted. This may be authorized without written permit.

§ 222.50
General procedures.
(a) Fees shall be charged for all livestock grazing or livestock use of National Forest system lands, or other lands under Forest Service control. An exception is livestock authorized free of charge under provisions of § 222.3(c)(2)(ii) (B) through (G).
(b) Guiding establishment of fees are the law and general governmental policy as established by Bureau of the Budget (now, Office of Management and Budget) Circular A-25 of September 23, 1959, which directs that a fair market value be obtained for all services and resources provided the public through establishment of a system of reasonable fee charges, and that the users be afford equitable treatment. This policy precludes a monetary consideration in the fee structure for any permit value that may be capitalized into the permit holder's private ranching operation.
(c) A grazing fee shall be charged for each head month of livestock grazing or use. A head month is a month's use and occupancy of range by one animal, except for sheep or goats. A full head month's fee is charged for a month of grazing by adult animals; if the grazing animal is weaned or 6 months of age or older at the time of entering National Forest System lands; or will become 12 months of age during the permitted period of use. For fee purposes 5 sheep or goats, weaned or adult, are equivalent to one cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, or mule.
(d) No additional charge will be made for the privilege of lambing upon National Forest System lands, or other lands under Forest Service control.
(e) Transportation livestock may be charged for at a special rate, and at a minimum established for such use.
Fees for horses, mules, or burros associated with management of permitted livestock on an allotment, or for research purposes and administrative studies, and authorized on a charge basis, are determined under provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
(f) The fees for trailing livestock across National Forest System lands will conform with the rates established for other livestock. Where practicable, fees for trailing permitted livestock will be covered in the regular grazing fee and the crossing period covered in the regular grazing period.
(g) All fees for livestock grazing or livestock use of National Forest System lands or other lands under Forest Service control are payable in advance of the opening date of the grazing period, entry, or livestock use unless otherwise authorized by the Chief, Forest Service.
(h) The excess and unauthorized grazing use rate will be determined by establishing a base value without giving consideration for those contributions normally made by the permittee under terms of the grazing permit. This rate is charged for unauthorized forage or forage in excess of authorized use and is separate from any penalties that may be assessed for a violation of a prohibition issued under 36 CFR part 261 or from an administrative permit action. This rate will apply to, but not be limited to, the following circumstances: excess number of livestock grazed; livestock grazed outside the permitted grazing season; livestock grazed in areas not authorized under a grazing permit and a bill for collection; or livestock grazed without a permit. Per paragraph (a) of this section, a grazing fee shall be charged for each head month of livestock grazing or use. This includes any excess or unauthorized grazing use. The authorized officer may then waive monetary fees for excess or unauthorized grazing use only when all three of the following conditions are met:
(1) The excess or unauthorized use was a result of unforeseen or uncontrollable circumstances on behalf of the permittee or non-permittee, and the livestock associated with such use were removed by the permittee or non-permittee within the timeframe required by the authorized officer;
(2) The forage consumed by the excess or unauthorized use is not significant; and
(3) National Forest System lands have not been damaged significantly by the excess or unauthorized use.
(i) Refunds or credits may be allowed under justifiable conditions and circumstances as the Chief, Forest Service, may specify.
(j) The fee year for the purpose of charging grazing fees will be March 1 through the following February.
(k) The data year for the purpose of collecting beef cattle price data for computing indexes will be November 1 through the following October and apply to the following fee year.

§ 222.51
National Forests in 16 Western States.
(a) Grazing fees are established on lands designated National Forests and Land Utilization Projects in the 16 contiguous Western States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. (National Grasslands are excluded, see § 222.52.)
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 222.50, paragraph (b), the calculated grazing fee for 1988 and subsequent grazing fee years represents the economic value of the use of the land to the user and is the product of multiplying the base fair market value of $1.23 by the result of the annual Forage Value Index, added to the sum of the Beef Cattle Price Index minus the Prices Paid Index and divided by 100; provided, that the annual increase or decrease in such fee for any given year shall be limited to not more than plus or minus 25 percent of the previous year's fee, and provided further, that the fee shall not be less than $1.35 per head per month. The indexes used in this formula are as follows:
(1) Forage Value Index means the weighted average estimate of the annual rental charge per head per month
for pasturing cattle on private rangelands in the 11 Western States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) (computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) from the June Enumerative Survey) divided by $3.65 per head month and multiplied by 100;
(2) Beef Cattle Price Index means the weighted average annual selling price for beef cattle (excluding calves) in the 11 Western States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) (computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) for November through October (computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) divided by $22.04 per hundred weight and multiplied by 100; and
(3) Prices Paid Index means the following selected components from the National Agricultural Statistics Service “Annual National Index of Prices Paid by Farmers for Goods and Services” adjusted by the weights indicated in parentheses to reflect livestock production costs in the Western States:
1. Fuels and Energy (14.5);
2. Farm and Motor Supplies (12.0);
3. Autos and Trucks (4.5);
4. Tractors and Self-Propelled Machinery (4.5);
5. Other Machinery (12.0);
6. Building and Fencing Materials (14.5);
7. Interest (6.0);
8. Farm Wage Rates (14.0);
9. Farm Services (18.0).

§ 222.53
Grazing fees in the East—noncompetitive procedures.
(a)
Scope.
Except as provided in § 222.54 of this subpart, the fee charged for commercial livestock grazing use and occupancy on National Forest System (NFS) lands in the States of New York, Missouri, Vermont, West Virginia, and in the Southern Region shall be determined through noncompetitive, fair market value procedures. These rules do not apply to grazing fees on National Forest System lands in Oklahoma or National Grasslands in Texas. Grazing permits under the noncompetitive fee method in the East are subject to the rules governing grazing permit administration in Subpart A of this part.
(b)
Applicability.
The rules of this section apply to the establishment of grazing fees for existing permittees in the Eastern and Southern Regions on National Forest System lands, including grazing associations in New York and Missouri as of March 1, 1990, to any livestock on-and-off permits defined in Subpart A of this part; and to any allotments advertised for competitive bidding which were not bid on (§ 222.54(h)). Noncompetitive permits vacated or terminated by an existing permittee and any new allotments created after the effective date of this rule shall be offered on a competitive bid basis as specified in § 222.54 of this subpart. As provided in subpart A of this part, holders of term permits have first priority for receipt of a new permit.
(c)
Fee System.
The grazing fee charged under this section shall be based on fair market value, as determined by: Using comparable private grazing lease rates, adjusted for the difference in the costs of grazing comparable private leased lands and National Forest System lands, or by reference to prevailing prices in competitive markets for other Federal or State leased grazing lands that are the same or substantially similar to grazing lands offered or administered by the Forest Service in the East with comparability adjustments as appropriate. Comparable grazing lease rates shall be adjusted for the difference between the total costs of operating on leased grazing lands and the total costs (other than grazing fee costs) of operating on National Forest System lands.
(1)
Establishing Base Grazing Value.
(i) The Chief of the Forest Service, or an authorized officer to whom such authority has been delegated, shall determine an estimated base market value of grazing use and occupancy on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States for the following designated subregions:
(A) Corn Belt (Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio);
(B) Lake States (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin);
(C) Northeast (Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont);
(D) Appalachia (Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia);
(E) Southeast/Delta (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas); and
(F) Florida.
(ii) The Chief or authorized officer shall revise or update estimated market values of grazing use and occupancy, as necessary to respond to significant changes in the agricultural economy in the East, and to ensure that fees represent fair market value.
(iii) The Chief, or an authorized officer to whom authority has been delegated, where sufficient market data exist, may establish the base grazing value for grazing allotments using comparable, local lease rates for private grazing lands.
(2)
Annual Adjustment of Base Grazing Value.
To maintain currency with the private grazing lease market, the respective base grazing value(s) established for grazing permits under this section shall be annually adjusted through a hay price index, by respective subregion. The hay price index means the weighted average selling price of “other baled hay,” computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, by designated State and subregion. This index shall be based on 3-year average hay prices and annually reflect the percentage change in the cost of alternative livestock feed.
(3)
Computation of Annual Grazing Fee
—(i)
Annual Fee Basis.
The annual grazing fee shall equal the base grazing value, adjusted by the current period's hay price index, less the value of any agency required range improvements.
(ii)
Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements.
Any requirements for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource management plan and allotment management plan. These improvements must involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the grazing permit, must be of tangible public benefit, and must enhance management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements specified in allotment management planning documents or the grazing permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.
(4)
Implementation.
The grazing fee formula provided by this section shall be used to calculate fees for the 1990 grazing fee year. Where implementation would raise fees, the increase shall be phased in over a 5-year period. Full fair market value will be reached in 5 years, beginning in 1990.

§ 222.54
Grazing fees in the East—competitive bidding.
(a)
General Procedures
—(1)
Applicability.
The rules of this section apply to grazing fees for any allotment established or vacated on National Forest System lands in the Eastern or Southern Regions, as of February 26, 1990 as well as to grazing fees for existing allotments for such lands that have already been established under competitive procedures as of the date of this rule. Permits offered for competitive bidding in the East are subject to the rules governing grazing permit administration in subpart A of this part. The rules of this section do not apply to negotiated livestock use permits or permits with on-and-off grazing provisions as authorized in subpart A of this part. Holders of term permits have first priority for receipt of a new term grazing permit in accordance with subpart A of this part. These rules also do not apply
to grazing fees on National Forest System lands in Oklahoma or National Grasslands in Texas.
(2)
Allowable Bidders.
Bids for grazing permits shall be accepted from individuals, partnerships, grazing associations (formed after February 26, 1990), joint ventures, corporations, and organizations.
(b)
Establishment of Minimum Bid Price.
Authorized officers shall establish a minimum bid price for each available allotment as described in § 222.53 of this subpart.
(c)
Prospectus.
(1) At such time as allotments are vacated, as new allotments are established, or as existing competitively bid permits expire, the authorized officer shall prepare and advertise a prospectus for those allotments on which grazing will be permitted.
(2) The prospectus shall include the terms and conditions of occupancy and use under the grazing permit to be issued, as well as document existing improvements and their condition. The prospectus shall also disclose the following:
(i) Estimated market value of the forage per head month of grazing use;
(ii) The minimum bid price the agency will accept;
(iii) Any required range improvements; and
(iv) The minimum qualifications that applicants must meet to be eligible for a permit.
(3) Copies of the applicable grazing permit, allotment management planning documents and allotment maintenance requirements, and the latest annual permittee instructions shall be made available to all prospective bidders upon request.
(d)
Submission of bid.
Each applicant shall submit an application for the grazing permit, along with a sealed bid for the grazing fee, and a bid deposit of 10 percent of the total amount of the bid.
(e)
Qualifications and Deposit Refunds.
Upon opening applicants bids, the authorized officer shall determine whether each bidder meets the qualifications to hold a permit as set forth in Subpart A of this part; and shall refund the deposit to any applicant who is not qualified or who does not offer the high bid.
(f)
Permit Issuance.
The authorized officer shall issue the grazing permit to the qualified high bidder, except as provided in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. The successful bidder receives the privilege of obtaining or renewing a grazing permit and is billed for the occupancy offered and forage sold.
(1)
Priority for Reissuance.
On allotments where a current permit is expiring and competition has been held on a new grazing permit, the current grazing permittee shall have priority for retaining the permit. Accordingly, an applicant who holds the permit on the allotment under bid, who has a satisfactory record of performance under that permit, and who is not the higher bidder for the future grazing privileges in the specified allotment shall be offered the opportunity to match the high bid and thereby retain the permit. Should there be more than one existing permittee in the allotment under bid, each shall be offered the option of meeting the high bid; if only one current permittee opts to meet the high bid, the remaining allowable grazing use, if any, shall be awarded to the initial high bidder.
(2)
Identical Bids.
In cases of identical bids, the selection of the successful applicant shall be made through a drawing.
(g)
Computation of Successful Bidder's Annual Fee
—(1)
Annual Fee Basis.
The highest bid received shall establish the base grazing value in the initial year of the grazing permit for each allotment offered. The annual grazing fee shall equal the base grazing value, adjusted by the current period's hay price index for the relevant subregion as described in § 222.53(c)(1), and (c)(3), less the value of any agency required range improvements. This hay price index shall be based on 3-year average hay prices and annually reflect the percent change in the cost of alternative livestock feed.
(2)
Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements.
Any requirements for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for
range improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource management plan and allotment management plan. These improvements must involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the grazing permit, must be of tangible public benefit, and must enhance management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements specified in allotment management planning documents or the grazing permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.
(h)
No Bids Received.
If qualified sealed bids are not received, the authorized officer reserves the right to conduct an oral auction using the minimum bid price established under paragraph (b) of this section or to establish grazing fees through noncompetitive grazing fee procedures specified in § 222.53 of this subpart.

(b) No person except an authorized Forest Service officer or his agent shall destroy, remove, or relocate any wild free-roaming horse or burro located on the National Forest System.
(c) Wild horses and burros shall be relocated or removed in the following order of priority:
(1) In the most humane manner possible, sick, lame, or old animals shall be destroyed;
(2) Relocate animals to other National Forest System lands which were identified as 1971 wild horse or burro territory, providing suitable habitat exists and relocation of animals will not jeopardize vegetation condition;
(3) Relocate animals to other federally-owned lands which were identified as 1971 wild horse or burro occupied lands, providing suitable habitat exists and relocation of animals will not jeopardize vegetation condition and animals are requested by the appropriate land manager having jurisdiction;
(4) Place animals under private maintenance and care agreements where there is an adoption demand by qualified individuals, groups, or Government agency, and for which there is assurance of humane treatment and care, provided not more than four animals are placed under private maintenance and care agreements per year to any individual, organization, or government agency unless there is a determination expressed otherwise in writing, by an authorized Forest Service Officer; and
(5) Excess animals, for which an adoption demand by qualified applicants does not exist, shall be destroyed in the most humane manner possible, and if several methods are equally humane, select the most cost efficient.
(d) Where excess animals have been placed under private maintenance and care agreements after December 15, 1971, as provided for in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, and animals have been provided humane conditions, treatment, and care, for a period of one year, the Chief, Forest Service, may grant title to not more than four animals per year to each individual, organization, or government agency.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 223.1
Authority to sell timber.
Trees, portions of trees, and other forest products on National Forest System lands may be sold for the purpose of achieving the policies set forth in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, as amended (74 Stat. 215; 16 U.S.C. 528-531), and the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended (88 Stat. 476; as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1600-1614), and the Program thereunder.
§ 223.2
Disposal of timber for administrative use.
Trees, portions of trees, or other forest products in any amount on National Forest System lands may be disposed of for administrative use, by sale or without charge, as may be most advantageous to the United States, subject to the maximum cut fixed in accordance with established policies for management of the National Forests. Such administrative use shall be limited to the following conditions and purposes:
(a) For construction, maintenance or repair of roads, bridges, trails, telephone lines, fences, recreation areas or other improvements of value for the protection or the administration of Federal lands.
(b) For fuel in Federal camps, buildings and recreation areas.
(c) For research and demonstration projects.
(d) For use in disaster relief work conducted by public agencies.
(e) For disposal when removal is desirable to protect or enhance multiple-use values in a particular area.
§ 223.3
Sale of seized material.
Seized material (trees, portions of trees or other forest products cut in trespass from National Forest System lands) may be sold to the highest bidder under specific authorization from the Regional Forester. If advertisement is impractical, sales of material with an appraised value of less than $10,000 will be made on informal bids.
§ 223.4
Exchange of trees or portions of trees.
Trees or portions of trees may be exchanged for land under laws authorizing the exchange of National Forest timber. Cutting of exchange timber must comply with the purposes cited in § 223.1.

Except in unusual cases, the material will be restricted to dead, insect-infested, or diseased timber, logging debris, and thinnings. Other material may be granted in unusual cases where its refusal would cause unwarranted hardship. Where limited supply or other conditions justify such action, the free use of green material may be refused.
§ 223.6
Cutting and removal of timber in free-use areas.
Supervisors may designate portions or all of a National Forest as free-use areas where such action is compatible with land management plans and shall give public notice of their action. Within such free-use areas, any dead timber or any green timber previously marked or designated by forest officers may be cut and removed for personal use for domestic purposes. Cutting and removal of timber in free-use areas shall be in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed by the district ranger to prevent fires, minimize damage to uncut trees and other resources, and to avoid confusion among users.
[42 FR 28252, June 2, 1977, as amended at 44 FR 73029, Dec. 17, 1979. Redesignated at 49 FR 2760, Jan. 23, 1984]
§ 223.7
Permission for free use of timber outside free-use areas.
Similar material may be cut outside of a free-use area without permit in cases of emergency, but the person taking such material shall promptly notify the district ranger.

He will be granted, free of charge, timber from the nearest National Forest land which is ready for harvesting under the applicable management plan, substantially equivalent in kind and quantity to that estimated by the Forest Service to have been cut under Forest Service authorization from the claim subsequent to its location, Forest officers may be delegated authority to grant amounts of timber not in excess of those which these officers are authorized to sell in commercial sales.
(Sec. 4, 69 Stat. 368, 16 U.S.C. 612)
§ 223.10
Free use to Alaskan settlers, miners, residents, and prospectors.
Bona fide settlers, miners, residents, and prospectors for minerals in Alaska may take free of charge green or dried timber from the National Forests in Alaska for personal use but not for sale. Permits will be required for green saw timber. Other material may be taken without permit. The amount of material granted to any one person in 1 year shall not exceed 10,000 board feet of saw timber and 25 cords of wood, or an equivalent volume in other forms. Persons obtaining materials shall, on demand, forward to the supervisor a statement of the quantity taken and the location from which it was removed.
(Sec. 1, 30 Stat. 35, 16 U.S.C. 477)
§ 223.11
Free use to other Federal agencies.
(a) National Forest timber will be granted free of charge to other branches of the Federal Government when authorized by law. Permits may be approved by forest officers for amounts not greater than they are otherwise authorized to sell.

(38 Stat. 1100, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 492)
§ 223.12
Permission to cut, damage, or destroy trees without advertisement.
Permission may be granted to cut, damage, or destroy trees, portions of trees, or other forest products on National Forest System lands without advertisement when necessary for the occupancy of a right-of-way or other authorized use of National Forest System land. Payment for timber of merchantable size and quality will be required at its appraised value, but at not less than applicable minimum prices established by Regional Foresters, and payment will be required for young growth timber below merchantable size at its damage appraisal value. Payment will not be required:
(a) For timber necessarily killed or cut in connection with land uses which are of substantial benefit to the National Forests;
(b) For timber necessarily killed or cut and used by the permittee which would have been granted free under other applicable regulations; or
(c) For timber which will be cut by the permittee which the Forest Service retains for sale in log or other product form.

Sale contracts shall not exceed 10 years in duration, unless there is a finding by the Chief, Forest Service, that better utilization of the various forest resources (consistent with the provisions of the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960) will result.
§ 223.32
Timber sale operating plan.
Sale contracts with a term of 2 years or more shall provide for the filing of an operating plan as soon as practicable after execution of the contract, such plan shall be a part of the contract. The plan of operation shall be general in nature, outlining the expected timing and order of sale development, including such major operations as road construction, felling and
removal of timber, distribution of timber, and contractual requirements for erosion prevention and slash disposal. The plan of operation and revisions thereto shall be subject to concurrence by the Forest Service.
§ 223.33
Redetermination of stumpage rates and deposits.
Sale contracts exceeding 7 years in duration, and those of shorter duration to the extent found desirable by the approving officer, will provide for the redetermination of rates for stumpage and for required deposits at intervals of not more than 5 years, exclusive of any period allowed for the construction of improvements.
§ 223.34
Advance payment.
Sale contracts shall provide that timber and forest products be paid for in advance of cutting, unless the contract authorizes the purchaser to furnish a payment guarantee satisfactory to the Forest Service. Advance payments found to be in excess of amounts due the United States shall be refunded to the current holder of the contract or to successors in interest. (90 Stat. 2959; 16 U.S.C. 472a.)
[43 FR 38008, Aug. 25, 1978. Redesignated at 49 FR 2761, Jan. 23, 1984]
§ 223.35
Performance bond.
Timber sale contracts may require the purchaser to furnish a performance bond for satisfactory compliance with its terms.
§ 223.36
Volume determination.
(a) Timber sale contracts may provide for volume determination by scaling, measuring, weighing, or counting the logs or other products, or by measuring the trees before cutting. If the contract or permit provides for the determination of volume by tree measurement and the timber has been paid for, the marking or otherwise designating of the tree authorizes cutting and removal. Otherwise no timber cut under any contract shall be removed from the place designated until it has been scaled, measured or counted as provided in the timber sale contract, unless such removal is specifically authorized in the contract.
(b) National Forest timber sold on board foot scale shall be scaled by the Scribner Decimal C Log Rule, or if the advertisement and contract or permit so state, by the International
1/4

1/4
-inch Decimal log rule. National Forest timber may also be sold by the cubic volume rule or by cords, each as used by the Forest Service.
§ 223.37
Revegetation of temporary roads.
Timber sale contracts, permits and other documents authorizing the cutting or removal of timber or forest products shall require the purchaser to treat temporary roads constructed or used thereunder so as to permit the reestablishment by artificial or natural means, or vegetative cover on the roadway and areas where the vegetative cover was disturbed by the construction or use of the road, as necessary to minimize erosion from the disturbed area. Such treatment shall be designed to reestablish vegetative cover as soon as practicable, but at least within 10 years after the termination of the contract.
§ 223.38
Standards for road design and construction.
Road construction authorized under timber sale contracts, permits and other documents authorizing the cutting or removal of timber or forest products shall be designed to standards appropriate for the intended uses, considering safety, cost of transportation, and impacts on land and resources. If the sale contract provides for road design standards in excess of those needed for the harvest and removal of timber from that sale, including measures to protect adjacent resource values, provision shall be made in the contract for compensating the purchaser for the additional costs, unless the purchaser elects Government construction under section 14(i) of the National Forest Management Act of 1976.
§ 223.39
[Reserved]
§ 223.40
Cancellation for environmental protection or inconsistency with plans.
Timber sale contracts, permits, and other such instruments, authorizing
the harvesting of trees or other forest products, with terms of longer than 2 years, shall provide for cancellation in order to prevent serious environmental damage or when they are significantly inconsistent with land management plans adopted or revised in accordance with section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended. Such provision shall provide for reasonable compensation to the purchaser for unrecovered costs incurred under the contract and for the difference between the current contract value and the average value of comparable National Forest timber sold during the preceding 6-month period.
§ 223.41
Payment when purchaser elects government road construction.
Each contract having a provision for construction of specified roads with total estimated construction costs of $50,000 or more shall include a provision to ensure that if the purchaser elects government road construction, the purchaser shall pay, in addition to the price paid for the timber or other forest products, an amount equal to the estimated cost of the roads.
[71 FR 11510, Mar. 8, 2006]
§ 223.42
Transfer of effective purchaser credits.
The Forest Service may permit transfer of unused effective purchaser credit earned after December 16, 1975, from one timber sale account to another timber sale account of the same purchaser within the same National Forest, provided the sale contracts provide procedures for the use of purchaser credit. Approval for transfer shall not be granted for amounts needed to satisfy unfulfilled payment obligations or claims for damages due the United States. Purchaser credit transferred under this paragraph is subject to such additional restrictions as may be necessary for its orderly use.
(Pub. L. 94-154, 89 Stat. 823 (16 U.S.C. 535)
[42 FR 63777, Dec. 20, 1977. Redesignated at 49 FR 2761, Jan. 23, 1984]
§ 223.43
Limitation on amounts of transferred purchaser credit.
(a) The amount of purchaser credit which may be transferred into a given sale shall be limited to the difference between remaining current contract value and the total of:
(1) Remaining base rate value needs,
(2) Salvage sale fund needs plus sale area improvement needs in excess of base rate value needs, and
(3) Total purchaser credit limit on the given sale.
(b) This calculation shall be made as of the date of sale award for sales made on or after January 1, 1978. For sales made prior to January 1, 1978, the calculation shall be made as of December 31, 1977, except that if the amount actually transferred in as of December 31, 1977, exceeds the calculated limit, the actual transfers as of that date shall be the established limit. Purchaser credit earned on a sale and subsequently transferred out may be replaced without regard to the transfer in limit. Sale area improvement needs shall be based on the original sale area betterment plan or revisions thereto approved prior to July 1, 1976. Salvage sale fund needs shall be based on the original salvage sale fund plan.

§ 223.44
Collection rights on contracts involved in transfer of purchase credit.
To assure protection of the United States in connection with the implementation of this regulation, contract provisions shall not prevent the Forest Service from carrying out collection rights, authorized by the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 309), between contracts involved in the transfer of purchaser credit. Such claims against the contract receiving the transferred purchaser credit shall be limited to the amount transferred.

§ 223.45
Definitions applicable to transfer of purchaser credit.
As used in §§ 223.42 and 223.43, the term
Purchaser
includes any single individual, corporation, company, firm, partnership, joint venture, or other business entity or the successor in interest of any of the foregoing business entities having timber sale contracts on the same National Forest. The term
National Forest
shall be considered as a unit of the National Forest System, regardless of how it was established, which maintains a separate identity with respect to the distribution of receipts earned thereon to the States and counties. The term
Effective Purchaser Credit
means unused purchaser credit which does not exceed current contract value minus base rate value. The term
base rate value
is the sum of the products of base rates and estimated remaining unscaled (unreported on tree measurement contracts) volumes by species of timber included in a timber sale contract.

§ 223.46
Adjustment of contract termination date.
Timber sale contracts may provide for adjustment of the termination date to provide additional time to compensate for delays in road construction and timber removal due to those causes beyond the purchaser's control, which may include but are not limited to acts of God, acts of the public enemy, acts of the Government, labor disputes, fires, insurrections or floods.
§ 223.47
Date of completion of permanent road construction.
(a) The date of completion of permanent road construction obligations as set forth in the Notice of Sale shall be incorporated into the timber sale contract.
(b) This date is applicable to construction by both the Forest Service and the timber purchaser.
(c) The date is not applicable to roads not needed by the purchaser for timber removal.
(d) The date for completion may be revised, if additional time is needed, under guidelines provided by the Chief, Forest Service, including but not limited to (1) default of contractors or (2) design changes, physical changes, or catastrophic damages which necessitate modification of specified road construction work.
(e) If Forest Service failure to perform results in delay in road completion, the termination date shall be adjusted in accordance with the contract term adjustment provisions of the timber sale contract. If there is substantial delay in performance by the Forest Service, the contract shall provide that rates of payment may be redetermined, at the request of the purchaser, in accordance with guidelines established by the Chief, Forest Service.
(f) If the purchaser retains responsibility for road construction, the date of completion for permanent roads may be modified to conform to the approved plan of operation.
§ 223.48
Restrictions on export and substitution of unprocessed timber.
(a) Contracts for the sale of unprocessed timber from National Forest System lands located west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States and Alaska, awarded before August 20, 1990, shall include provisions implementing the Secretary's timber export and substitution regulations at subpart D of this part in effect prior to that data. Such contracts shall also require purchasers to:
(1) Submit annually, until all unprocessed timber is accounted for, a certified report on the disposition of any unprocessed timber harvested from the sale including a description of unprocessed timber which is sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed of to another person and a description of the relationship with the other person;
(2) Submit annually, until all unprocessed timber from the sale is accounted for, a certified report on the sale of any unprocessed timber from private lands in the tributary area which is exported or sold for export; and
(3) Maintain records of all such transactions involving unprocessed timber and to make such records available for inspection and verification by the Forest Service for up to three (3) years after the sale is terminated.
(b) Contracts for the sale of unprocessed timber from National Forest System lands located west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States, awarded on or after August 20, 1990, shall include provisions implementing the requirements of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620
et seq.).
(c) The reporting and recordkeeping procedures in this section constitute information collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320. These requirements have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned clearance number 0596-0021.
[56 FR 65842, Dec. 19, 1991]
§ 223.49
Downpayments.
(a) For the purposes of this section, the terms listed in this paragraph shall have the following meaning:
(1)
Total bid value
is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the rate the purchaser bid for each species by the estimated volume listed in the contract.
(2)
Bid premium
is the amount in excess of the advertised value that a purchaser bids for timber offered.
(3)
Lump sum timber sales
are premeasured sales where the entire value of the sale is paid in one payment at time of release for cutting.
(4)
Affiliate.
Concerns or individuals are affiliates if directly or indirectly, either one controls or has the power to control the other, or a third party controls or has the power to control both. In determining whether or not affiliation exists, the Forest Service shall consider all appropriate factors, including, but not limited to, common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships.
(b) Timber sale contracts shall include provisions that require purchasers to make a downpayment in cash at the time a timber sale contract is executed, except that a downpayment is not required for stewardship contracts unless the contracting officer determines that a downpayment is needed to ensure the government's financial security.
(c) The minimum downpayment shall be equivalent to 10 percent of the total advertised value of each sale, plus 20 percent of the bid premium, except in those geographic areas where the Chief of the Forest Service determines that it is necessary to increase the amount of the downpayment in order to deter speculation. The amount of the downpayment shall be redetermined when contract rates for timber are redetermined under the terms of the contract for environmental modification; catastrophic damage; market change; or an emergency rate redetermination. For the purpose of recalculating the minimum downpayment, total advertised value shall be replaced with total redetermined value.
(d) A purchaser cannot apply the amount deposited as a downpayment to cover other obligations due on that sale until:
(1) On scaled sales, stumpage value representing 25 percent of the total bid value of the sale has been charged and paid for, or the estimated value of unscaled timber is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment; or
(2) On tree measurement sales, stumpage value representing 25 percent of the total bid value of the sale is shown on the timber sale statement of account to have been cut, removed, and paid for, or the estimated value of timber remaining to be cut, removed and paid for as shown on the timber sale statement of account is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment. On lump sum sales, the downpayment amount may be applied to payment for release of the single payment unit.
(e) A purchaser or any affiliate of that purchaser awarded a Forest Service timber sale contract must meet the additional downpayment requirements of paragraph (g) of this section under the following circumstances:
(1) The purchaser or its affiliate after September 29, 1988, has failed to perform in accordance with the terms of a Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management timber sale contract and is notified by a Contracting Officer that a contract has expired uncompleted or is terminated for cause; and
(2) The estimated value of the unscaled timber on scaled sales, or the estimated value of the timber outstanding on tree measurement sales, included in those terminated or expired contracts exceeds $100,000; and
(3) Unpaid damages claimed by the Government remain outstanding prior to award of the new sale at issue and corrective action has not been taken to avoid future deficient performance.
(f) A subsequent final determination by the Contracting Officer or by a court of competent jurisdiction that a contract was improperly classified under the criteria in paragraph (e) of this section will result in the refund or credit of any unobligated portion of the amount of downpayment exceeding that required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and the limitations of paragraph (h) of this section on application of downpayment shall no longer apply.
(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a purchaser meeting the criteria of paragraph (e) of this section must make a minimum downpayment equal to 20 percent of the total advertised value of that sale, plus 40 percent of the total bid premium. This higher downpayment requirement applies throughout the National Forest System, except in those areas where the Chief of the Forest Service determines, before advertisement of the sale, that another downpayment rate is necessary to achieve the management objectives of the National Forest System. The amount of the downpayment shall be redetermined in accordance with this paragraph when contract rates for timber are redetermined under the terms of the contract for environmental modification; catastrophic damage; market change; or an emergency rate redetermination. For the purpose of redetermining the downpayment, total advertised value shall be replaced with total redetermined value.
(h) A purchaser subject to the additional downpayment requirements of paragraph (g) of this section cannot apply the amount deposited as a downpayment to other uses until:
(1) On scaled sales, the estimated value of the unscaled timber is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment; or
(2) On tree measurement sales, the estimated value remaining to be cut and removed as shown on the timber sale statement of account is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment.
(i) For the purpose of releasing funds deposited as downpayment by a purchaser subject to paragraph (f) of this section, the Forest Service shall compute the estimated value of timber as follows:
(1) On scaled sales, the estimated value of the unscaled timber is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the current contract rate for each species by the difference between the advertised volume and the volume that has been scaled of that species.
(2) On tree measurement sales, the estimated value of the timber outstanding (
i.e.,
not shown on the timber sale statement of account as cut and removed) is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the current contract rate for each species by the difference between the advertised volume and the volume that has been shown on the timber sale statement to have been cut and removed of the species. The current contract rate for each species is that specified in the Forest Service timber sale contract.
(j) In order to deter speculation, the Chief of the Forest Service may increase the period for retention of the downpayment and/or preclude temporary reduction of the downpayment under paragraphs (k)(2) and (k)(3) of this section for future contracts subject to such criteria as the Chief may adopt after giving the public notice and opportunity to comment.
(k) The Forest Service may temporarily reduce the downpayment when a purchaser's scheduled operations are delayed, interrupted, or extended for 30 or more consecutive days for any of the following reasons:
(1) Forest Service requests or orders purchaser to delay or interrupt operations for reasons other than breach;
(2) A contract term addition pursuant to purchaser shifting operations to a sale designated by the Forest Service as in urgent need of harvesting; or
(3) An extension of the contract term authorized upon a determination of substantial overriding public interest, including a market-related contract term addition, or an urgent removal contract term extension under 36 CFR 223.53.
(l) When purchaser is not cutting or removing timber under contract during a qualifying period of delay, interruption, or extension listed in paragraph (k) of this section, the downpayment may be reduced to $1000 or 2 percent of the downpayment amount stated in the contract, whichever is greater. The purchaser must restore the downpayment to the full amount stated in the contract within 15 days from receipt of the bill for collection and written notice from the contracting officer that the basis for temporarily reducing the downpayment no longer exists. Purchaser shall not cut or remove timber on a contract where the downpayment has been temporarily reduced until the downpayment amount stated in the contract is fully restored.
[74 FR 40743, Aug. 13, 2009]
§ 223.50
Periodic payments.
(a) For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the meaning given:
(1)
Total contract value
is the product of the estimated volume of the sale multiplied by the rates bid by the purchaser. Total contract value excludes required deposits and is determined at bid date.
(2)
Current contract value
is the sum of the products of the current contract rates and, in a scaled sale, estimated remaining unscaled volume or, in a tree measurement sale, the estimated remaining quantities by species of included timber meeting utilization standards.
(3)
Normal operating season
is the period so specified in a timber sale contract.
(4)
Periodic payment(s)
is/are amount(s) specified in a timber sale contract that a purchaser must pay by the periodic payment determination date(s) unless reduced by amounts paid as stumpage for volume removed.
(5)
A periodic payment determination date
is a date specified in a timber sale contract upon which the Forest Service will compare the payments made by the timber sale purchaser for timber charges (stumpage), exclusive of required deposits, with the periodic payment amount required as of that date in the contract.
(b) Except for lump sum sales, each timber sale contract of more than one full normal operating season shall provide for periodic payments. The number of periodic payments required will be dependent upon the number of normal operating seasons within the contract, but shall not exceed two such payments during the course of the contract. Periodic payments must be made by the periodic payment determination date, except that the amount of the periodic payment shall be reduced to the extent that timber has been removed and paid for by the periodic payment determination date. Should the payment fall due on a date other than normal billing dates, the contract shall provide that the payment date will be extended to coincide with the next timber sale statement of account billing date.
(1) At a minimum, each such contract shall require an initial periodic payment at the midpoint between the specified road completion date and the termination date. If there is no road construction requirement, payment shall be due at the midpoint between award date and the termination date.
(2) Contracts exceeding 2 full operating seasons shall require an additional periodic payment to be due no later than the midpoint of the last normal operating season or 12 months from the initial periodic payment whichever date is first.
(3) Notwithstanding this paragraph (b), periodic payments are not required for stewardship contracts unless the contracting officer determines that periodic payments are needed to ensure the Government's financial security.
(c) Each timber sale contract shall require the initial periodic payment to equal 35 percent of the total contract value or 50 percent of the bid premium, whichever is greater. The amount of this periodic payment will be reduced if the payment would result in the purchaser's credit balance for timber charges exceeding the current contract value.
(d) Where an additional periodic payment is required by the timber sale contract, this payment will equal 75 percent of the total contract value. The amount of this periodic payment will be reduced if the payment would
result in the purchaser's credit balance for timber charges exceeding the current contract value.
(e) Dates for determining future periodic payments shall be adjusted as follows:
(1) When contract term adjustments are granted under § 223.46,
(2) When market-related contract term additions are granted under § 223.52,
(3) When urgent removal extensions are granted under § 223.53, or
(4) When extensions in the substantial overriding public interest are granted under § 223.115(b). Periodic payment determination dates shall not be adjusted when a contract term extension is granted under the general authority of § 223.115(a).
(f) The amount of any periodic payment(s) not yet reached shall be revised when rates are redetermined under the contract. The revised periodic payment amounts shall be based on a recalculated total contract value using the same procedures described in (c) and (d) of this section. The recalculated total contract value is the current contract value following the rate redetermination plus:
(1) The total value of timber scaled prior to establishing redetermined rates in a scaled sale; or
(2) The total value of timber shown on the timber sale statement of account as having been cut, removed and paid for.

§ 223.51
Bid monitoring.
Each Regional Forester shall monitor bidding patterns on timber sales to determine if speculative bidding is occurring or if Purchasers are bidding in such a way that they would be unable to perform their obligations under the timber sale contract. A Regional Forester shall propose to the Chief changes in service wide timber sale procedures, as they appear necessary, to discourage speculative bidding.
[50 FR 41500, Oct. 11, 1985]
§ 223.52
Market-related contract term additions.
(a)
Contract provision.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, each timber sale contract exceeding 1 year in length shall contain a provision for the addition of time to the contract term, under the following conditions:
(i) The Chief of the Forest Service has determined that adverse wood products market conditions have resulted in a drastic reduction in wood product prices applicable to the sale; and
(ii) The purchaser makes a written request for additional time to perform the contract.
(2) The contract term addition provision of the contract must specify the index to be applied to each sale. The Forest Supervisor shall determine and select from paragraph (b) of this section, the index to be used for each sale based on the species and product characteristics, by volume, being harvested on the sale. The index specified shall represent more than one-half of the advertised volume. If none of the indices in paragraph (b) of this section represent more than one-half of the advertised volume, the index specified shall represent the species product combination representing the highest percentage of volume for which there is an index. When the Forest Supervisor determines that the species and potential product characteristics are such that more than one index could be used, the prospectus will state that the Contracting Officer may, upon the purchaser's written request, select an alternative index from paragraph (b) of this section, and may modify the contract by mutual agreement, at time of contract execution, to include an alternative index that the Contracting Officer has determined represents the highest percentage of products the purchaser intends to produce or have produced from the sale. Purchasers seeking a change of index at time of award must substantiate the need for an alternative index by providing the Contracting Officer with a written request that includes a list of products by volume the purchaser intends to produce or expects will be produced from the
timber on that sale. In the event a mutual agreement to modify a contract to include an alternative index is not reached at time of contract execution, the index specified in the sample contract shall apply.
(3) A market-related contract term addition provision shall not be included in contracts where the primary management objective requires prompt removal of the timber, such as, timber is subject to rapid deterioration, timber is in a wildland-urban interface area, or hazard trees adjacent to developed sites.
(b)
Determination of drastic wood product price reductions.
(1) The Forest Service shall monitor and use Producer Price Indices, as prepared by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), adjusted to a constant dollar base, to determine if market-related contract term additions are warranted.
(i) The Forest Service shall monitor and use only the following indices:
BLS producer price index
Index
series
Index code
Hardwood Lumber
Commodity
0812
Softwood Lumber
Commodity
0811
Wood Chips
Industry
3211135
(ii) Preliminary index values will be revised when final index values become available, however, determination of a qualifying quarter will not be revised when final index values become available.
(2) For PPI index codes 0811 and 0812, the Chief of the Forest Service shall determine that a drastic reduction in wood prices has occurred when, for any 2 or more consecutive qualifying quarters, the applicable adjusted price index is less than 88.5 percent of the average of such index for the 4 highest of the 8 calendar quarters immediately prior to the qualifying quarter. A qualifying quarter is a quarter, following the contract award date, where the applicable adjusted index is more than 11.5 percent below the average of such index for the 4 highest of the previous 8 calendar quarters. For PPI index code 3211135, the Chief of the Forest Service shall determine that a drastic reduction in wood prices has occurred when, for any 2 or more consecutive qualifying quarters, the adjusted price index is less than 85 percent of the average of such index for the 4 highest of the 8 calendar quarters immediately prior to the qualifying quarter. A qualifying quarter is a quarter, following the contract award date, where the adjusted index is more than 15 percent below the average of such index for the 4 highest of the previous eight calendar quarters. Qualifying quarter determinations will be made using the Producer Price Indices for the months of March, June, September, and December.
(3) A determination, made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that a drastic reduction in wood product prices has occurred, shall constitute a finding that the substantial overriding public interest justifies the contract term addition.
(c)
Granting market-related contract term additions.
When the Chief of the Forest Service determines, pursuant to this section, that a drastic reduction in wood product prices has occurred, the Forest Service is to notify affected timber sale purchasers. For any contract which has been awarded and has not been terminated, the Forest Service, upon a purchaser's written request, will add 1 year to the contract's terms, except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. This 1-year addition includes time outside of the normal operating season.
(1) Additional contract time may not be granted for those portions of the contract:
(i) With a required completion date;
(ii) Where the Forest Service determines that the timber is in need of urgent removal;
(iii) Where timber deterioration or resource damage may result from delay; or
(iv) Where included timber is designated by diameter and delay may change the treatment as a result of trees growing into or out of the specified diameter range(s).
(2) For each additional consecutive quarter in which a contract qualifies for market-related contract term addition, the Forest Service will, upon the purchaser's written request, add an additional 3 months during the normal operating season to the contract, except that no single 3-month addition
shall extend the term of a contract by more than 1 year.
(3) No more than 3 years shall be added to a contract's term by market-related contract term addition unless the following conditions are met:
(i) The sale was awarded after December 31, 2006;
(ii) A drastic reduction in wood product prices occurred in at least ten of twelve consecutive quarters during the contract term, but not including the quarter in which the contract was awarded; and
(4) For each qualifying quarter meeting the criteria in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the Forest Service will, upon the purchaser's written request, add an additional 3 months during the normal operating season to the contract, except no single 3-month addition shall extend the term of a contract by more than 1 year.
(5) In no event shall a revised contract term exceed 10 years as a result of market-related contract term addition.
(d)
Recalculation of periodic payments.
Where a contract is lengthened as a result of market conditions, any subsequent periodic payment dates shall be delayed 1 month for each month added to the contract's term.

§ 223.53
Urgent removal contract extensions.
(a)
Finding.
There is substantial, overriding public interest in extending National Forest System timber sale contracts for undamaged (green) timber not requiring expeditious removal in order to facilitate the rapid harvest of catastrophically damaged timber requiring expeditious removal on private or other non-National Forest System lands. Such an extension may be granted when a specific catastrophic event beyond the control of the landowner occurs on non-National Forest System lands that poses a threat to general forest health, public safety, and property. Catastrophic events include, but are not limited to, severe wildfire, wind, floods, insects and disease infestation, and drought.
(b)
Regional Forester determination.
If the Regional Forester determines that adequate cause for urgent removal extensions exists, Contracting Officers may extend National Forest System timber sale contracts, up to a maximum of 1 year, for the estimated amount of time required to harvest and process the damaged timber on non-National Forest System lands. Contracting Officers may grant urgent removal extensions only when the Regional Forester verifies in writing that:
(1) A specific catastrophe occurred for which urgent removal extensions should be granted;
(2) The manufacturing facilities or logging equipment capacity available to purchasers are insufficient to provide for both the rapid harvest of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal and the continued harvest of undamaged (green) timber under contract with the Forest Service; and
(3) Failure to harvest the damaged non-National Forest System timber promptly could result in the following:
(i) Pose a threat to public safety,
(ii) Create a threat of an insect or disease epidemic to National Forest System or other lands or resources, or
(iii) Significant private or other public resource loss.
(c)
Purchaser request.
To obtain an urgent removal extension on a National Forest System timber sale contract, a purchaser must make a written request to the Contracting Officer, which includes the following:
(1) An explanation of why the harvest of undamaged (green) National Forest System timber within the term of the existing National Forest System contract(s) will prevent or otherwise impede the removal of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal; and
(2) Documentation that the manufacturing facilities or logging equipment capacity available to a purchaser would be insufficient to provide for both the rapid salvage of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal and continued harvest of undamaged (green) National Forest System timber under contract with the Forest Service.
(d)
Contracting Officer determination.
To grant an urgent removal extension, the timber sale Contracting Officer must verify the following:
(1) That it is likely that the undamaged (green) timber from National Forest System land would be delivered to the same manufacturing facilities as are needed to process the damaged non-National Forest System timber or the National Forest System timber sale contract would require the use of the same logging equipment as is needed to remove the damaged non-National Forest System timber from the area affected by the catastrophe;
(2) That extension of the National Forest System contract will not be injurious to the United States and will protect, to the extent possible, the health of the National Forest System lands, including:
(i) That urgent removal extension does not adversely affect other resource management objectives to be implemented by the National Forest System timber sale being extended; and
(ii) That the National Forest System timber sale contract to be extended is not a sale containing damaged, dead, or dying timber subject to rapid deterioration.
(3) That the purchaser has not been granted a previous urgent removal extension on the same National Forest System timber sale contract based on the current catastrophic event. Subsequent urgent removal extensions may be granted if there are subsequent Regional Forester determinations on other catastrophic events.
(4) That the revised National Forest System timber sale contract term will not exceed 10 years from the date the National Forest System contract was awarded; and
(5) That the purchaser is not in breach of the National Forest System contract, and all work items, payments, and deposits are current.
(e)
Execution of contract extension.
An urgent removal extension of a National Forest System timber sale contract is executed through a mutual agreement contract modification pursuant to § 223.112, which must include specific contract provisions. An agreement to modify a contract must identify the specific provision(s) of the contract being modified and must include the requirement that purchasers make cash payment to cover the costs of remarking timber on the sale area or reestablishing cutting unit boundaries if the Contracting Officer determines such work is necessary.
(f)
Information collection.
The information required of a purchaser to request an extension of an National Forest System timber sale contract, as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section, to facilitate expeditious removal of timber from non-National Forest System lands constitutes an information collection requirement as defined in 5 CFR Part 1320 and has been assigned Office of Management and Budget control number 0596-0167.

# Appraisal and Pricing
§ 223.60
Determining fair market value.
The objective of Forest Service timber appraisals is to determine fair market value. Fair market value is estimated by such methods as are authorized by the Chief, Forest Service, through issuance of agency directives (36 CFR 200.4). Valid methods to determine fair market value include, but are not limited to, transaction evidence appraisals, analytical appraisals, comparison appraisals, and independent estimates based on average investments. Pertinent factors affecting market value also considered include, but are not limited to, prices paid and valuations established for comparable timber, selling value of products produced, estimated operating costs, operating difficulties, and quality of timber. Considerations and valuations may recognize and adjust for factors which are not normal market influences.
[61 FR 5685, Feb. 14, 1996]
§ 223.61
Establishing minimum stumpage rates.
The Chief, Forest Service, shall establish minimum stumpage rates, i.e., “base rates,” for species and products on individual National Forests, or groups of National Forests. Timber shall be sold for appraised value or
minimum stumpage rates, whichever is higher. No timber may be sold or cut under timber sale contracts for less than minimum stumpage rates except to provide for the removal of insect-infested, diseased, dead or distressed timber or in accordance with contract provisions specifically providing for catastrophically-affected timber and incidental amounts of material not meeting utilization standards of the timber sale contract. For any timber sale offering where deposits are to be required for reforestation under the Act of June 9, 1930, as amended (46 Stat. 527; 16 U.S.C. 576-576b) which exceed the value of the established minimum stumpage rates, the minimum rates may be increased by the approving officer as necessary to the amount of such required reforestation deposits and a minimum deposit to the Treasury. Minimum rates in timber sale contracts will not be set higher than established minimum rates for purposes other than assuring adequate funds for reforestation.
§ 223.62
Timber purchaser road construction credit.
Appraisal may also establish stumpage value as if unconstructed roads or other developments needed by the purchaser for removal of the timber were in place. When timber is appraised and sold on such basis,
purchaser credit
for road construction, not to exceed the estimated construction cost of such roads or other developments specified in the timber sale contract, shall, when such construction is accomplished by purchaser, be deducted from stumpage payments made by or due from purchaser under the timber sale contract for other than minimum stumpage rates and required deposits for slash disposal and road maintenance. As used in this section
estimated construction costs
means the total cost of constructing all permanent roads specified in the timber sale contract, estimated as if construction is to be accomplished by an independent contractor who is not the timber purchaser. In determining the purchaser credit amount applicable against timber payments, the estimated construction cost may be reduced for the effect of differences in applicable wage rates.
§ 223.63
Advertised rates.
Timber shall be advertised for sale at its appraised value. The road construction cost used to develop appraised value means the total estimated cost of constructing all permanent roads specified in the timber sale contract, estimated as if construction is to be accomplished by the timber purchaser. The advertised rates shall be not less than minimum stumpage rates, except that sales of insect-infested, diseased, dead, or distressed timber may be sold at less than minimum rates when harvest of such timber is necessary to protect or improve the forest or prevent waste of usable wood fiber.
[71 FR 11510, Mar. 8, 2006]
§ 223.64
Appraisal on a lump-sum value or rate per unit of measure basis.

§ 223.85
Noncompetitive sale of timber.
(a) Forest officers may sell, within their authorization, without further advertisement, at not less than appraised value, any timber previously advertised for competitive bids but not sold because of lack of bids and any timber on uncut areas included in a contract which has been terminated by abandonment, cancellation, contract period expiration, or otherwise if such timber would have been cut under the contract. This authority shall not be
utilized if there is evidence of competitive interest in the product.
(b) Extraordinary conditions, as provided for in 16 U.S.C. 472a(d), are defined to include the potential harm to natural resources, including fish and wildlife, and related circumstances arising as a result of the award or release of timber sale contracts pursuant to section 2001(k) of Public Law 104-19 (109 Stat. 246). Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section or any other regulation in this part, for timber sale contracts that have been or will be awarded or released pursuant to section 2001(k) of Public Law 104-19 (109 Stat. 246), the Secretary of Agriculture may allow forest officers to, without advertisement, modify those timber sale contracts by substituting timber from outside the sale area specified in the contract for timber within the timber sale contract area.
(c) Extraordinary conditions, as provided for in 16 U.S.C. 472a(d), includes those conditions under which contracts for the sale or exchange of timber or other forest products must be suspended, modified, or terminated under the terms of such contracts to prevent environmental degradation or resource damage, or as the result of administrative appeals, litigation, or court orders. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section or any other regulation in this part, when such extraordinary conditions exist on sales not addressed in paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary of Agriculture may allow forest officers to, without advertisement, modify those contracts by substituting timber or other forest products from outside the contract area specified in the contract for timber or forest products within the area specified in the contract. When such extraordinary conditions exist, the Forest Service and the purchaser shall make good faith efforts to identify replacement timber or forest products of similar volume, quality, value, access, and topography. When replacement timber or forest products agreeable to both parties is identified, the contract will be modified to reflect the changes associated with the substitution, including a rate redetermination. Concurrently, both parties will sign an agreement waiving any future claims for damages associated with the deleted timber or forest products, except those specifically provided for under the contract up to the time of the modification. If the Forest Service and the purchaser cannot reach agreement on satisfactory replacement timber or forest products, or the proper value of such material, either party may opt to end the search. Replacement timber or forest products must come from the same National Forest as the original contract. The term National Forest in this paragraph refers to an administrative unit headed by a single Forest Supervisor. Only timber or forest products for which a decision authorizing its harvest has been made and for which any applicable appeals or objection process has been completed may be considered for replacement pursuant to this paragraph. The value of replacement timber or forest products may not exceed the value of the material it is replacing by more than $10,000, as determined by standard Forest Service appraisal methods.

§ 223.86
Bid restriction on resale of noncompleted contract.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no bid will be considered in the resale of timber remaining from any uncompleted timber sale contract from any person, or from an affiliate of such person, who failed to complete the original contract:
(1) Because of termination for purchaser's branch or; or
(2) Through failure to cut designated timber on portions of the sale area by the termination date, unless acceptance of such bid is determined to be in the public interest.
(b) The no bid restriction in the preceding paragraph:
(1) Shall only apply when 50 percent or more of the timber included in the resale is timber remaining from the uncompleted contract and the resale is advertised within 3 years of the date the uncompleted contract terminated;
(2) When imposed because of failure to cut designated timber on portions of the sale area by the termination date,
shall not apply to resales of timber for which the original contract was awarded prior to April 30, 1972, unless the contract is extended thereafter; and
(3) Shall not apply to:
(i) Resales of timber within a sustained yield unit unless competition may be invited under the policy statement for the unit,
(ii) Resales of timber on contract which would ordinarily have been awarded prior to April 30, 1972, if award was delayed through no fault of the purchaser, and
(iii) Resales of timber on contracts not extended because of environmental considerations.
(c) Where a third-party agreement has been approved in accordance with § 223.114; the original purchaser shall not be affected by this section unless such purchaser is an affiliate of the third party.
(d) As used in this section,
person
includes any individual, corporation, company, association, firm, partnership, society, joint stock company, or other business entity or the successor in interest of any of the foregoing business entities. A person is an
affiliate
when either directly or indirectly:
(1) A person controls or has the power to control the other, or
(2) A third person or persons control or has the power to control both.

(c) The Chief, Forest Service, shall specify the use of sealed bids or a mix of bidding methods in areas where he has reasonable belief that collusive bidding may be occurring or where he determines that less than normal competitive bidding is occurring.
(d) Sealed bids shall be used for sales within Federal Sustained Yield Units, except where the policy statement for the Unit restricts purchasers of timber within the Unit from buying National Forest timber outside the Unit and the Chief determines that oral bidding will protect individual communities within the Unit.
(e) The Chief, Forest Service, may authorize departures from the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section when he determines that departures are necessary to protect the public interest.
(f) The Chief, Forest Service, may authorize the testing and evaluation of alternative bidding methods for National Forest timber.

Relation to other bidders.
Any bidder or applicant for a sale may be required to furnish a statement
of his relation to other bidders or operators, including, if desired by the supervisor or Regional Forester, a certified statement of stockholders or members of the firm, and the holders of bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, so far as known, so that the statement will show the extent of the interest of each in the bidder or applicant.

# Award of Contracts
§ 223.100

(a) Determination is made to reject all bids.
(b) Two or more bidders, all of whom meet the requirements, submit equal bids which are the highest bids, in which case award may be by the drawing of lots. Equal bids from parties having direct or indirect common control or association in logging, processing or marketing may be consolidated to the extent deemed necessary by the awarding officer in order to give to any others who have bid the same amount an equitable opportunity in the drawing of lots.
(c) The highest bidder is notoriously or habitually careless with fire.
(d) Monopoly, injurious to the public welfare, would result from the control of large amounts of public or of public and private timber.
(e) The high bidder has elected Forest Service road construction in response to an advertisement extending such an option, the Forest Service cannot perform the construction and in response to solicitation has not received a satisfactory bid for such construction within the period stated in the prospectus and the high timber sale bidder is unwilling to perform the construction.

§ 223.101
Determination of purchaser responsibility.
(a) A Contracting Officer shall not award a timber sale contract unless that officer makes an affirmative determination of purchaser responsibility. In the absence of information clearly indicating that the prospective purchaser is responsible, the Contracting Officer shall conclude that the prospective purchaser does not qualify as a responsible purchaser.
(b) To determine a purchaser to be responsible, a Contracting Officer must find that:
(1) The purchaser has adequate financial resources to perform the contract or the ability to obtain them;
(2) The purchaser is able to perform the contract within the contract term taking into consideration all existing commercial and governmental business commitments;
(3) The purchaser has a satisfactory performance record on timber sale contracts. A prospective purchaser that is or recently has been seriously deficient in contract performance shall be presumed not to be responsible, unless the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances were beyond the purchaser's control and were not created through improper actions by the purchaser or affiliate, or that the purchaser has taken appropriate corrective action. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably under a contract is strong evidence that a purchaser is not a responsible contractor. The Contracting Officer shall consider the number of contracts involved and extent of deficiency of each in making this evaluation;
(4) The purchaser has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;
(5) The purchaser has or is able to obtain equipment and supplies suitable for logging the timber and for meeting the resource protection provisions of the contract;
(6) The purchaser is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations.
(c) If the prospective purchaser is a small business concern and the Contracting Officer determines that the
purchaser does not qualify as a responsible purchaser on an otherwise acceptable bid, the Contracting Officer shall refer the matter to the Small Business Administration which will decide whether or not to issue a Certificate of Competency.
(d) Affiliated concerns, as defined in § 223.49(a)(5) of this subpart are normally considered separate entities in determining whether the concern that is to perform the contract meets the applicable standards for responsibility. However, the Contracting Officer shall consider an affiliate's past performance and integrity when they may adversely affect the prospective purchaser's responsibility.
[53 FR 33132, Aug. 30, 1988]
§ 223.102
Procedures when sale is not awarded to highest bidder.
If the highest bid is not accepted and the sale is still deemed desirable, all bids may be rejected and the timber readvertised; or, if the highest bidder cannot meet the requirements under which the timber was advertised or the withholding of award to him is based on one or more of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of § 223.100, award at the highest price bid may be offered to the next highest qualified bidder or to the other qualified bidders in order of their bids until the award is accepted by one or refused by all of the qualified bidders.

§ 223.103
Award of small business set-aside sales.
If timber is advertised as set aside for competitive bidding by small business concerns, award will be made to the highest bidder who qualifies as a small business concern and who has not been determined by the Small Business Administration to be ineligible for preferential award of set-aside sales. If there are no qualified small business bidders any readvertisement shall be without restriction on the size of bidders.

Administration of contracts in designated disaster areas.
This section is to implement the provisions of section 242 (a), (b), and (c) of the Disaster Relief Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1956) which relate to contracts for the sale of National Forest timber in connection with areas damaged by major disaster as designated by the President pursuant to the Act.
(a) Where an existing contract for the sale of National Forest timber does not provide relief from major physical change not due to purchaser's negligence prior to approval of construction of any section of specified road or other specified development facility and, as a result of a major disaster in a designated area a major physical change results in additional construction work by the purchaser in connection with such a road or facility, the United States shall bear such increased construction cost if, as determined by the Chief, Forest Service, the estimated cost is—
(1) More than $1,000 for sales under 1 million board feet, or
(2) More than $1 per thousand board feet for sales of 1 to 3 million board feet, or
(3) More than $3,000 for sales over 3 million board feet.
(b) Where the Chief, Forest Service, determines that damages are so great that restoration, reconstruction, or construction is not practical under the cost-sharing arrangement in paragraph
(a) of this section, he may allow cancellation of the contract notwithstanding provisions therein or in § 223.116.
(c) The Chief, Forest Service, is authorized to reduce to 7 days the minimum time to advertise the sale of National Forest timber whenever he determines that—
(1) The sale of such timber will assist in the construction of any area of a State damaged by a major disaster,
(2) The sale of such timber will assist in sustaining the economy of such area, or
(3) The sale of such timber is necessary to salvage the value of timber damaged in such major disaster or to protect undamaged timber.
(d) Any request for relief under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be made in writing to the Forest Supervisor having administrative responsibility for the land involved.
(Sec. 242 (a), (b), and (c), 84 Stat. 1756, 42 U.S.C. 4461)
§ 223.112
Modification of contracts.
(a) Timber sale contracts may be modified only when the modification will apply to unexecuted portions of the contract and will not be injurious to the United States. Modifications may be made by the officer approving the sale, by his successor, or by his superior, except as provided in § 223.110.
(b) Timber sale contracts awarded after October 1, 1995, that have been suspended for more than 90 days, during the normal operating season, at no fault of the purchaser, because of administrative appeals or litigation, that did not include contract provisions for rate redeterminations may be modified at the request of the timber sale purchaser to include a rate redetermination for the remaining unharvested volume to reflect significant decreases in market value during the period of delay. Rates in effect at the time of the suspension will be redetermined in accordance with the standard Forest Service methods in effect 45 days prior to the rate redetermination.

When determining compensation under a contract, timber payment rates shall be redetermined in accordance with appraisal methods in § 223.60 of this subpart.
[61 FR 64816, Dec. 9, 1996]
§ 223.114
Acquisition by third party.
No agreement permitting a third party to acquire the rights of a purchaser under a timber sale contract may be recognized and approved by the Forest Service except in writing, signed by the officer approving the sale, his successor, or superior officer. Such approval shall not relieve the purchaser of his responsibilities or liabilities under the timber sale contract and may be given only if—
(a) The third party is acceptable to the Forest Service as a purchaser of timber under the conditions and requirements then in effect for similar timber sales and assumes in writing all of the obligations to the Forest Service under the terms of the timber sale contract as to the uncompleted portion thereof, or
(b) The rights are acquired in trust as security and subject to such conditions as may be necessary for the protection of the public interests.
§ 223.115
Contract extensions.
The term of any contract or permit shall not be extended unless the approving officer finds:
(a) That the purchaser has diligently performed in accordance with contract provisions and an approved plan of operation; or
(b) That the substantial overriding public interest justifies the extension.
§ 223.116
Cancellation.
(a) Timber sale contracts and permits may be canceled:
(1) For serious or continued violation of their terms.
(2) Upon application, or with the consent of the purchaser, when such action is of advantage to the United States or not prejudicial to its interests.
(3) Upon application of the purchaser if the value of the timber remaining to be cut is diminished materially because of catastrophic damage caused by forces beyond the control of the purchaser resulting in (i) physical change in the sale area or access to it, or (ii) damage to timber remaining to be cut.
(4) For conviction of violation of criminal statutes or, following final agency or judicial determination, of violation of civil standards, orders, permits, or others regulations for the protection of environmental quality issued by a Federal agency, State agency, or political subdivision thereof, in the conduct of operations thereunder, on National Forest System land, unless compliance with such laws or regulations would preclude performance of other contractual requirements.
(5) Upon determination by the Chief, Forest Service, that operations thereunder would result in serious environmental degradation or resource damage and with reasonable compensation to the purchaser for unrecovered costs incurred under the contract and the difference between the current contract value and the average value of comparable National Forest timber sold during the preceding 6-month period.
(b) Cancellation will be by the Chief, Forest Service. Authority to cancel contracts under paragraph (a)(1) through (4) of this section may be delegated to Regional Foresters for sales within their authorization. All contract cancellations under paragraph (a)(5) of this section shall be by the Chief, Forest Service, whose decision shall be the final agency decision.

Administration of cooperative or Federal sustained yield units.
With respect to sustained yield units established pursuant to the provisions of the Act of March 29, 1944 (58 Stat. 132; 16 U.S.C. 583-583l), the Chief, Forest Service, with authority to delegate to other officers and employees of the Forest Service:
(a) Shall provide that National Forest timber in any sustained yield unit shall be available in sufficient amounts to meet the needs of bona fide farmers, settlers, miners, residents and prospectors for minerals for personal and domestic use as provided by law and by regulation.
(b) May offer for sale to cooperators, without competition but at not less than appraised value, timber on National Forest lands within an approved cooperative sustained yield unit; or, if the approved sustained yield unit consists entirely of federally owned or administered forest land and if necessary for the maintenance of a stable community or communities, may offer National Forest timber for sale to responsible operators within such community or communities, at not less than appraised value but without competition or with competition restricted to responsible operators who will manufacture the timber to at least a stated degree within the community or communities to be maintained. Each such sale which involves more than $500 in stumpage value may be made only after notice has been given in advance by such means as may be deemed effective in informing the public of the proposed action, including in any event, publication, once weekly for four consecutive weeks and with additional insertions if needed, in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the vicinity of the place where the timber is located, of a notice of the proposed sale stating at least:
(1) The location, estimated quantity and appraised value of the timber to be cut;
(2) The name and address of the proposed purchaser or those of the operators among whom bidding is to be restricted;
(3) The time and place of a public advisory hearing on the proposed sale, to
be held not earlier than 30 days after the first publication of said notice, if requested by the State or county where the timber is located or by any other person deemed to have a reasonable interest in the proposed sale or in its terms; and
(4) The title and address of the officer of the Forest Service to whom any request for such hearing should be made.
Such requests need be considered only if received at the place designated in the notice not later than 15 days after the first publication of such notice.

§ 223.118
Appeal process for small business timber sale set-aside program share recomputation decisions.
(a)
Decisions subject to appeal.
The rules of this section govern appeal of recomputation decisions related to structural, special, or market changes or the scheduled 5-year recomputations of the small business share of National Forest System timber sales. Certain decisions related to recomputation of shares, such as structural change and carryover volume, may require two decisions, one to determine that a recomputation is needed and the other to recompute the shares. Decisions made both at the earlier stage as well as the later stage are appealable.
(b)
Manner of giving notice
—(1)
Predecisional notice and comment.
The Responsible Official shall provide qualifying timber sale purchasers, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 30 days for predecisional review and comment on any draft decision to
reallocate shares, including the data used in making the proposed recomputation decision.
(2)
Notice of decision.
Upon close of the 30-day predecisional review period, the Responsible Official shall consider any comments received. Within 15 days of the end of the comment period, the Responsible Official shall make a decision on the small business shares and shall give prompt written notice to all parties on the national forest timber sale bidders list for the affected area. The notice of decision must identify the name of the Appeal Deciding Officer, the address, the date by which an appeal must be filed, and a source for obtaining the appeal procedures information.
(c)
Who may appeal or file written comments as an interested party.
(1) Only timber sale purchasers, or their representatives, who are affected by recomputations of the small business share of timber sales as described in paragraph (a) of this section and who have submitted predecisional comments pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may appeal recomputation decisions under this section or may file written comments as an interested party.
(2) Interested parties are defined as the Small Business Administration and those timber sale purchasers, or their representatives, who are affected by recomputations of the small business share of timber sales as described in paragraph (a) of this section and who have individually, or through an association to which they belong, submitted predecisional comments pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(i) A timber sale purchaser may submit comments on an appeal as an interested party if an association to which the purchaser belongs filed predecisional comment but later decides not to appeal or not to file comments as an interested party.
(ii) A timber sale purchaser, who is a member of an association that appeals a decision, may not file a separate appeal unless that purchaser filed separate predecisional comment under paragraph (b)(1).
(3) Interested parties who submit written comments on an appeal filed by another party may not continue an appeal if the appellant withdraws the appeal.
(d)
Level of appeal.
Only one level of review is available for appeal of decisions pertaining to recomputations under the Small Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program. The Appeal Deciding Officer is the official one level above the level of the Responsible Official who made the recomputation of shares decision. The Responsible Official is normally the Forest Supervisor; thus, the Appeal Deciding Officer is normally the Regional Forester. However, when the Regional Forester makes recomputation decisions, the Appeal Deciding Officer is the Chief or such officer at the National headquarters level as the Chief may designate.
(e)
Filing procedures.
In order to file an appeal under this section, an appellant must file a notice of appeal, as specified in the notice of decision, with the Appeal Deciding Officer within 20 days of the date on the notice of the decision. This date must be specified in the notice of decision given pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Written comments filed by an interested party in response to an appeal must be filed within 15 days after the close of the appeal filing period.
(f)
Content of notice of appeal.
(1) It is the responsibility of the appellant to provide sufficient narrative evidence and argument to show why a recomputation decision by the Responsible Official should be reversed or changed.
(2) An appellant must include the following information in a notice of appeal:
(i) The appellant's name, mailing address, and daytime telephone number;
(ii) The title or type of recomputation decision involved, the date of the decision, and the name of the Responsible Official;
(iii) A brief description and date of the decision being appealed:
(iv) A statement of how the appellant is adversely affected by the decision being appealed;
(v) A statement of the facts in dispute regarding the issue(s) raised by the appeal;
(vi) If relevant, any specific references to any law, regulation, or policy that the appellant believes to have
been violated and the basis for such an allegation;
(vii) A statement as to whether and how the appellant has tried to resolve with the Responsible Official the issue(s) being appealed, including evidence of submission of written comments at the predecisional stage as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, the date of any discussion, and the outcome of that meeting or contact; and
(viii) A statement of the relief the appellant seeks.
(g)
Time periods and timeliness.
(1) All time periods applicable to this section will begin on the first day following a decision or action related to the appeal.
(2) Time periods applicable to this section are computed using calendar days. Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal holidays are included in computing the time allowed for filing an appeal; however, when the filing period would expire on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the filing time is automatically extended to the end of the next Federal working day.
(3) It is the responsibility of those filing an appeal to file the notice of appeal by the end of the filing period. In the event of questions, legible postmarks on a mailed appeal or the time and date imprint on a facsimile appeal will be considered evidence of timely filing. Where postmarks or facsimile imprints are illegible, the Appeal Deciding Officer shall rule on the timeliness of the notice of appeal.
(4) The time period for filing a notice of appeal is not extendable.
(h)
Dismissal without decision.
The Appeal Deciding Officer shall dismiss an appeal and close the record without a decision in any of the following circumstances:

(3) The appellant's notice of appeal does not contain responses required by paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (f)(2)(viii) of this section; or
(4) The appellant did not submit written comments on the proposed decision of the new recomputed shares as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(i)
Appeal record.
The appeal record consists of the written decision being appealed, any predecisional comments received, any written comments submitted by interested parties, any other supporting data used to make the decision, the notice of appeal, and, if prepared, a responsive statement by the Responsible Official which addresses the issues raised in the notice of appeal. The Responsible Official must forward the record to the Appeal Deciding Officer within 7 days of the date the notice of appeal is received. A copy of the appeal record must be sent to the appellant at the same time.
(j)
Appeal decision
—(1)
Responsive statement for appeal decision.
The Appeal Deciding Officer may request the Responsible Official to prepare a responsive statement. However, if the information in the files clearly demonstrates the rationale for the Responsible Official's decision, then a responsive statement addressing the points of the appeal is not necessary.
(2)
Appeal issue clarification.
For clarification of issues raised in the appeal, the Appeal Deciding Officer may request additional information from either the Responsible Official, the appellant, or an interested party who has submitted comments on the appeal. At the discretion of the Appeal Deciding Officer, an appellant or interested party may be invited to discuss data relevant to the appeal. Information provided to clarify issues or facts in the appeal must be based upon information previously documented in the file or appeal. Any information provided as a result of the Appeal Deciding Officer's request for more information must be made available to all parties, that is, to the Responsible Official, the appellant, and interested parties who have submitted comments on the appeal. All parties will have 5 days after the Appeal Deciding Officer receives the additional information to review and comment on the information, and the appeal decision period will be extended 5 additional days.
(3)
Issuance of final decision.
The Appeal Deciding Officer shall review the decision and appeal record and issue a written appeal decision to the parties
within 30 days of the close of the appeal period except that this period must be extended to 35 days when additional information is requested by the Appeal Deciding Officer. The Appeal Officer may affirm or reverse the Responsible Official's decision, in whole or in part. There is no extension of the time period for rendering an appeal decision.
(k)
Implementation of decisions during pendency of appeal.
Recomputation of shares arising from a scheduled 5-year recomputation are effective on April 1 following the end of the 5-year period being considered. If an appeal that may affect the shares for the next 5-year period is not resolved by the April 1 date, the share decision announced by the Responsible Official must be implemented. If an appeal decision results in a change in the shares, the revised total share of the Small Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program must be accomplished during the remaining portion of the 5-year period.
(l)
Timber sale set-aside policy changes.
Timber purchasers shall receive an opportunity, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, to review and comment on significant changes in the Small Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program or policy prior to adoption and implementation.
(m)
Information collection requirements.
The provisions of paragraph (f) of this section specify the information that appellants must provide when appealing decisions pertaining to recomputation of shares. As such, these rules contain information requirements as defined in 5 CFR Part 1320. These information requirements have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned control number 0596-0141.

(2) The debarring official may extend a debarment decision to include any affiliates of the purchaser, if they are—
(i) Specifically named and
(ii) Given written notice of the proposed debarment and provided an opportunity to respond (see § 223.138(b)).
(b)
Imputing conduct.
For purposes of determining the scope of debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
(1) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with a purchaser may be imputed to a purchaser when the conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the purchaser, or with the purchaser's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The purchaser's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.
(2) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of a purchaser may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with the purchaser who participated in, knew of, or has reason to know of the purchaser's conduct.
(3) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of one purchaser participating in a joint venture or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participating purchasers if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture or similar arrangement or with the knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of those purchasers. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval or acquiescence.
§ 223.141
Suspension.
(a) The suspending official may, in the public interest, suspend a purchaser on the basis of adequate evidence for any of the causes in § 223.142, using the procedures in § 223.143. However, the existence of a cause for suspension does not necessarily require that the purchaser be suspended. In making any suspension decision, the suspending official shall consider the seriousness of the purchaser's acts or omissions and any mitigating factors.
(b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed, pending the completion of investigation or legal proceedings, when it has been determined that immediate action is necessary to protect the Government's interest. In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, consideration shall be given to how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment shall include an examination of basic documents such as contracts, bids, awards, inspection reports, and correspondence, as appropriate.
§ 223.142
Causes for suspension.
(a) The suspending official may suspend a purchaser suspected, upon adequate evidence, of the following:
(1) Commission of:
(i) Theft, forgery, bribery, embezzlement, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property;
(ii) Fraud, a criminal offense, or violation of Federal or State antitrust laws, any of which occurred in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain; or performing a public contract or subcontract; or
(iii) Any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present responsibility of a purchase of Government timber.
(2) Indictment for any of the causes listed in paragraph (a) of this section constitutes adequate evidence for suspension.
(3) A purchaser's suspension from the purchaser of timber by another Federal agency which sells timber.
(b) The suspending official may, upon adequate evidence, also suspend a purchaser for any other cause so serious or compelling that it affects the present responsibility or a purchaser of Government timber.
§ 223.143
Procedures for suspension.
(a)
Investigation and referral.
Information which may be sufficient cause for suspension under § 223.142 shall be reported to the Forest Service Suspending Official. Generally, such information should be referred through the Forest Supervisor and the Regional Forester. The referral shall be accompanied by a complete statement of the facts supported by appropriate exhibits and a recommendation for action. Where the statement of facts indicates a possible criminal offense, except possible antitrust violations, the suspending official shall notify the Office of Inspector General, USDA. Where the statement of facts indicates a possible antitrust violation, the suspending official shall notify the Antitrust Division, Department of Justice.
(b)
Decisionmaking process
—(1)
Notice of suspension.
When a purchaser and any specifically named affiliates are suspended, the suspending official shall so advise the purchaser and any specifically named affiliate immediately by certified mail, return receipt requested. Such notice shall specify:

(3)
Informal hearing.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, respondent may request an informal hearing with the suspending official. The informal hearing shall be held within 20 calendar days from the date the request is received. The suspending official may postpone the date of the hearing if the respondent requests a postponement in writing. At the hearing, the respondent, appearing personally or through an attorney or other authorized representative, may informally present and explain evidence that causes for suspension do not exist, evidence of any mitigating factors, and arguments concerning the imposition, scope, duration or effects of suspension. A transcript of the informal hearing shall not be required.
(4)
Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts.
(i) If the suspending official finds that there exists a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any person the Forest Service presents, unless—
(A) The action is based on an indictment; or
(B) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice advice, that the substantial interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced.
(ii) If appropriate, the respondent may request a fact-finding conference on disputed material facts. Such a conference shall be held within 20 calendar days from the date the request is received unless mutually agreed otherwise. The fact-finding conference shall
conform with the following requirements:
(A) At least 10 days before the fact-finding conference, the suspending official shall send the respondent a copy of all documents in the administrative record as of the date of transmittal and not objected to by the Department of Justice.
(B) At the conference, the respondent shall have the opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any person the Forest Service presents.
(iii) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be prepared and made available at cost to the respondent upon request, unless the respondent and the Forest Service, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a transcript.
(5)
Suspending official's decision.
The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension or leave it in force for the same reasons as for terminating or reducing the period or extent of debarment (see § 223.139(c)). The decision shall be made in accordance with the following provisions:
(i)
No additional proceedings necessary.
In actions based on an indictment, in which the respondent's submission does not raise a genuine dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of Department of Justice advice, the suspending official's decision shall be based on all the information in the administrative record, including any submissions and argument made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 30 working days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official extends this period for good cause.
(ii)
Additional proceedings necessary.
(A) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed material facts, written findings of fact shall be promptly prepared.

(B) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
(C) The suspending official's decision shall be made only after the conclusion of any proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
(6)
Notice of suspending official's decision.
The purchaser and any affiliates involved shall be given prompt written notice of the suspending officer's decision to continue or not continue the suspension by certified mail, return receipt requested.
§ 223.144
Period of suspension.
(a) Suspension shall be for a temporary period pending the completion of investigation and any ensuing legal proceedings unless sooner terminated by the suspending official or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) If legal proceedings are not initiated within 12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall be terminated unless an Assistant Attorney General requests its extension, in which case it may be extended for an additional 6 months. In no event may a suspension extend beyond 18 months, unless legal proceedings have been initiated within that period.
(c) The suspending official shall notify the Department of Justice of the proposed termination of any suspension, at least 30 days before the 12-month period expires, to give the Department an opportunity to request an extension.
§ 223.145
Scope of suspension.
The scope of suspension shall be the same as that for debarment (see § 223.140), except that the procedures in § 223.143 shall be used in imposing suspension.

§ 223.190
Sourcing area application procedures.
(a) Subject to the restrictions described in § 223.189 of this subpart and, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a person who owns or operates a manufacturing facility and who exports unprocessed timber originating from private lands may apply for a sourcing area in accordance with the procedures of this section. However, an owner/operator of a manufacturing facility who exports unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands may not possess or acquire unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands unless the acquisition is within an approved sourcing area. A person who intends to acquire or become affiliated with a manufacturing facility that processes Federal timber and who is an exporter may apply for a sourcing area. Written proof of the intent to acquire or affiliate must be included in the sourcing area application, signed by the applicant and the person or, in the case of a corporation, the Chief Executive Officer, whose company the applicant intends to acquire or affiliate with. This certification must be on letterhead and must be notarized. A sourcing area application that the Secretary determines would be approved will be granted tentative approval pending final notification by the applicant of acquisition of or affiliation with the manufacturing facility. The tentative approval of the sourcing area will lapse unless the acquisition or affiliation occurs within 30 days of the tentative approval of the sourcing area. A sourcing area is not valid until final approval of the sourcing area. The direct substitution prohibition did not apply to a person who applied for a sourcing area on or before December 20, 1990. A request for modification of an existing sourcing area shall trigger a review pursuant to the procedures and restrictions in § 223.191(e).
(b) As provided in the Act, a person who has requested an exemption or waiver of the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period, pursuant to § 223.189 of this subpart, must have applied for the desired sourcing area on or before December 20, 1990.

(h) A final decision on a sourcing area application or a formal sourcing area review will be issued within four (4) months of the receipt of the application or initiation of the review.
(i) The following criteria must be met for sourcing area approval:
(1) The Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer must find that the proposed sourcing area is geographically and economically separate from any area that the applicant harvests or expects to harvest for export any unprocessed timber originating from private lands. In making such a finding, the Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer shall consider the timber purchasing patterns of the applicant on private and Federal lands equally with those of other persons in the same local vicinity and the relative similarity of such purchasing patterns.
(2) The “same local vicinity” will normally be manufacturing facilities located within 30 miles of the community where the applicant's manufacturing facility is located, but may include more distant communities if manufacturing facilities in those communities depend on the same source of timber and have similar purchasing patterns.
(3) The relative similarity of purchasing patterns of other mills shall be determined by considering the location and similarity of unprocessed timber being acquired by those facilities.
(4) Lines defining the geographic area shall be based on major natural and cultural features, including, but not limited to, prominent ridge systems, main roads or highways, rivers, political subdivisions, and not characterized by random lines.
(j)
Comments.
Persons may submit comments on sourcing area applications pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620,
et seq.
), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M. Persons submitting a comment must certify at the end of the comment, but before the signature, to the following: “I certify that the information provided by me is true and accurate, to the best of my knowledge, and I understand that failure to provide true and accurate information could be violation of the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001).”
(k) Transporting or causing to be transported unprocessed private timber from outside of a sourcing area into a sourcing area by the holder of the sourcing area is prohibited as a violation of the sourcing area boundary. Such violation will cause a review of the sourcing area, and could subject the sourcing area holder to the penalties and remedies for violations of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990, 16 U.S.C. 620,
et seq.,
and its implementing regulations.
(l) A person with an approved sourcing area may relinquish the sourcing area at any time provided the person certifies to the following:
“I am relinquishing the approved sourcing area, described in the Secretary's determination in FSAA ____ on ____, 19__. I understand that I may not export unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States during the fiscal year in which I have unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States in my possession or under contract, pursuant to the prohibition against substitution in the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620,
et seq.
) (“Act”) and its implementing regulations. I also understand that I may not purchase unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States within 24 months of having exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States, pursuant to the prohibitions against substitution in the Act and its implementing regulations. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the Act and its implementing regulations and do fully understand that exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States during a fiscal year in which I have unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States in possession or under contract, or purchasing unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States within 24 months of having exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States is a violation of the substitution provisions of the Act and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation.”
The certificate must be signed by the person making such certification or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive Officer; must be on company letterhead; and must be notarized.
(m) A sourcing area is in effect until it is relinquished by the sourcing area holder, or is disapproved upon review of the sourcing area.
§ 223.191
Sourcing area disapproval and review procedures.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an applicant whose sourcing area application was submitted by December 20, 1990, and was disapproved could either phase out of purchasing Federal timber or phase out of exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the sourcing area that would have been approved, as follows:
(1)
Phase-out of Federal timber purchasing.
The applicant could purchase, in the 9-month period after receiving the application disapproval, unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands in the disapproved sourcing area, in an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the annual average of such person's purchases of unprocessed Federal timber in such area during the 5 full fiscal years immediately prior to the date of submission of the application. In the 6-month period immediately following the 9-month period, such person could purchase not more than 25 percent of such annual average, after which time the prohibitions against direct substitution, set forth in § 223.189 of this subpart, shall apply; or
(2)
Phase-out of private timber exporting.
The applicant could continue to purchase unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands within the disapproved sourcing area without being subject to the phase-out of Federal timber purchasing procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section, if the following requirements were met:
(i) The applicant certified to the Regional Forester or the approving official to whom such authority has been delegated, within 90 days after receiving the disapproval decision, as follows:
(A) An applicant that has exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands from the geographic area that would have been approved provided a signed certification that reads as follows:

§ 223.195
Procedures for identifying and marking unprocessed timber.
(a)
Highway yellow paint.
The use of highway yellow paint on unprocessed logs west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States shall be reserved for identifying logs requiring domestic manufacturing.
(b)
Preserving identification.
All identifying marks placed on an unprocessed log to identify the National Forest System origin of that log and/or to identify the log as requiring domestic processing shall be retained on the log until the log is domestically processed. If the identifying marks are lost, removed, or become unreadable, they shall be replaced. If the log is cut into two or more segments, each segment shall be identified in the same manner as the original log.
(1) A generic log hammer brand, known as a “catch brand”, used to identify ownership, may be used to replace lost, removed, unreadable or otherwise missing brands where such use
is authorized by the Regional Forester and approved by the Contracting Officer. Use of such a catch brand on a log or log segment will signify Federal origin.
(2) The requirement to preserve identification of log pieces shall not apply to logs cut into two or more segments as a part of the mill in-feed process immediately before processing. Log segments that are returned to or placed in storage must be marked on both ends with yellow paint.
(c)
National Forest System logs.
Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, all unprocessed logs originating from National Forest System timber sales west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States shall, before being removed from the timber sale area, be marked on each end as follows:
(1) Painted on each end with a spot of highway yellow paint not less than three square inches in size; and,
(2) Branded on each end with a hammer brand approved for use by the Forest Supervisor of the National Forest from which the logs originate. The brand pattern may not be used to mark logs from any other source for a period of 24 months after all logs have been removed from the sale area and until such brand pattern is released in writing by the Forest Supervisor.
(d)
Private logs.
All unprocessed logs originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States that require domestic manufacturing pursuant to § 223.194 of this subpart, shall be painted on each end with a spot of highway yellow paint not less than three (3) square inches in size before removal from the harvest area. If private logs are acquired by a person who may not export such logs, the logs must be marked by the person acquiring the logs at the time of the acquisition.
(e)
Waiver of painting requirements.
The log painting requirements pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section may be waived if the Chief of the Forest Service determines that alternate methods for identifying logs required to be domestically processed are equal to or better than the procedures required herein.
(f)
Waiver of branding requirements.
Regional Foresters may waive the branding requirements pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section as follows:
(1)
Regions 1, 2, 3, and 4.

et seq.
) (Act) and its implementing regulations at 36 CFR part 223. I fully understand that failure to abide by the terms of the waiver will be a violation of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620,
et seq.
) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation.”;
and,
(iii) The person otherwise complies with the regulations relating to transfers of logs between persons.
(iv) If the Regional Forester determines that unprocessed logs from my origin are being exported, or are known to have been exported within the previous 5 years, by any person from the person's area of operations, the Regional Forester shall revoke the waiver.
(2)
Regions 5 and 6.
On an individual timber sale basis, the branding requirement pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be waived for logs ten (10) inches or less in diameter inside bark on the large end may be waived if:

§ 223.196
Civil penalties for violation.
(a)
Exporting Federal timber.
If the Secretary of Agriculture finds, on the record and after providing an opportunity for a hearing, that a person, with willful disregard for the prohibition in the Act exporting unprocessed Federal timber, exported or caused to be exported unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands in violation of the Act, the Secretary may assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $500,000 for each violation, or 3 times the gross value of the unprocessed timber involved in the violation, whichever amount is greater.
(b)
Other violations.
If the Secretary of Agriculture finds, on the record and after providing an opportunity for a hearing, that a person has violated any provision of the Act, or any regulation issued under the Act relating to National Forest System lands, even though that the violation may not have caused the export of unprocessed Federal timber in violation of such Act, the Secretary may:
(1) Assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $500,000, if the Secretary determines that the person committed such violation willfully;
(2) Assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $75,000 for each violation, if the Secretary determines that the person committed such violation in disregard of such provision or regulation; or
(3) Assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation, if the Secretary determines that the person should have known that the action constituted a violation.
(c)
Penalties not exclusive and judicial review.
A penalty assessed under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall not be exclusive of any other penalty provided by law, and shall be subject to review in an appropriate United States district court.
§ 223.197
Civil penalty assessment procedures.
Adjudicatory procedures for hearing alleged violations of this Act and its implementing regulations and assessing penalties shall be conducted under the rules of practice governing formal adjudicatory proceedings instituted by the Secretary. Such procedures are found at 7 CFR 1.130,
et seq.
§ 223.198
Administrative remedies.
In addition to possible debarment action provided under subpart C of this part, the Chief of the Forest Service, or other official to whom such authority is delegated, may cancel any timber sale contract entered into with a person found to have violated the Act or regulations issued under the Act. Such a finding shall constitute a serious violation of contract terms pursuant to § 223.116(a)(1) of this part.
§ 223.199
Procedures for cooperating with other agencies.
The Regional Foresters may enter into agreements to cooperate with the Department of the Interior, the Department of Defense, and other Federal, State and local agencies for monitoring, surveillance and enforcing the Act.
§ 223.200

§ 223.201
Limitations on unprocessed timber harvested in Alaska.
Unprocessed timber from National Forest System lands in Alaska may not be exported from the United States or shipped to other States without prior approval of the Regional Forester. This requirement is necessary to ensure the development and continued existence of adequate wood processing capacity in Alaska for the sustained utilization of timber from the National Forests which are geographically isolated from other processing facilities. In determining whether consent will be given for the export of timber, consideration will be given to, among other things, whether such export will:
(a) Permit more complete utilization on areas being logged primarily for local manufacture,
(b) Prevent loss or serious deterioration of logs unsalable locally because of an unforeseen loss of market,
(c) Permit the salvage of timber damaged by wind, insects, fire or other catastrophe,
(d) Bring into use a minor species of little importance to local industrial development, or
(e) Provide material required to meet urgent and unusual needs of the Nation. (16 U.S.C. 472a; 16 U.S.C. 551; 16 U.S.C. 616)
§ 223.202

Control Number 0596-0114 has been reapproved by OMB for use through May 31, 1997. OMB approved the information collection requirements in §§ 223.191 and 223.203 for use through August 31, 1995, and assigned them Control Number 0596-0115. OMB approved the information collection requirements in §§ 223.48 and 223.87 for use through March 31, 1997 and assigned them Control Number 0596-0021; the information collection requirements in §§ 223.48 and 223.87 have been revised. OMB Control Numbers 0596-0114, 0596-0115, and 0596-0021 have been consolidated under OMB Control Number 0596-0114.
(b) The application and reporting procedures in §§ 223.187, 223.193, 223.194, 223.195, and some of the procedures in § 223.190 of this final rule contain new record keeping and reporting requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320 and, therefore, impose additional paperwork burdens on the affected public. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved these requirements, and assigned them Control Number 0596-0114.
§ 223.203

§ 223.219
Sustainable harvest of special forest products.
(a)
Sustainable harvest levels.
Prior to offering a special forest product for sale or free use, the responsible forest officer must determine the product's sustainable harvest level. A special forest product's sustainable harvest level is the total quantity of the product that can be harvested annually in perpetuity on a sustained yield basis. Responsible forest officers shall not authorize harvest or free use of special forest products in an amount exceeding known sustainable harvest levels. In determining a sustainable harvest level, the responsible forest officer may consider harvest levels of the product for the previous three years, if such information is available. Responsible forest officers may consider factors such as year-to-year and site-to-site variability, climate, weather change, geographic scale, and scientific data available prior to making their sustainability determination and establishing monitoring time frames consistent with paragraph (c) of this section. Responsible forest officers will consult with Tribes, to the extent appropriate, to determine sustainable harvest levels based on historical information. In addition, responsible forest officers may consult with other appropriate parties to determine sustainable harvest levels based on historical information.
(b)
Harvest of protected species.
The sale or free use of special forest products listed or proposed for listing as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act is prohibited, except as authorized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Moreover, regional guidelines will identify when the sale or free use of any special forest product listed on the Regional Forester's sensitive plant list, species of concern list, species of interest list, or protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species may be authorized.
(c)
Monitoring of established harvest levels.
At least once every three fiscal years, or as otherwise established by the Regional Forester, the Forest Service shall monitor the effects of harvesting on the sustainability of special forest products. Such monitoring may include, but is not limited to, on-site
examination of the product, including both harvested and non-harvested areas, and a review of past and projected harvest levels to the extent such information is available.
(d)
Revision of harvest levels.
The sustainable harvest level for a special forest product may be increased or decreased, as appropriate, based on monitoring.
§ 223.220
Quantity determination.
Sale contracts, permits, or other authorizing instruments may provide for determining the quantity of special forest products by scaling, measuring, weighing, counting, or other reliable means.

# Appraisal and Pricing
§ 223.221
Establishing minimum rates.
The Chief of the Forest Service shall establish minimum rates for the sale of special forest products or groups of special forest products. Products must be sold for appraised value or minimum rates, whichever is higher. No products may be sold or harvested for less than minimum rates except to provide for the removal of insect infested, diseased, dead or distressed products.
§ 223.222
Appraisal.
The Chief of the Forest Service shall determine the appraised value of special forest products. Valid methods to determine appraised value include, but are not limited to, transaction evidence appraisals, analytical appraisals, comparison appraisals, and independent estimates based on average investments. Special forest products must be sold at minimum rates or appraised value, whichever is higher.

# Contract and Permit Conditions and Provisions
§ 223.223
Advance payment.
Contracts, permits, or other authorizing instruments for the sale of special forest products shall require advance payment, unless the contract, permit, or instrument authorizes the person to furnish a payment guarantee satisfactory to the Forest Service. Advance payments found to be in excess of amounts due the United States shall be refunded to the person or their successor in interest, subject to the requirements of the Debt Collection Improvement Act.
§ 223.224
Performance bonds and security.
A contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument for the sale of special forest products may require the person to furnish a performance bond or other security for satisfactory compliance with its terms.
§ 223.225
Term.
The term of any contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument for the sale of special forest products shall not exceed 10 years, unless the Secretary of Agriculture finds that better utilization of the various forest resources consistent with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, as amended (16 U.S.C. 528-531) will result. Any such finding by the Secretary of Agriculture shall be made in writing.
§ 223.226
Term adjustments for force majeure delay.
Contracts or other authorizing instruments for the sale of special forest products, excluding permits, may contain a provision allowing the term to be extended if circumstances beyond the person's reasonable control delay performance. In determining whether such an extension is appropriate, responsible forest officers shall consider the value of the products or species, the length and type of authorizing instrument, the need for early/accelerated harvest, and any other appropriate factors. Circumstances beyond a person's reasonable control may include, but are not limited to, acts of God, acts of the public enemy, acts of the Government, labor disputes, fires, insurrections, and floods. The responsible forest officer may grant such an extension upon finding:
(a) Circumstances beyond the person's reasonable control delayed performance; and
(b) The person has diligently performed in accordance with the contract or other authorizing instrument.

In any resale of special forest products remaining from a previous sale, the Forest Service shall not consider a bid submitted by a person who failed to complete or defaulted the original contract, permit, or other instrument authorizing the sale, or from any affiliate of such person, except when such consideration serves the public interest.
§ 223.231
Bidding methods.
The Contracting Officer or designated forest officer shall offer advertised sales of special forest products through sealed bid or sealed bid followed by oral auction. The method selected shall:
(a) Ensure open and fair competition;
(b) Ensure that the Federal Government receives minimum rates or appraised value, whichever is higher;
(c) Be consistent with the National Forest Management Act and other applicable federal laws;
(d) Require, as a prerequisite to participation in an oral auction, that a bidder submit a written sealed bid at least equal to the minimum acceptable bid price(s) specified in the prospectus.

§ 223.233
Award to highest bidder.
(a) The Forest Service shall award contracts, permits, or other authorizing instruments for advertised sales as follows:
(1) The Forest Service will award a special forest products sale to the responsible bidder that submits the highest bid that conforms to the sale conditions in the prospectus.
(2) If the highest bidder cannot meet the conditions for the sale, as specified in the prospectus, the Forest Service may:
(i) Reject all bids and reoffer the sale, or
(ii) Offer the award at the high bid level to the next highest qualified bidder until the award is accepted or refused by all of the conforming bidders.
(iii) In the event of a tie between two or more responsible high bidders submitting conforming bids, the Forest Service shall award the sale by drawing of lots.
(iv) If no bids meet the specified conditions in the sale's prospectus, or if there are other irregularities in the bidding process, the Forest Service may reject all bids, and, at its discretion, reoffer the sale.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 223.234
Determination of responsibility.
(a) A Contracting Officer shall not award a contract, permit, or other instrument authorizing the sale of special forest products to a declared high bidder unless that officer makes an affirmative determination that the person is responsible. In the absence of information clearly establishing that the declared high bidder is responsible, the Contracting Officer shall conclude that the declared high bidder is not responsible.
(b) In order to make an affirmative determination of responsibility, the Contracting Officer must find that:
(1) The declared high bidder has adequate financial resources to perform the contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument, or the ability to obtain such resources;
(2) The declared high bidder is able to complete the contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument within the relevant term, taking into consideration the declared high bidder's other existing commercial and governmental obligations;
(3) The declared high bidder has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;
(4) The declared high bidder has or is able to obtain equipment and supplies suitable for harvesting the special forest product(s) and for meeting applicable resource protection requirements;
(5) The declared high bidder is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award of a contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument under all applicable laws and regulations;
(6) The declared high bidder has a satisfactory performance record on contracts, permits, and other agreements with the U.S. Government. Failure to apply sufficient diligence and perseverance to perform a contract, permit, or other instrument is strong
evidence that a declared high bidder is not responsible. A declared high bidder that is, or has been deficient in performance shall be deemed not responsible, unless the declared high bidder demonstrates that the deficiency arose from circumstances beyond their reasonable control.
(c) Affiliated concerns, as defined in 36 CFR 223.49(a)(5), are normally considered separate entities in determining whether the declared high bidder that is to perform the contract meets the applicable standards for responsibility. However, the responsible Forest Officer shall consider an affiliate's past performance and integrity when they may adversely affect the responsibility of the declared high bidder.

§ 223.238
Free use authorization to U.S. Army and Navy.
Subject to delegations of authority by the Chief, Regional Foresters may approve the harvest of special forest products by the U.S. Army and Navy for the purposes identified at 16 U.S.C. 492.
§ 223.239
Free use by individuals.
(a)
Free use.
A person may harvest a special forest product from National Forest System lands free of charge for personal, non-commercial use up to the amount or quantity authorized by a designated Forest Service officer, a Forest Supervisor, or a Regional Forester, as delegated at 36 CFR 223.8.
(b)
Free use without a permit up to the incidental use harvest level.
No permit is required for the free use of a special forest product at or below that product's incidental-use harvest level, which shall be determined at the discretion of the regional forester or a subordinate officer. The incidental use harvest level covers small amounts of special forest products, such as cones, mushrooms, berries, acorns, black walnuts, or medicinal roots. Any free use of a special forest product that does not have an incidental-use harvest level is subject to this section's permit requirements.
(c)
Free-use permit requirement.
No person seeking free use of a special forest product, except one identified in § 223.239(e), may harvest a special forest product above the product's incidental-
use harvest level without submitting an application to a forest officer and obtaining a free-use permit, unless the permit requirement has been waived for a specific special forest product in a designated free-use area.
(d)
Contents of the permit.
The permit shall indicate the type, amount, and/or value of the product to be harvested, the permit's duration, and shall contain other restrictions and requirements as appropriate.
(e)
Free use without a permit for members of Tribes with treaty or other reserved rights related to special forest products.
A member of a Tribe with treaty or other reserved rights related to special forest products retains his/her ability to harvest such products in full accordance with existing rights, including free-use harvest without obtaining a free-use permit, as specified in treaty or other reserved rights.
(f)
Free use without a permit upon the request of the governing body of a Tribe.
At the Agency's discretion, responsible forest officers may, upon the request of an authorized representative of the governing body of a Tribe, issue a permit that would not otherwise be required under paragraph (e) of this section to a Tribe with treaty or other reserved rights related to special forest products for the free use of a specified quantity of special forest products. That Tribe may then allocate specified quantities of the special forest product(s) to individual Tribal members, up to the maximum amount specified in the Tribal free-use permit. Any Tribe issued such a permit must provide the Forest Service with information related to the permitted harvest, upon request.
(g)
Free-use restrictions.
A Forest Officer may set conditions on the free-use harvest of a special forest product or deny the free use of a special forest product. Reasons for denying free-use access or setting conditions on free use, except as specified in § 223.240, may include, but are not limited to:
(1) Ensuring public safety;
(2) Preventing interference with Forest Service and/or commercial operations;
(3) Ensuring the sustainability of a special forest product; or
(4) Otherwise protecting National Forest System land.
(h)

# Subpart A—Locatable Minerals
§ 228.1
Purpose.
It is the purpose of these regulations to set forth rules and procedures through which use of the surface of National Forest System lands in connection with operations authorized by the United States mining laws (30 U.S.C. 21-54), which confer a statutory right to enter upon the public lands to search for minerals, shall be conducted so as to minimize adverse environmental impacts on National Forest System surface resources. It is not the purpose of these regulations to provide for the management of mineral resources; the responsibility for managing such resources is in the Secretary of the Interior.
§ 228.2
Scope.
These regulations apply to operations hereafter conducted under the United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22
et seq.
), as they affect surface resources on all National Forest System lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture to which such laws are applicable:
Provided, however,
That any area of National Forest lands covered by a special Act of Congress (16 U.S.C. 482a-482q) is subject to the provisions of this part and the provisions of the special act, and in the case of conflict the provisions of the special act shall apply.
§ 228.3
Definitions.
For the purposes of this part the following terms, respectively, shall mean:
(a)
Operations.
All functions, work, and activities in connection with prospecting, exploration, development, mining or processing of mineral resources and all uses reasonably incident thereto, including roads and other means of access on lands subject to the regulations in this part, regardless of whether said operations take place on or off mining claims.
(b)
Operator.
A person conducting or proposing to conduct operations.
(c)
Person.
Any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity.
(d)
Mining claim.
Any unpatented mining claim or unpatented millsite authorized by the United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22
et seq.
).
(e)
Authorized officer.
The Forest Service officer to whom authority to review and approve operating plans has been delegated.
§ 228.4
Plan of operations—notice of intent—requirements.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a notice of intent to operate is required from any person proposing to conduct operations which might cause significant disturbance of surface resources. Such notice of intent to operate shall be submitted to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which the operations will be conducted. Each notice of intent to operate shall provide information sufficient to identify the area involved, the nature of the proposed operations, the route of access to the area of operations, and the method of transport.
(1) A notice of intent to operate is not required for:
(i) Operations which will be limited to the use of vehicles on existing public roads or roads used and maintained for National Forest System purposes;
(ii) Prospecting and sampling which will not cause significant surface resource disturbance and will not involve removal of more than a reasonable amount of mineral deposit for analysis and study which generally might include searching for and occasionally removing small mineral samples or specimens, gold panning, metal detecting, non-motorized hand sluicing, using battery operated dry washers, and collecting of mineral specimens using hand tools;
(iii) Marking and monumenting a mining claim;
(iv) Underground operations which will not cause significant surface resource disturbance;
(v) Operations, which in their totality, will not cause surface resource disturbance which is substantially different than that caused by other users of the National Forest System who are not required to obtain a Forest Service special use authorization, contract, or other written authorization;
(vi) Operations which will not involve the use of mechanized earthmoving equipment, such as bulldozers or backhoes, or the cutting of trees, unless those operations otherwise might cause a significant disturbance of surface resources; or
(vii) Operations for which a proposed plan of operations is submitted for approval;
(2) The District Ranger will, within 15 days of receipt of a notice of intent to operate, notify the operator if approval of a plan of operations is required before the operations may begin.
(3) An operator shall submit a proposed plan of operations to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which operations will be conducted in lieu of a notice of intent to operate if the proposed operations will likely cause a significant disturbance of surface resources. An operator also shall submit a proposed plan of operations, or a proposed supplemental plan of operations consistent with § 228.4(d), to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which operations are being conducted if those operations are causing a significant disturbance of surface resources but are not covered by a current approved plan of operations. The requirement to submit a plan of operations shall not apply to the operations listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (v). The requirement to submit a plan of operations also shall not apply to operations which will not involve the use of mechanized earthmoving equipment, such as bulldozers or backhoes, or the cutting of trees, unless those operations otherwise will likely cause a significant disturbance of surface resources.
(4) If the District Ranger determines that any operation is causing or will likely cause significant disturbance of surface resources, the District Ranger shall notify the operator that the operator must submit a proposed plan of operations for approval and that the operations can not be conducted until a plan of operations is approved.
(b) Any person conducting operations on the effective date of these regulations, who would have been required to submit a plan of operations under § 228.4(a), may continue operations but shall within 120 days thereafter submit a plan of operations to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area within which operations are being conducted:
Provided, however,
That upon a showing of good cause the authorized officer will grant an extension of time for submission of a plan of operations, not to exceed an additional 6 months. Operations may continue according to the submitted plan during its review, unless the authorized officer determines that the operations are unnecessarily or unreasonably causing irreparable damage to surface resources and advises the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage. Upon approval of a plan of operations, operations shall be conducted in accordance with the approved plan. The requirement to submit a plan of operations shall not apply: (1) To operations excepted in § 228.4(a) or (2) to operations concluded prior to the effective date of the regulations in this part.
(c) The plan of operations shall include:
(1) The name and legal mailing address of the operators (and claimants if they are not the operators) and their lessees, assigns, or designees.
(2) A map or sketch showing information sufficient to locate the proposed area of operations on the ground, existing and/or proposed roads or access routes to be used in connection with the operations as set forth in § 228.12 and the approximate location and size of areas where surface resources will be disturbed.
(3) Information sufficient to describe or identify the type of operations proposed and how they would be conducted, the type and standard of existing and proposed roads or access routes, the means of transportation used or to be used as set forth in § 228.12, the period during which the proposed activity will take place, and measures to be taken to meet the requirements for environmental protection in § 228.8.
(d) The plan of operations shall cover the requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, as foreseen for the entire operation for the full estimated period of activity:
Provided, however,
That if the development of a plan for an entire operation is not possible at the time of preparation of a plan, the operator shall file an initial plan setting forth his proposed operation to the degree reasonably foreseeable at that time, and shall thereafter file a supplemental plan or plans whenever it is proposed to undertake any significant surface disturbance not covered by the initial plan.
(e) At any time during operations under an approved plan of operations, the authorized officer may ask the operator to furnish a proposed modification of the plan detailing the means of minimizing unforeseen significant disturbance of surface resources. If the operator does not furnish a proposed modification within a time deemed reasonable by the authorized officer, the authorized officer may recommend to his immediate superior that the operator be required to submit a proposed modification of the plan. The recommendation of the authorized officer shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in detail the supporting facts and reasons for his recommendations. In acting upon such recommendation, the immediate superior of the authorized officer shall determine:
(1) Whether all reasonable measures were taken by the authorized officer to predict the environmental impacts of the proposed operations prior to approving the operating plan,
(2) Whether the disturbance is or probably will become of such significance as to require modification of the operating plan in order to meet the requirements for environmental protection specified in § 228.8 and
(3) Whether the disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means. Lacking such determination that unforeseen significant disturbance of surface resources is occurring or probable and that the disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means, no operator shall be required to submit a proposed modification of an approved plan of operations. Operations may continue in accordance with the approved plan until a modified plan is approved, unless the immediate superior of the authorized officer determines that the operations are unnecessarily or unreasonably causing irreparable injury, loss or damage to surface resources and advises the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage.
(f) Upon completion of an environmental analysis in connection with each proposed operating plan, the authorized officer will determine whether an environmental statement is required. Not every plan of operations, supplemental plan or modification will involve the preparation of an environmental statement. Environmental impacts will vary substantially depending on whether the nature of operations is prospecting, exploration, development, or processing, and on the scope of operations (such as size of operations, construction required, length of operations and equipment required), resulting in varying degrees of disturbance to vegetative resources, soil, water, air, or wildlife. The Forest Service will prepare any environmental statements that may be required.
(g) The information required to be included in a notice of intent or a plan of operations, or supplement or modification thereto, has been assigned Office of Management and Budget Control #0596-0022. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from a few minutes for an activity involving little or no surface disturbance to several months for activities involving heavy capital investments and significant surface disturbance, with an average of 2 hours per individual response. This includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief (2800), Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, DC 20090-6090 and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

disposals from community sites and common-use areas.
§ 228.48
Appraisal and measurement.
(a)
Appraisal.
All mineral materials for sale must be appraised to determine fair market value. Appraisals must be based on knowledge of the extent of the deposit, quality of material, and economic value. A sale must not be made at less than the appraised value which may be expressed as either price per cubic yard or weight equivalent. In all cases the units of measurement must correspond to the units used in the appraisal. The authorized officer must estimate and record the amount and value of minerals to be disposed of by free-use permit.
(b)
Measurement.
The amount of mineral material actually removed may be measured by volume, weight, truck tally, by combination of these methods, or by such other form of measurement as the authorized officer determines to be appropriate and in the public interest.
§ 228.49
Reappraisal.
If an extension of time is granted as provided in § 228.53(b), the authorized officer must reappraise or reestimate the mineral materials covered by the contract or permit and which remain unexcavated at the time of extension. The recalculated unit value becomes the new unit value for the remaining unexcavated material; excavated and stockpiled material is not subject to reappraisal.
§ 228.50
Production records.
At least annually, the purchaser or permittee must furnish a record of the volume extracted, in cubic yards or weight equivalent, to the authorized officer. The units of measurement must correspond to the units used in the appraisal or estimate.
§ 228.51
Bonding.
(a)
Bond requirements.
Before operations may begin under any contract or permit, a bond must be furnished to the authorized officer to ensure performance of payment (as necessary), reclamation, and other conditions of the contract or permit, except as noted in paragraphs (a) (1) and (3) of this section, where the authorized officer may waive such bonding. If an extension of time is granted as provided in § 228.53(b), the bond requirements must be recalculated and changed accordingly.
(1) For
advance payment contracts
for 10,000 cubic yards or more in volume (or weight equivalent), a bond of not less than 10 percent of the total contract price or the value of the estimated annual production (whichever is less), plus the reclamation cost for the area covered by annual mining, is required. When the total volume is less than 10,000 cubic yards, bond requirements, if any, are at the discretion of the authorized officer.
(2) For any
deferred payment contract,
a bond equaling the value of the estimated annual production plus the reclamation cost for the area covered by annual mining is required.
(3) For
free use,
the authorized officer may require a reclamation bond which must be sufficient to cover the cost of reclamation of the anticipated annual work.
(b)
Types of bonding.
A bond must be one of the following:
(1) A bond of a corporate surety shown on the latest approved list issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and executed on an approved standard form;
(2) A cash bond;
(3) Negotiable securities of the United States;
(4) An irrevocable letter of credit acceptable to the Forest Service;
(5) A performance bond required by other Forest Service contracts or permits, provided the bond covers the performance and reclamation requirements related to the removal of mineral material from a designated pit or area for use in the performance of the contract or permit; or
(6) Any other types of bond specified in the Forest Service Manual.
§ 228.52
Assignments.
(a)
Limitations.
A purchaser or permittee may not assign the contract or permit, or any interest therein, without the written approval of the authorized officer.
(b)
Requirements of assignee.
The authorized officer will not approve any
proposed assignment involving contract or permit performance unless the assignee:
(1) Submits information necessary to assure the authorized officer of the assignee's ability to meet the same requirements as the original purchaser or permittee (assignor); and
(2) Furnishes a bond or obtains a commitment from the previous surety to be bound by the assignment when approved.
(c)
Rights and obligations.
Once the authorized officer approves an assignment, the assignee is entitled to all the rights and is subject to all of the obligations under the contract or permit, and the original purchaser or permittee may be released from any further responsibility under the contract or permit.
§ 228.53
Term.
(a)
Time allowed.
Except as provided in § 228.61(f), § 228.62(b), and elsewhere in this paragraph, a contract or permit may not exceed 1 year from the effective date of the contract or permit unless a written extension is obtained. For those mineral materials sold under a duration of production contract or under a contract for the sale of all mineral material within a specified area, or under a construction contract where removal cannot reasonably take place before completion of other work under the same contract, the authorized officer will establish a reasonable time period for removal.
(b)
Extension of time.
If it is shown that a delay in removal was due to causes beyond the control of the purchaser or permittee, the authorized officer may grant an extension, not to exceed 1 year, upon written request. Written requests for extensions of contracts must be received between 30 and 90 days before the expiration date of the contract. Written requests for extensions of permits must be received between 15 and 90 days before the permit expiration date. The authorized officer may grant a total of two extensions for contracts and permits.
§ 228.54
Single entry sales or permits.
The purchaser or permittee is required to reclaim a single entry source in accordance with an approved operating plan which describes operating procedures and reclamation measures, unless the requirement is waived by the authorized officer.
§ 228.55
Cancellation or suspension.
The authorized officer may cancel or suspend a contract, permit, or prospecting permit if the purchaser or permittee fails to comply with its terms and conditions. If the noncompliance is unnecessarily or unreasonably causing injury, loss, or damage to surface resources, the authorized officer may cancel or suspend the contract, permit, or prospecting permit immediately. In cases where noncompliance is of a less serious nature, the authorized officer may cancel or suspend a contract, permit, or prospecting permit if such noncompliance continues for 30 days after service of written notice by the authorized officer. If the noncompliance is not corrected, the authorized officer may attach the bond to ensure compliance with the provisions of the contract, permit, or prospecting permit.
§ 228.56
Operating plans.
Any surface-disturbing operation under a contract, permit, or prospecting permit is subject to prior approval by the authorized officer of an operating plan and to reasonable conditions as may be required to ensure proper protection of the environment and improvements, including timely reclamation of disturbed lands. Significant changes to operations require prior approval of an amended operating plan. The operating plan must include, as a minimum, a map and explanation of the nature of the access, anticipated activity, surface disturbance, and intended reclamation including removal or retention of structures and facilities. Operating plans must be submitted by the purchaser, permittee, or prospecting permittee, except as noted in § 228.64(b).

# Types and Methods of Disposal
§ 228.57
Types of disposal.
Except as provided in § 228.41(b), disposal of mineral materials may be made by:

Competitive sale
to the highest qualified bidder after formal advertising and other appropriate public notice;
(b)
Sale by negotiated contract.
(1) For removal of materials to be used in connection with a public works improvement program on behalf of a Federal, State, or local government agency if the public exigency will not permit delays incident to advertising, or
(2) For the removal of mineral materials for which it is impracticable to obtain competition;
(c)
Preference right negotiated sale
to the holder of a Forest Service-issued prospecting permit under which a suitable mineral material deposit has been demonstrated on acquired National Forest lands;
(d)
Free use
when a permit is issued to any nonprofit association, corporation, individual, or others listed in § 228.62(d), for other than commercial purposes, resale, or barter, or to any Federal, State, county, local unit, subdivision, municipality, or county road district for use in public projects; or
(e)
Forest Service force account or by contract
where the material is to be used to carry out various Forest Service programs involving construction and maintenance of physical improvements.
§ 228.58
Competitive sales.
(a)
Invitation for bid.
Sales must be conducted as described below after inviting competitive bids through publication and posting. The authorized officer may not offer a competitive sale unless there is a right-of-way or other access to the sale area which is available to anyone qualified to bid.
(b)
Advertising
—(1)
Sales over 25,000 cubic yards.
Mineral material sales offered by competitive bidding and which exceed 25,000 cubic yards must be advertised on the same day once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the material is located, and in a trade or industrial newspaper when considered appropriate. Notice of the sale must be posted in a conspicuous place in the office where bids are to be submitted. In addition, the authorized officer may send the advertisement directly to known interested persons. Bids may be received but not evaluated before the end of the advertising period, which may be extended at the discretion of the authorized officer.
(2)
Content of advertising.
The advertisement of sale must specify the location by legal description of the tract or tracts or by any other means identify the location of the mineral material deposit being offered, the kind of material, estimated quantities, the unit of measurement, appraised price (which sets the minimum acceptable bid), time and place for receiving and opening of bids, minimum deposit required, major special constraints due to environmental considerations, available access, maintenance required over haul routes, traffic controls, required use permits, required qualifications of bidders, the method of bidding, bonding requirement, notice of the right to reject any or all bids, the office where a copy of the contract and additional information may be obtained, and additional information the authorized officer deems necessary.
(3)
Advertising smaller sales.
Advertisement of mineral materials amounting to 25,000 cubic yards in volume (or weight equivalent) or less must be published and/or posted. The methods of advertisement are at the discretion of the authorized officer.
(c)
Conduct of sales.
(1) Bidding at competitive sales may be conducted by the submission of written sealed bids, oral bids, or a combination of both as directed by the authorized officer. In the event of a tie in high sealed bids, the highest bidder will be determined by oral auction among those tied bidders; when no oral bid is higher that the sealed bids, the selected bidder will be determined by lot, the purchase price being the amount of the tied bid. For all oral auctions, including those used to break sealed-bid ties, the high bidder must confirm the bid in writing immediately upon being declared the high bidder. The authorized officer must mail notification of the bidding results to all bidders within 10 days.
(2) The authorized officer may require bidders to furnish evidence of qualification at the time of award or, if
such evidence has already been furnished and is still valid, make appropriate reference to the record containing it.
(3) When it is in the interest of the United States to do so, the authorized officer may reject any or all bids.
(d)
Bid deposits and award of contract.
Sealed bids must be accompanied by a deposit. For mineral materials offered at oral auction, bidders must make the deposit before opening of the bidding.
(1) Bid deposits must be equal to 10 percent of the appraised value but not less than $100.00.
(2) Bid deposits must be in the form of cash, money order, bank drafts, cashier's or certified checks made payable to the Forest Service, or bonds acceptable to the Forest Service (§ 228.51(b)).
(3) Upon conclusion of the bidding, the authorized officer will return the deposits of all unsuccessful bidders. The successful bidder's deposit will be applied toward the purchase price. If the contract is not awarded to the high bidder due to an inability to perform the obligations of the contract, the deposit, less expenses and damages incurred by the United States, may be returned. The return of a deposit does not prejudice any other rights or remedies of the United States. The contract may be offered and awarded to the next successive qualified high bidder, or, at the discretion of the authorized officer, the sale may be either readvertised or negotiated if it is determined that a competitive sale is impracticable.
(4) Within 30 days after receipt of the contract, the successful bidder must sign and return the contract, together with any required bond, unless the authorized officer has granted an extension for an additional 30 days. The bidder must apply for the extension in writing within the first 30-day period. If the successful bidder fails to return the contract within the first 30-day period or within an approved extension, the bid deposit, less the costs of readvertising and damages, may be returned without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the United States.
(5) All sales must be processed on Forest Service-approved contract forms. The authorized officer may add provisions to the contract to cover conditions peculiar to the sale area. Such additional provisions must be made available for inspection by prospective bidders during the advertising period.
§ 228.59
Negotiated or noncompetitive sales.
(a)
Volume limitations.
When it is determined by the authorized officer to be in the public interest and when it is impracticable to obtain competition, mineral materials not exceeding 100,000 cubic yards in volume (or weight equivalent) may be sold in any one sale at not less than the appraised value, without advertising or calling for bids, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

Any application for extension must be submitted no later than 30 days before the expiration of the permit. The application for extension must provide evidence of diligence and state the reasons why additional time is considered necessary to complete prospecting work.
(f)
Refusal to extend permits.
The authorized officer may reject applications for extension of prospecting permits for the following reasons:
(1)
Failure to perform.
Failure of the permittee to perform prospecting or exploration work without adequate justification may result in the denial of an extension; or
(2)
Failure to apply.
If an application for extension is not submitted within the specified period, the permit may expire without notice to the permittee.
(3)
Public interest.
If the authorized officer determines that an extension may not be in the public interest, the application may be rejected.
§ 228.61
Preference right negotiated sales.
(a)
Qualification for sale.
When applying for a preference right negotiated sale, the permittee must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the authorized officer that a suitable deposit of mineral material has been discovered within the area covered by the prospecting permit. Information concerning trade secrets and financial matters submitted by the permittee and identified as confidential will not be available for
public examination except as otherwise agreed upon by the permittee.
(b)
Application for sale.
The application must be submitted to the District Ranger's office on or before the expiration date of the prospecting permit or its extension. The authorized officer may grant 30 additional days for submitting the application if requested in writing by the permittee before expiration of the prospecting permit or its extension.
(c)

Free-use areas may be designated within which a permit may not be required. Removal of material from such areas must be in accord with rules issued by the authorized officer and posted on the area. Such rules must also be posted in the District Ranger's and Forest Supervisor's offices and be available upon request. The rules may vary by area depending on the quantity, quality, and accessibility of the material and the demand for it.
§ 228.63
Removal under terms of a timber sale or other Forest Service contract.
In carrying out programs such as timber sales that involve construction and maintenance of various physical improvements, the Forest Service may specify that mineral materials be mined, manufactured, and/or processed for incorporation into the improvement. Where the mineral material is located on National Forest lands and is designated in the contract calling for its use, no permit is required as long as an operating plan as described in § 228.56 is required by the contract provisions. Title to any excavated material in excess of that needed to fulfill contract requirements revests in the United States without reimbursement to the contract holder or to agents or representatives of the contract holder. Such excess material may be disposed of under §§ 228.58, 228.59, or 228.62.
§ 228.64

Payment for sales.
(a)
Conditions.
Mineral materials may not be removed from the sale area until all conditions of payment in the contract have been met.
(b)
Advance payment.
(1) For negotiated and competitive sales the full amount may be paid before removal is begun under the contract or by installment at the discretion of the authorized officer. Installment payments must be based on the estimated removal rate specified in the operating plan and must be, as a minimum, the value of 1 month's removal. The first installment must be paid before removal operations are begun; remaining installments must be paid in advance of removal of the remaining materials as billed by the authorized officer. The total amount of the purchase price must be paid at least 60 days before the expiration date of the contract.
(2) All advance payment contracts must provide for reappraisal of the mineral material at the time of contract renewal or extension.
(3) Minimum annual production must be sufficient to return a payment to the United States equal to the first installment. In lieu of minimum production, there must be an annual payment
in the amount of the first installment which will not be credited to future years' production. Payments for or in lieu of minimum annual production must be received by the authorized officer on or before the anniversary of the effective date of the contract.
(4) If the purchaser fails to make payments when due, the contract will be considered breached, the authorized officer will cancel the contract, and all previous payments will be forfeited without prejudice to any other rights and remedies of the United States.
(5) In order to determine payment amount, the purchaser must make a report of operations. The report must include the amount of mineral material removed, which must be verified by the authorized officer.
(c)
Deferred payments.

(a)
Payment in excess of value.
If the total payment exceeds the value of the mineral material removed, unless it is the minimum annual payment in lieu of production;
(b)
Insufficiency of material.
If insufficient mineral material existed in the sale area to provide the quantity of material estimated to have been available;
(c)
Cancellation.
(1) If the contract is cancelled by the authorized officer for reasons which are beyond the purchaser's control; or
(2) If the contract is cancelled by mutual agreement. This refund provision is not a warranty that a specific quantity of material exists in the sale area.

(4) Lands within areas allocated for wilderness or further planning in Executive Communication 1504, Ninety-Sixth Congress (House Document No. 96-119), unless such lands subsequently have been allocated to uses other than wilderness by an approved Forest land and resource management plan or have been released to uses other than wilderness by an act of Congress.
(c)
Leasing analyses.
The leasing analysis shall be conducted by the authorized Forest officer in accordance with the requirements of 36 CFR part 219 (Forest land and resource management planning) and/or, as appropriate, through preparation of NEPA documents. As part of the analysis, the authorized Forest officer shall:
(1) Identify on maps those areas that will be:
(i) Open to development subject to the terms and conditions of the standard oil and gas lease form (including an explanation of the typical standards and objectives to be enforced under the standard lease terms);
(ii) Open to development but subject to constraints that will require the use of lease stipulations such as those prohibiting surface use on areas larger than 40 acres or such other standards as may be developed in the plan for stipulation use (with discussion as to why the constraints are necessary and justifiable); and
(iii) Closed to leasing, distinguishing between those areas that are being closed through exercise of management direction, and those closed by law, regulation, etc.
(2) Identify alternatives to the areas listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, including that of not allowing leasing.
(3) Project the type/amount of post-leasing activity that is reasonably foreseeable as a consequence of conducting a leasing program consistent with that described in the proposal and for each alternative.
(4) Analyze the reasonable foreseeable impacts of post-leasing activity projected under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(d)
Area or Forest-wide leasing decisions (lands administratively available for leasing).
Upon completion of the leasing analysis, the Regional Forest shall promptly notify the Bureau of Land Management as to the area or Forest-wide leasing decisions that have been made, that is, identify lands which have been found administratively available for leasing.
(e)

65 FR 57549, Sept. 25, 2000, unless otherwise noted.
§ 230.20
Scope and authority.
The Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program is authorized by Section 9 of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978, as amended (16 U.S.C. 2105). The scope of this authority includes the provision of technical,
financial, and related assistance to State and local governments, non-profits, and other members of the public to: maintain, expand, and preserve forest and tree cover; expand research and education efforts related to trees and forest cover; enhance technical skills and understanding of tree maintenance and practices involving cultivation of trees, shrubs and complementary ground covers; and implementing a tree planting program to complement urban tree maintenance and open space programs. The Secretary has delegated the authority for implementing the program to the Chief of the Forest Service under 7 CFR 2.60(a)(16).
§ 230.21
Implementation of the program.
(a) The Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program is implemented through the Forest Service Grants, Cooperative Agreements, and Other Agreements Program (FSM 1580) and the Grants, Cooperative Agreements, and Other Agreements Handbook (FSH 1509.11). The Forest Service Manual and Handbook are available from the Forest Service internet homepage or at National Forest offices.
(b) The Forest Service, under the authority of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 and through the Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program, coordinates financial, technical, and related assistance with the Natural Resources Conservation Service for the Urban Resources Partnership initiative. The Natural Resources Conservation Service provides similar assistance through the Urban Resources Partnership initiative under the authority of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590a-590f). The Urban Resources Partnership is an initiative in which Federal agencies, in cooperation with State and local agencies, community groups, and non-governmental organizations endeavor to be more effective, responsive, and efficient in working together to protect, improve, and rehabilitate the environment in urban areas of the Nation. The Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service implement the Urban Resources Partnership initiative under the “Urban Resources Partnership National Guidance for U.S. Department of Agriculture Personnel” and applicable agency and departmental procedures for Federal grants and cooperative agreements. Copies of the Guidance may be obtained from the Cooperative Forestry Staff, Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, DC 20090-6090.

§ 242.5
Eligibility for subsistence use.
(a) You may take fish and wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses only if you are an Alaska resident of a rural area or rural community. The regulations in this part may further limit your qualifications to harvest fish or wildlife resources for subsistence uses. If you are not an Alaska resident or are a resident of a non-rural area or community listed in § 242.23, you may not take fish or wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses under the regulations in this part.
(b) Where the Board has made a customary and traditional use determination regarding subsistence use of a specific fish stock or wildlife population, in accordance with, and as listed in, § 242.24, only those Alaskans who are residents of rural areas or communities designated by the Board are eligible for subsistence taking of that population or stock on public lands for subsistence uses under the regulations in this part. If you do not live in one of those areas or communities, you may not take fish or wildlife from that population or stock, on public lands under the regulations in this part.
(c) Where customary and traditional use determinations for a fish stock or wildlife population within a specific area have not yet been made by the Board (e.g., “no determination”), all Alaskans who are residents of rural areas or communities may harvest for subsistence from that stock or population under the regulations in this part.
(d) The National Park Service may regulate further the eligibility of those individuals qualified to engage in subsistence uses on National Park Service lands in accordance with specific authority in ANILCA, and National Park Service regulations at 36 CFR Part 13.
§ 242.6
Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and reports.
(a) If you wish to take fish and wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses, you must be an eligible rural Alaska resident and:
(1) Possess the pertinent valid Alaska resident hunting and trapping licenses (no license required to take fish or shellfish, but you must be an Alaska resident) unless Federal licenses are required or unless otherwise provided for in subpart D of this part;
(2) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent Federal permits (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Harvester Permit) required by subpart D of this part; and
(3) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent permits, harvest tickets, or tags required by the State unless any of these documents or individual provisions in them are superseded by the requirements in subpart D of this part.
(b) In order to receive a Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Harvester Permit or designate someone to harvest fish or wildlife for you under a Federal Designated Harvester Permit, you must be old enough to reasonably harvest that species yourself (or under the guidance of an adult).
(c) If you have been awarded a permit to take fish and wildlife, you must have that permit in your possession during the taking and must comply with all requirements of the permit and the regulations in this section pertaining to validation and reporting and to regulations in subpart D of this part pertaining to methods and means, possession and transportation, and utilization. Upon the request of a State or Federal law enforcement agent, you must also produce any licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, or other documents required by this section. If you are engaged in taking fish and wildlife under the regulations in this part, you must allow State or Federal law enforcement agents to inspect any apparatus designed to be used, or capable of being used to take fish or wildlife, or any fish or wildlife in your possession.
(d) You must validate the harvest tickets, tags, permits, or other required documents before removing your kill from the harvest site. You must also comply with all reporting provisions as set forth in subpart D of this part.
(e) If you take fish and wildlife under a community harvest system, you must report the harvest activity in accordance with regulations specified for that community in subpart D of this part, and as required by any applicable permit conditions. Individuals may be responsible for particular reporting requirements in the conditions permitting a specific community's harvest. Failure to comply with these conditions is a violation of the regulations in this part. Community harvests are reviewed annually under the regulations in subpart D of this part.
(f) You may not make a fraudulent application for Federal or State licenses, permits, harvest tickets or tags or intentionally file an incorrect harvest report.
[67 FR 30563, May 7, 2002, as amended at 68 FR 7704, Feb. 18, 2003]
§ 242.7
Restriction on use.
(a) You may not use fish or wildlife or their parts, taken pursuant to the regulations in this part, unless provided for in this part.
(b) You may not exchange in customary trade or sell fish or wildlife or their parts, taken pursuant to the regulations in this part, unless provided for in this part.
(c) You may barter fish or wildlife or their parts, taken pursuant to the regulations in this part, unless restricted in §§ 242.25, 242.26, 242.27, or 242.28.
§ 242.8
Penalties.
If you are convicted of violating any provision of 50 CFR Part 100 or 36 CFR Part 242, you may be punished by a fine or by imprisonment in accordance with the penalty provisions applicable to the public land where the violation occurred.
§ 242.9
Information collection requirements.
(a) The rules in this part contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. They apply to fish and wildlife harvest activities on public lands in Alaska. Subsistence users will not be required to respond to an information collection request unless a valid
OMB number is displayed on the information collection form.
(1) Section 242.6, Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and reports. The information collection requirements contained in § 242.6 (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Harvester Permit forms) provide for permit-specific subsistence activities not authorized through the general adoption of State regulations. Identity and location of residence are required to determine if you are eligible for a permit and a report of success is required after a harvest attempt. These requirements are not duplicative with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The regulations in § 242.6 require this information before a rural Alaska resident may engage in subsistence uses on public lands. The Department estimates that the average time necessary to obtain and comply with this permit information collection requirement is 0.25 hours.
(2) Section 242.20, Request for reconsideration. The information collection requirements contained in § 242.20 provide a standardized process to allow individuals the opportunity to appeal decisions of the Board. Submission of a request for reconsideration is voluntary but required to receive a final review by the Board. We estimate that a request for reconsideration will take 4 hours to prepare and submit.
(3) The remaining information collection requirements contained in this part imposed upon subsistence users are those adopted from State regulations. These collection requirements would exist in the absence of Federal subsistence regulations and are not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The burden in this situation is negligible, and information gained from these reports is systematically available to Federal managers by routine computer access requiring less than 1 hour.
(b) You may direct comments on the burden estimate or any other aspect of the burden estimate to: Information Collection Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street, N.W., MS 222 ARLSQ, Washington, D.C. 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (Subsistence), Washington, D.C. 20503. Additional information requirements may be imposed if Local Advisory Committees or additional Regional Councils, subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), are established under subpart B of this part. Such requirements will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to their implementation.

§ 242.10
Federal Subsistence Board.
(a)
Authority.
The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture hereby establish a Federal Subsistence Board (Board) and delegate to it the authority for administering the subsistence taking and uses of fish and wildlife on public lands and the related promulgation and signature authority for regulations of subparts C and D of this part. The Secretaries retain their existing authority to restrict or eliminate hunting, fishing, or trapping activities that occur on lands or waters in Alaska other than public lands when such activities interfere with subsistence hunting, fishing, or trapping on the public lands to such an extent as to result in a failure to provide the subsistence priority. The Secretaries also retain the ultimate responsibility for compliance with title VIII of ANILCA and other applicable laws and maintain oversight of the Board.
(b)
Membership.
(1) The voting members of the Board are: A Chair who possesses personal knowledge of and direct experience with subsistence uses in rural Alaska to be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture; five public members who possess personal knowledge of and direct experience with subsistence uses in rural Alaska, three of whom shall be nominated or recommended by federally recognized Tribal governments in Alaska and shall possess personal knowledge of and direct experience with subsistence uses in rural Alaska (including Alaska Native subsistence uses), to be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with the concurrence of
the Secretary of Agriculture; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the Alaska Regional Director, National Park Service; the Alaska Regional Forester, U.S. Forest Service; the Alaska State Director, Bureau of Land Management; and the Alaska Regional Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs.

(v) Ensure that the taking on public lands of fish and wildlife for nonwasteful subsistence uses shall be accorded priority over the taking on such lands of fish and wildlife for other purposes;
(vi) Restrict the taking of fish and wildlife on public lands for nonsubsistence uses or close public lands to the take of fish and wildlife for nonsubsistence uses when necessary for the conservation of healthy populations of fish or wildlife, to continue subsistence uses of fish or wildlife, or for reasons of public safety or administration. The Board may also reopen public lands to nonsubsistence uses if new information or changed conditions indicate that the closure is no longer warranted;
(vii) Restrict the taking of a particular fish or wildlife population on public lands for subsistence uses, close public lands to the take of fish and wildlife for subsistence uses, or otherwise modify the requirements for take from a particular fish or wildlife population on public lands for subsistence uses when necessary to ensure the continued viability of a fish or wildlife population, or for reasons of public safety or administration. As soon as conditions warrant, the Board may also reopen public lands to the taking of a fish and wildlife population for subsistence users to continue those uses;
(viii) Establish priorities for the subsistence taking of fish and wildlife on public lands among rural Alaska residents;
(ix) Restrict or eliminate taking of fish and wildlife on public lands;
(x) Determine what types and forms of trade of fish and wildlife taken for subsistence uses constitute allowable customary trade;
(xi) Authorize the Regional Councils to convene;
(xii) Establish a Regional Council in each subsistence resource region and recommend to the Secretaries, appointees to the Regional Councils, pursuant to the FACA;
(xiii) Establish Federal Advisory Committees within the subsistence resource regions, if necessary, and recommend to the Secretaries that members of the Federal Advisory Committees be appointed from the group of individuals nominated by rural Alaska residents;
(xiv) Establish rules and procedures for the operation of the Board, and the Regional Councils;

(xvii) Develop alternative permitting processes relating to the subsistence taking of fish and wildlife to ensure continued opportunities for subsistence;
(xviii) Evaluate whether hunting, fishing, or trapping activities which occur on lands or waters in Alaska other than public lands interfere with subsistence hunting, fishing, or trapping on the public lands to such an extent as to result in a failure to provide the subsistence priority, and after appropriate consultation with the State of Alaska, the Regional Councils, and other Federal agencies, make a recommendation to the Secretaries for their action;
(xix) Identify, in appropriate specific instances, whether there exists additional Federal reservations, Federal reserved water rights or other Federal interests in lands or waters, including those in which the United States holds less than a fee ownership, to which the Federal subsistence priority attaches, and make appropriate recommendation to the Secretaries for inclusion of those interests within the Federal Subsistence Management Program; and
(xx) Take other actions authorized by the Secretaries to implement Title VIII of ANILCA.
(5) The Board may implement one or more of the following harvest and harvest reporting or permit systems:
(i) The fish and wildlife is taken by an individual who is required to obtain and possess pertinent State harvest permits, tickets, or tags, or Federal permit (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit);
(ii) A qualified subsistence user may designate another qualified subsistence user (by using the Federal Designated Harvester Permit) to take fish and wildlife on his or her behalf;
(iii) The fish and wildlife is taken by individuals or community representatives permitted (via a Federal Subsistence Registration Permit) a one-time or annual harvest for special purposes including ceremonies and potlatches; or
(iv) The fish and wildlife is taken by representatives of a community permitted to do so in a manner consistent with the community's customary and traditional practices.
(6) The Board may delegate to agency field officials the authority to set harvest and possession limits, define harvest areas, specify methods or means of harvest, specify permit requirements, and open or close specific fish or wildlife harvest seasons within frameworks established by the Board.
(7) The Board shall establish a Staff Committee for analytical and administrative assistance composed of members from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and USDA Forest Service. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service representative shall serve as Chair of the Staff Committee.
(8) The Board may establish and dissolve additional committees as necessary for assistance.
(9) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shall provide appropriate administrative support for the Board.
(10) The Board shall authorize at least two meetings per year for each Regional Council.
(11) The Secretary of the Interior, or the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to a unit of the National Forest System, retains authority to (at any time) stay, modify, or disapprove any action taken by the Board.
(12) Special actions of the Board are not effective unless ratified by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to a unit of the National Forest System. To allow an opportunity for the Secretaries to modify, disapprove, stay, or expressly ratify any emergency or temporary special action taken by the Board, such Board actions generally will not become effective until 10 calendar days after the date of the action (or any
longer period specified by the Board when taking the action), unless the Board determines that the situation calls for responsive action within a shorter period of time. If no action is taken by the Secretary to modify, disapprove, stay, or expressly ratify within 10 days (or the longer or shorter period specified by the Board), the emergency or temporary special action will be deemed automatically ratified for purposes of this subpart. The Secretaries may revisit a prior ratification (express or automatic) of a Board action at any time. For other Board actions (
i.e.,
actions that follow the regular adoption process in § 242.18), the Secretaries retain, and will exercise when appropriate, their authority to modify or disapprove actions prior to publication in the
Federal Register,
as is the current practice.
(13) For Board actions such as cyclic regulation revisions, customary and traditional use determinations, subsistence resource regions, rural determinations, and requests for reconsideration, when the Secretaries deem appropriate, they will exercise their authority to modify or disapprove the actions prior to publication of the actions in the
Federal Register.
The Board's special actions, both emergency and temporary, are often based on time-sensitive harvest opportunities for rural Alaskans or critical conservation concerns for a species and are valid upon decision by the Board. However, the Secretaries may at any time rescind, modify, disapprove, or stay a special action by the Board.
(14) The Secretaries may establish term limits for service of Board members in such circumstances as the Secretaries deem appropriate.
(e)
Relationship to Regional Councils.
(1) The Board shall consider the reports and recommendations of the Regional Councils concerning the taking of fish and wildlife on public lands within their respective regions for subsistence uses. The Board may choose not to follow any Regional Council recommendation which it determines is not supported by substantial evidence, violates recognized principles of fish and wildlife conservation, would be detrimental to the satisfaction of subsistence needs, or in closure situations, for reasons of public safety or administration or to assure the continued viability of a particular fish or wildlife population. If a recommendation is not adopted, the Board shall set forth the factual basis and the reasons for the decision, in writing, in a timely fashion.
(2) The Board shall provide available and appropriate technical assistance to the Regional Councils.

community's or area's use of specific fish stocks and wildlife populations. For areas managed by the National Park Service, where subsistence uses are allowed, the determinations may be made on an individual basis.
(b) A community or area shall generally exhibit the following factors, which exemplify customary and traditional use. The Board shall make customary and traditional use determinations based on application of the following factors:
(1) A long-term consistent pattern of use, excluding interruptions beyond the control of the community or area;
(2) A pattern of use recurring in specific seasons for many years;
(3) A pattern of use consisting of methods and means of harvest which are characterized by efficiency and economy of effort and cost, conditioned by local characteristics;
(4) The consistent harvest and use of fish or wildlife as related to past methods and means of taking; near, or reasonably accessible from, the community or area;
(5) A means of handling, preparing, preserving, and storing fish or wildlife which has been traditionally used by past generations, including consideration of alteration of past practices due to recent technological advances, where appropriate;
(6) A pattern of use which includes the handing down of knowledge of fishing and hunting skills, values, and lore from generation to generation;
(7) A pattern of use in which the harvest is shared or distributed within a definable community of persons; and
(8) A pattern of use which relates to reliance upon a wide diversity of fish and wildlife resources of the area and which provides substantial cultural, economic, social, and nutritional elements to the community or area.
(c) The Board shall take into consideration the reports and recommendations of any appropriate Regional Council regarding customary and traditional uses of subsistence resources.
(d) Current determinations are listed in § 242.24.
§ 242.17
Determining priorities for subsistence uses among rural Alaska residents.
(a) Whenever it is necessary to restrict the subsistence taking of fish and wildlife on public lands in order to protect the continued viability of such populations, or to continue subsistence uses, the Board shall establish a priority among the rural Alaska residents after considering any recommendation submitted by an appropriate Regional Council.
(b) The priority shall be implemented through appropriate limitations based on the application of the following criteria to each area, community, or individual determined to have customary and traditional use, as necessary:
(1) Customary and direct dependence upon the populations as the mainstay of livelihood;
(2) Local residency; and
(3) The availability of alternative resources.
(c) If allocation on an area or community basis is not achievable, then the Board shall allocate subsistence opportunity on an individual basis through application of the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
(d) In addressing a situation where prioritized allocation becomes necessary, the Board shall solicit recommendations from the Regional Council in the area affected.
§ 242.18
Regulation adoption process.
(a) The Board will accept proposals for changes to the Federal subsistence regulations in subparts C or D of this part according to a published schedule, except for proposals for emergency and temporary special actions, which the Board will accept according to procedures set forth in § 242.19. The Board may establish a rotating schedule for accepting proposals on various sections of subpart C or subpart D regulations over a period of years. The Board will develop and publish proposed regulations in the
Federal Register,
publish notice in local newspapers, and distribute comments on the proposed regulations in the form of proposals for public review.
(1) Proposals shall be made available for at least a thirty (30) day review by
the Regional Councils. Regional Councils shall forward their recommendations on proposals to the Board. Such proposals with recommendations may be submitted in the time period as specified by the Board or as a part of the Regional Council's annual report described in § 242.11, whichever is earlier.
(2) The Board shall publish notice throughout Alaska of the availability of proposals received.
(3) The public shall have at least thirty (30) days to review and comment on proposals.
(4) After the comment period the Board shall meet to receive public testimony and consider the proposals. The Board shall consider traditional use patterns when establishing harvest levels and seasons, and methods and means. The Board may choose not to follow any recommendation which the Board determines is not supported by substantial evidence, violates recognized principles of fish and wildlife conservation, or would be detrimental to the satisfaction of subsistence needs. If a recommendation approved by a Regional Council is not adopted by the Board, the Board shall set forth the factual basis and the reasons for its decision in writing to the Regional Council.
(5) Following consideration of the proposals the Board shall publish final regulations pertaining to subparts C and D of this part in the
Federal Register.
(b) Proposals for changes to subparts A and B of this part shall be accepted by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with 43 CFR part 14.

§ 242.19
Special actions.
(a)
Emergency special actions.
In an emergency situation, if necessary to ensure the continued viability of a fish or wildlife population, to continue subsistence uses of fish or wildlife, or for public safety reasons, the Board may immediately open or close public lands for the taking of fish and wildlife for subsistence uses, or modify the requirements for take for subsistence uses, or close public lands to take for nonsubsistence uses of fish and wildlife, or restrict the requirements for take for nonsubsistence uses.
(1) If the timing of a regularly scheduled meeting of the affected Regional Council so permits without incurring undue delay, the Board may seek Council recommendations on the proposed emergency special action. Such a Council recommendation, if any, will be subject to the requirements of § 242.18(a)(4).
(2) The emergency action will be effective when directed by the Board, may not exceed 60 days, and may not be extended unless the procedures for adoption of a temporary special action, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, have been followed.
(b)
Temporary special actions.
After adequate notice and public hearing, the Board may temporarily close or open public lands for the taking of fish and wildlife for subsistence uses, or modify the requirements for subsistence take, or close public lands for the taking of fish and wildlife for nonsubsistence uses, or restrict take for nonsubsistence uses.
(1) The Board may make such temporary changes only after it determines that the proposed temporary change will not interfere with the conservation of healthy fish and wildlife populations, will not be detrimental to the long-term subsistence use of fish or wildlife resources, and is not an unnecessary restriction on nonsubsistence users. The Board may also reopen public lands to nonsubsistence uses if new information or changed conditions indicate that the closure is no longer warranted.
(i) Prior to implementing a temporary special action, the Board will consult with the State of Alaska and the Chairs of the Regional Councils of the affected regions.
(ii) If the timing of a regularly scheduled meeting of the affected Regional Council so permits without incurring undue delay, the Board will seek Council recommendations on the proposed temporary special action. Such Council recommendations, if any, will be subject to the requirements of § 242.18(a)(4).
(2) The length of any temporary action will be confined to the minimum
time period or harvest limit determined by the Board to be necessary under the circumstances. In any event, a temporary opening or closure will not extend longer than the end of the current regulatory cycle.
(c) The Board may reject a request for either an emergency or a temporary special action if the Board concludes that there are no time-sensitive circumstances necessitating a regulatory change before the next regular proposal cycle. However, a special action request that has been rejected for this reason may be deferred, if appropriate and after consultation with the proponent, for consideration during the next regular proposal cycle. The Board will consider changes to customary and traditional use determinations in subpart C of this part only during the regular proposal cycle.
(d) The Board will provide notice of all regulatory changes adopted via special action by posting the change on the Office of Subsistence Management Web site (
http://alaska.fws.gov/asm/index.cfml
). When appropriate, notice may also include distribution of press releases to newspapers, local radio stations, and local contacts, as well as direct notification to the proponent and interested parties. The Board will publish notice and reasons justifying the special action in the
Federal Register
as soon as practicable.
(e) The decision of the Board on any proposed special action will constitute its final administrative action.
(f) Regulations authorizing any individual agency to implement closures or restrictions on public lands managed by the agency remain unaffected by the regulations in this part.
(g) Fish and wildlife may not be taken in violation of any restriction, closure, or change authorized by the Board.

§ 242.20
Request for reconsideration.
(a) Regulations in subparts C and D of this part published in the
Federal Register
are subject to requests for reconsideration.
(b) Any aggrieved person may file a request for reconsideration with the Board.
(c) To file a request for reconsideration, you must notify the Board in writing within sixty (60) days of the effective date or date of publication of the notice, whichever is earlier, for which reconsideration is requested.
(d) It is your responsibility to provide the Board with sufficient narrative evidence and argument to show why the action by the Board should be reconsidered. The Board will accept a request for reconsideration only if it is based upon information not previously considered by the Board, demonstrates that the existing information used by the Board is incorrect, or demonstrates that the Board's interpretation of information, applicable law, or regulation is in error or contrary to existing law. You must include the following information in your request for reconsideration:
(1) Your name, and mailing address;
(2) The action which you request be reconsidered and the date of
Federal Register
publication of that action;
(3) A detailed statement of how you are adversely affected by the action;
(4) A detailed statement of the facts of the dispute, the issues raised by the request, and specific references to any law, regulation, or policy that you believe to be violated and your reason for such allegation;
(5) A statement of how you would like the action changed.
(e) Upon receipt of a request for reconsideration, the Board shall transmit a copy of such request to any appropriate Regional Council and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) for review and recommendation. The Board shall consider any Regional Council and ADFG recommendations in making a final decision.
(f) If the request is justified, the Board shall implement a final decision on a request for reconsideration after compliance with 5 U.S.C. 551-559 (APA).
(g) If the request is denied, the decision of the Board represents the final administrative action.
