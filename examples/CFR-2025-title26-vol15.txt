# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 1.1551-1
Disallowance of surtax exemption and accumulated earnings credit.
(a)
In general.
If:
(1) Any corporation transfers, on or after January 1, 1951, and before June 13, 1963, all or part of its property (other than money) to a transferee corporation,
(2) Any corporation transfers, directly or indirectly, after June 12, 1963, all or part of its property (other than money) to a transferee corporation, or
(3) Five or fewer individuals are in control of a corporation and one or more of them transfer, directly or indirectly, after June 12, 1963, property (other than money) to a transferee corporation, and the transferee was created for the purpose of acquiring such property or was not actively engaged in business at the time of such acquisition, and if after such transfer the transferor or transferors are in control of the transferee during any part of the taxable year of the transferee, then for
such taxable year of the transferee the Secretary or his delegate may disallow the surtax exemption defined in section 11(d) or the accumulated earnings credit of $150,000 ($100,000 in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1975) provided in paragraph (2) or (3) of section 535(c), unless the transferee establishes by the clear preponderance of the evidence that the securing of such exemption or credit was not a major purpose of the transfer.
(b)
Purpose of section 1551.
The purpose of section 1551 is to prevent avoidance or evasion of the surtax imposed by section 11(c) or of the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531. It is not intended, however, that section 1551 be interpreted as delimiting or abrogating any principle of law established by judicial decision, or any existing provisions of the Code, such as sections 269 and 482, which have the effect of preventing the avoidance or evasion of income taxes. Such principles of law and such provisions of the Code, including section 1551, are not mutually exclusive, and in appropriate cases they may operate together or they may operate separately.
(c)
Application of section 269(b) to cases covered by section 1551.
The provisions of section 269(b) and the authority of the district director thereunder, to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of section 1551, are applicable to cases covered by section 1551. Pursuant to the authority provided in section 269(b) the district director may allow to the transferee any part of a surtax exemption or accumulated earnings credit for a taxable year for which such exemption or credit would otherwise be disallowed under section 1551(a); or he may apportion such exemption or credit among the corporations involved. For example, corporation A transfers on January 1, 1955, all of its property to corporations B and C in exchange for all of the stock of such corporations. Immediately thereafter, corporation A is dissolved and its stockholders become the sole stockholders of corporations B and C. Assuming that corporations B and C are unable to establish by the clear preponderance of the evidence that the securing of the surtax exemption defined in section 11(d) or the accumulated earnings credit provided in section 535, or both, was not a major purpose of the transfer, the district director is authorized under sections 1551(c) and 269(b) to allow one such exemption and credit and to apportion such exemption and credit between corporations B and C.
(d)
Actively engaged in business.
For purposes of this section, a corporation maintaining an office for the purpose of preserving its corporate existence is not considered to be “actively engaged in business” even though such corporation may be deemed to be “doing business” for other purposes. Similarly, for purposes of this section, a corporation engaged in winding up its affairs, prior to an acquisition to which section 1551 is applicable, is not considered to be “actively engaged in business.”
(e)
Meaning and application of the term “control”
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term “control” means:
(i) With respect to a transferee corporation described in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, the ownership by the transferor corporation, its shareholders, or both, of stock possessing either (
a
) at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or (
b
) at least 80 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock.
(ii) With respect to each corporation described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the ownership by five or fewer individuals of stock possessing (
a
) at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 80 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of the stock of each corporation, and (
b
) more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or more than 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership of each such individual only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation.
(2)
Special rules.
In determining for purposes of this section whether stock possessing at least 80 percent (or more than 50 percent in the case of subparagraph (1)(ii)(
b
) of this paragraph) of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock entitled to vote is owned, all classes of such stock shall be considered together; it is not necessary that at least 80 percent (or more than 50 percent) of each class of voting stock be owned. Likewise, in determining for purposes of this section whether stock possessing at least 80 percent (or more than 50 percent) of the total value of shares of all classes of stock is owned, all classes of stock of the corporation shall be considered together; it is not necessary that at least 80 percent (or more than 50 percent) of the value of shares of each class be owned. The fair market value of a share shall be considered as the value to be used for purposes of this computation. With respect to transfers described in paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section, the ownership of stock shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1563(e) and the regulations thereunder. With respect to transfers described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the ownership of stock shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 544 and the regulations thereunder, except that constructive ownership under section 544(a)(2) shall be determined only with respect to the individual's spouse and minor children. In determining control, no stock shall be excluded because such stock was acquired before January 1, 1951 (the effective date of section 1551(a)(1)), or June 13, 1963 (the effective date of section 1551(a) (2) and (3)).
(3)
Example.
This paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On January 1, 1964, individual A, who owns 50 percent of the voting stock of corporation X, and individual B, who owns 30 percent of such voting stock, transfer property (other than money) to corporation Y (newly created for the purpose of acquiring such property) in exchange for all of Y's voting stock. After the transfer, A and B own the voting stock of corporations X and Y in the following proportions:
Individual
Corp. X
Corp. Y
Identical ownership
A
50
30
30
B
30
50
30
Total
80
80
60
The transfer of property by A and B to corporation Y is a transfer described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section since (i) A and B own at least 80 percent of the voting stock of corporations X and Y, and (ii) taking into account each such individual's stock ownership only to the extent such ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation, A and B own more than 50 percent of the voting stock of corporations X and Y.
(f)
Taxable year of allowance or disallowance
—(1)
In general.
The district director's authority with respect to cases covered by section 1551 is not limited to the taxable year of the transferee corporation in which the transfer of property occurs. Such authority extends to the taxable year in which the transfer occurs or any subsequent taxable year of the transferee corporation if, during any part of such year, the transferor or transferors are in control of the transferee.
(2)
Examples.
This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On January 1, 1955, corporation D transfers property (other than money) to corporation E, a corporation not actively engaged in business at the time of the acquisition of such property, in exchange for 60 percent of the voting stock of E. During a later taxable year of E, corporation D acquires an additional 20 percent of such voting stock. As a result of such additional acquisition, D owns 80 percent of the voting stock of E. Accordingly, section 1551(a)(1) is applicable for the taxable year in which the later acquisition of stock occurred and for each taxable year thereafter in which the requisite control continues.

# Example 2.
On June 20, 1963, individual A, who owns all of the stock of corporation X, transfers property (other than money) to corporation Y, a corporation not actively engaged in business at the time of the acquisition of such property, in exchange for 60 percent of the voting stock of Y. During a later taxable year of Y, A acquires an additional 20 percent of such voting stock. After such acquisition A owns at least 80 percent of the voting stock of corporations X and Y. Accordingly, section 1551(a)(3) is applicable for the taxable year in which the later acquisition of stock occurred and for each taxable year thereafter in which the requisite control continues.

# Example 3.
Individuals A and B each owns 50 percent of the stock of corporation X. On January 15, 1964, A transfers property (other than money) to corporation Y (newly created by A for the purpose of acquiring such property) in exchange for all the stock of Y. In a subsequent taxable year of Y, individual B buys 50 percent of the stock which A owns in Y (or he transfers money to Y in exchange for its stock, as a result of which he owns 50
percent of Y's stock). Immediately thereafter the stock ownership of A and B in corporation Y is identical to their stock ownership in corporation X. Accordingly, section 1551(a)(3) is applicable for the taxable year in which B acquires stock in corporation Y (see paragraph (g)(3) of this section) and for each taxable year thereafter in which the requisite control continues. Moreover, if B's acquisition of stock in Y is pursuant to a preexisting agreement with A, A's transfer to Y and B's acquisition of Y's stock are considered a single transaction and section 1551(a)(3) also would be applicable for the taxable year in which A's transfer to Y took place and for each taxable year thereafter in which the requisite control continues.
(g)
Nature of transfer
—(1)
Corporate transfers before June 13, 1963.
A transfer made before June 13, 1963, by any corporation of all or part of its assets, whether or not such transfer qualifies as a reorganization under section 368, is within the scope of section 1551(a)(1), except that section 1551(a)(1) does not apply to a transfer of money only. For example, the transfer of cash for the purpose of expanding the business of the transferor corporation through the formation of a new corporation is not a transfer within the scope of section 1551(a)(1), irrespective of whether the new corporation uses the cash to purchase from the transferor corporation stock in trade or similar property.
(2)
Corporate transfers after June 12, 1963.
A direct or indirect transfer made after June 12, 1963, by any corporation of all or part of its assets to a transferee corporation, whether or not such transfer qualifies as a reorganization under section 368, is within the scope of section 1551(a)(2) except that section 1551(a)(2) does not apply to a transfer of money only. For example, if a transferor corporation transfers property to its shareholders or to a subsidiary, the transfer of that property by the shareholders or the subsidiary to a transferee corporation as part of the same transaction is a transfer of property by the transferor corporation to which section 1551(a)(2) applies. A transfer of property pursuant to a purchase by a transferee corporation from a transferor corporation controlling the transferee is within the scope of section 1551(a)(2), whether or not the purchase follows a transfer of cash from the controlling corporation.
(3)
Other transfers after June 12, 1963.
A direct or indirect transfer made after June 12, 1963, by five or fewer individuals to a transferee corporation, whether or not such transfer qualifies under one or more other provisions of the Code (for example, section 351), is within the scope of section 1551(a)(3) except that section 1551(a)(3) does not apply to a transfer of money only. Thus, if one of five or fewer individuals who are in control of a corporation transfers property (other than money) to a controlled transferee corporation, the transfer is within the scope of section 1551(a)(3) notwithstanding that the other individuals transfer nothing or transfer only money.
(4)
Examples.
This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Individuals A and B each owns 50 percent of the voting stock of corporation X. On January 15, 1964, A and B each acquires property (other than money) from X and, as part of the same transaction, each transfers such property to his wholly owned corporation (newly created for the purpose of acquiring such property). A and B retain substantial continuing interests in corporation X. The transfers to the two newly created corporations are within the scope of section 1551(a)(2).

# Example 2.
Corporation W organizes corporation X, a wholly owned subsidiary, for the purpose of acquiring the properties of corporation Y. Pursuant to a reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(C), substantially all of the properties of corporation Y are transferred on June 15, 1963, to corporation X solely in exchange for voting stock of corporation W. There is a transfer of property from W to X within the meaning of section 1551(a)(2).

# Example 3.
Individuals A and B, each owning 50 percent of the voting stock of corporation X, organize corporation Y to which each transfers money only in exchange for 50 percent of the stock of Y. Subsequently, Y uses such money to acquire other property from A and B after June 12, 1963. Such acquisition is within the scope of section 1551(a)(3).

# Example 4.
Individual A owns 55 percent of the stock of corporation X. Another 25 percent of corporation X's stock is owned in the aggregate by individuals B, C, D, and E. On June 15, 1963, individual A transfers property to corporation Y (newly created for the purpose of acquiring such property) in exchange for 60 percent of the stock of Y, and B, C, and D acquire all of the remaining stock of Y. The transfer is within the scope of section 1551(a)(3).
(h)
Purpose of transfer.
In determining, for purposes of this section, whether the securing of the surtax exemption or accumulated earnings credit constituted “a major purpose” of the transfer, all circumstances relevant to the transfer shall be considered. “A major purpose” will not be inferred from the mere purchase of inventory by a subsidiary from a centralized warehouse maintained by its parent corporation or by another subsidiary of the parent corporation. For disallowance of the surtax exemption and accumulated earnings credit under section 1551, it is not necessary that the obtaining of either such credit or exemption, or both, have been the sole or principal purpose of the transfer of the property. It is sufficient if it appears, in the light of all the facts and circumstances, that the obtaining of such exemption or credit, or both, was one of the major considerations that prompted the transfer. Thus, the securing of the surtax exemption or the accumulated earnings credit may constitute “a major purpose” of the transfer, notwithstanding that such transfer was effected for a valid business purpose and qualified as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368. The taxpayer's burden of establishing by the clear preponderance of the evidence that the securing of either such exemption or credit or both was not “a major purpose” of the transfer may be met, for example, by showing that the obtaining of such exemption, or credit, or both, was not a major factor in relationship to the other consideration or considerations which prompted the transfer.
[T.D. 6911, 32 FR 3214, Feb. 24, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7376, 40 FR 42745, Sept. 16, 1975]
§ 1.1552-1
Earnings and profits.
(a)
General rule.
For the purpose of determining the earnings and profits of each member of an affiliated group which is required to be included in a consolidated return for such group filed for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, the tax liability of the group shall be allocated among the members of the group in accordance with one of the following methods, pursuant to an election under paragraph (c) of this section:
(1)(i) The tax liability of the group shall be apportioned among the members of the group in accordance with the ratio which that portion of the consolidated taxable income attributable to each member of the group having taxable income bears to the consolidated taxable income.
(ii) For consolidated return years beginning after December 31, 1965, a member's portion of the tax liability of the group under the method of allocation provided by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is an amount equal to the tax liability of the group multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the taxable income of such member, and the denominator of which is the sum of the taxable incomes of all the members. For purposes of this subdivision the taxable income of a member shall be the separate taxable income determined under § 1.1502-12, adjusted for the following items taken into account in the computation of consolidated taxable income:
(A) The portion of the consolidated net operating loss deduction, the consolidated charitable contributions deduction, the consolidated dividends received deduction, the consolidated section 247 deduction, the consolidated section 582(c) net loss, and the consolidated section 922 deduction, attributable to such member;
(B) Such member's capital gain net income (determined without regard to any net capital loss carryover attributable to such member);
(C) Such member's net capital loss and section 1231 net loss, reduced by the portion of the consolidated net capital loss attributable to such member; and
(D) The portion of any consolidated net capital loss carryover attributable to such member which is absorbed in the taxable year.
If the computation of the taxable income of a member under this subdivision results in an excess of deductions over gross income, then for purposes of this subdivision such member's taxable income shall be zero.
(2)(i) The tax liability of the group shall be allocated to the several members of the group on the basis of the
percentage of the total tax which the tax of such member if computed on a separate return would bear to the total amount of the taxes for all members of the group so computed.
(ii) For consolidated return years beginning after December 31, 1965, a member's portion of the tax liability of the group under the method of allocation provided by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is an amount equal to the tax liability of the group multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the separate return tax liability of such member, and the denominator of which is the sum of the separate return tax liabilities of all the members. For purposes of this subdivision the separate return tax liability of a member is its tax liability computed as if it has filed a separate return for the year except that:
(A) Gains and losses on intercompany transactions shall be taken into account as provided in § 1.1502-13 as if a consolidated return had been filed for the year;
(B) [Reserved]
(C) Transactions with respect to stock, bonds, or other obligations of members shall be reflected as provided in § 1.1502-13 (f) and (g) as if a consolidated return had been filed for the year;
(D) Excess losses shall be included in income as provided in § 1.1502-19 as if a consolidated return had been filed for the year;
(E) In the computation of the deduction under section 167, property shall not lose its character as new property as a result of a transfer from one member to another member during the year;
(F) A dividend distributed by one member to another member during the year shall not be taken into account in computing the deductions under section 243(a)(1), 244(a), 245, or 247 (relating to deductions with respect to dividends received and dividends paid);
(G) Basis shall be determined under §§ 1.1502-31 and 1.1502-32, and earnings and profits shall be determined under § 1.1502-33, as if a consolidated return had been filed for the year;
(H) Subparagraph (2) of § 1.1502-3(f) shall apply as if a consolidated return had been filed for the year; and
(I) For purposes of subtitle A of the Code, if two or more taxable income brackets are set forth in section 11(b) of the Code, the amount in each taxable income bracket is divided by the number of members (or such portion of each bracket which is apportioned to the member pursuant to a schedule attached to the consolidated return for the consolidated return year). However, if for the taxable year some or all of the members are component members of a controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563) and if there are other such component members which do not join in filing the consolidated return for such year, the amount to be divided among the members filing the consolidated return is (in lieu of the taxable income brackets) the sum of the amounts apportioned to the component members which join in filing the consolidated return.
(3)(i) The tax liability of the group (excluding the tax increases arising from the consolidation) shall be allocated on the basis of the contribution of each member of the group to the consolidated taxable income of the group. Any tax increases arising from the consolidation shall be distributed to the several members in direct proportion to the reduction in tax liability resulting to such members from the filing of the consolidated return as measured by the difference between their tax liabilities determined on a separate return basis and their tax liabilities (determined without regard to the 2-percent increase provided by section 1503(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.1502-30A (as contained in the 26 CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1996) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964) based on their contributions to the consolidated taxable income.
(ii) For consolidated return years beginning after December 31, 1965, a member's portion of the tax liability of the group under the method of allocation provided by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be determined by:
(
a
) Allocating the tax liability of the group in accordance with subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, but
(
b
) The amount of tax liability allocated to any member shall not exceed the separate return tax liability of
such member, determined in accordance with subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, and
(
c
) The sum of the amounts which would be allocated to the members but for (
b
) of this subdivision (ii) shall be apportioned among the other members in direct proportion to, but limited to, the reduction in tax liability resulting to such other members. Such reduction for any member shall be the excess, if any, of (
1
) its separate this paragraph.
(4) The tax liability of the group shall be allocated in accordance with any other method selected by the group with the approval of the Commissioner. No method of allocation may be approved under this subparagraph which may result in the allocation of a positive tax liability for a taxable year, among the members who are allocated a positive tax liability for such year, in a total amount which is more or less than the tax liability of the group for such year. (However, see paragraph (d) of § 1.1502-33.)
(b)
Application of rules
—(1)
Tax liability of the group.
For purposes of section 1552 and this section, the tax liability of the group for a taxable year shall consist of the Federal income tax liability of the group for such year determined in accordance with § 1.1502-2 or § 1.1502-30A (as contained in the 26 CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1996), which-ever is applicable. Thus, in the case of a carryback of a loss or credit to such year, although the earnings and profits of the members of the group may not be adjusted until the subsequent taxable year from which the loss or credit was carried back, the effect of the carryback, for purposes of this section, shall be determined by allocating the amount of the adjustment as a part of the tax liability of the group for the taxable year to which the loss or credit is carried. For example, if a consolidated net operating loss is carried back from 1969 to 1967, the allocation of the tax liability of the group for 1967 shall be recomputed in accordance with the method of allocation used for 1967, and the changes resulting from such recomputation shall, for accrual method taxpayers, be reflected in the earnings and profits of the appropriate members in 1969.
(2)
Effect of allocation.
The amount of tax liability allocated to a corporation as its share of the tax liability of the group, pursuant to this section, shall (i) result in a decrease in the earnings and profits of such corporation in such amount, and (ii) be treated as a liability of such corporation for such amount. If the full amount of such liability is not paid by such corporation, pursuant to an agreement among the members of the group or otherwise, the amount which is not paid will generally be treated as a distribution with respect to stock, a contribution to capital, or a combination thereof, as the case may be.
(c)
Method of election.
(1) The election under paragraph (a) (1), (2), or (3) of this section shall be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the first consolidated return of the group for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954 (including extensions thereof). If the group elects to allocate its tax liability in accordance with the method prescribed in paragraph (a) (1), (2), or (3) of this section, a statement shall be attached to the return stating which method is elected. Such statement shall be made by the common parent corporation and shall be binding upon all members of the group. In the event that the group desires to allocate its tax liability in accordance with any other method pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, approval of such method by the Commissioner must be obtained within the time prescribed above. If such approval is not obtained in such time, the group shall allocate in accordance with the method prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The request shall state fully the method which the group wishes to apply in apportioning the tax liability. Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, an election once made shall be irrevocable and shall be binding upon the group with respect to the year for which made and for all future years for which a consolidated return is filed or required to be filed unless the Commissioner authorizes a change to another method prior to the time prescribed by law for filing the return for the year in which such change is to be effective.
(2) Each group may make a new election to use any one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (a) (1), (2), or (3) of this section for its first consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 1965, or in conjunction with an election under paragraph (d) of § 1.1502-33, or may request the Commissioner's approval of a method under paragraph (a)(4) of this section for its first consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 1965, irrespective of its previous method of allocation under this section. If such new election is not made in conjunction with an election under paragraph (d) of § 1.1502-33, it shall be effective for the first consolidated return year beginning after December 31, 1965, and all succeeding years. (See § 1.1502-33 for the method of making such new election in conjunction with an election under paragraph (d) of § 1.1502-33.) Any other such new election (or request for the Commissioner's approval of a method under paragraph (a)(4) of this section) shall be made within the time prescribed by law for filing the consolidated return for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1965 (including extensions thereof), or within 60 days after July 3, 1968, whichever is later. Such new election shall be made by attaching a statement to the consolidated return for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1965, or if such election is made within the time prescribed above but after such return is filed, by filing a statement with the internal revenue officer with whom such return was filed.
(d)
Failure to elect.
If a group fails to make an election in its first consolidated return, or any other election, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the method prescribed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be applicable and shall be binding upon the group in the same manner as if an election had been made to so allocate.
(e)
Definitions.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the terms used in this section shall have the same meaning as provided in the regulations under section 1502.
(f)
Example.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Corporation P is the common parent owning all of the stock of corporations S1 and S2, members of an affiliated group. A consolidated return is filed for the taxable year ending December 31, 1966, by P, S1, and S2. For 1966 such corporations had the following taxable incomes or losses computed in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section:
P
0
S1
$2,000
S2
(1,000)
The group has not made an election under paragraph (c) of this section or paragraph (d) of § 1.1502-33. Accordingly, the method of allocation provided by paragraph (a)(1) of this section is in effect for the group. Assuming that the consolidated taxable income is equal to the sum of the members taxable income and losses, or $1,000, the tax liability of the group for the year (assuming a 22-percent rate) is $220, all of which is allocated to S1. S1 accordingly reduces its earnings and profits in the amount of $220, irrespective of who actually pays the tax liability. If S1 pays the $220 tax liability there will be no further effect upon the income, earnings and profits, or the basis of stock of any member. If, however, P pays the $220 tax liability (and such payment is not in fact a loan from P to S1), then P shall be treated as having made a contribution to the capital of S1 in the amount of $220. On the other hand, if S2 pays the $220 tax liability (and such payment is not in fact a loan from S2), then S2 shall be treated as having made a distribution with respect to its stock to P in the amount of $220, and P shall be treated as having made a contribution to the capital of S1 in the amount of $220.

§ 1.1561-1
General rules regarding certain tax benefits available to the component members of a controlled group of corporations.
(a)
In general
—(1)—
Limitation.
Part II (section 1561 and following) of subchapter B of chapter 6 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) (part II) provides rules to limit the amounts of certain specified tax benefit items of component members of a controlled group of corporations for their tax years which include a particular December 31st date, or, in the case of a short taxable year member (see section 1561(b) and § 1.1561-2(e)), the date substituted for that December 31st date. The amount of the tax items enumerated in section 1561(a) available to any of the component members of a controlled group shall be determined for purposes of subtitle A of the Code as if the component members were a single corporation. Certain other tax items also set forth in section 1561(a) (for example, the additional tax imposed by section 11(b)(1) and the section 55(d)(3) phase out of the alternative minimum tax exemption amount) will be determined by combining the positive taxable income or positive alternative minimum taxable income of the component members of such a group and then allocating the amount of such items among those members.
(2)
Definitions.
For certain definitions (including the definition of a
controlled group of corporations
and a
component member
) and special rules for purposes of this part II see section 1563.
(b)
Special rules
—(1)
S Corporation.
For purposes of this part II, the term
corporation
includes a small business corporation (as defined in section 1361). However, for the treatment of such a corporation as an
excluded member
of a controlled group of corporations see § 1.1563-1(b)(2)(ii)(C).
(2)
52-53-week taxable year.
In the case of corporations electing a 52-53-week taxable year under section 441(f)(1), the provisions of this part II shall be applied in accordance with the special rule of section 441(f)(2)(A). See § 1.441-2.
(c)
Tax avoidance.
The provisions of this part II do not delimit or abrogate any principle of law established by judicial decision, or any existing provisions of the Code, such as sections 269, 482, and 1551, which serve to prevent any avoidance or evasion of income taxes.
(d)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to any tax year beginning on or after December 21, 2009. However, taxpayers may apply this section to any Federal income tax return filed on or after December 21, 2009. For tax years beginning before December 21, 2009, see § 1.1561-1T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2009.
[T.D. 9476, 74 FR 68532, Dec. 28, 2009]
§ 1.1561-2
Special rules for allocating reductions of certain section 1561(a) tax-benefit items.
(a)
Additional tax
—(1)
Calculation
—(i)
In general.
For the purpose of determining the amount, if any, of the additional tax imposed by section 11(b)(1) (the additional tax), the taxable incomes of all of the component members of a controlled group of corporations shall be combined to determine whether either of the income thresholds for imposing the additional tax have been attained.
(ii)
Special rules.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section—
(A)
Component member
means a corporation that is apportioned some part of any applicable tax bracket amount; and
(B)
Taxable income
means the positive taxable income of a component member for its entire tax year (even if it was not a member of the group for each day of that tax year) that includes the same December 31st testing date, which is also applicable to the other component members of that same controlled group.
(2)
Apportionment
—(i)
General rule.
Any additional tax determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be apportioned among such members in the same manner as the corresponding tax bracket of section 11(b)(1) is apportioned. For rules to apportion the section 11(b)(1) tax brackets among the component members of a controlled group, see § 1.1561-3(b) or (c).
(ii)
Apportionment methods.
Unless the component members of a controlled group elect to use the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, such members are required to apportion the amount of the additional tax using the proportionate method described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. These component members may elect the FIFO method by specifically adopting such method in their apportionment plan.
(A)
Proportionate method.
Under the proportionate method, the additional tax is allocated to each component member in the same proportion as the portion of the tax-benefit amount that inured to a member from utilizing lower tax brackets bears to the amount of the group's total tax-benefit amount inuring to it from utilizing those lower tax brackets. The tax-benefit amount that inures to a corporation from using a particular tax bracket is the tax savings that such corporation realizes from having a portion of its taxable income taxed at the lower rate attributed to that tax bracket instead of the high tax rates to which it would otherwise be subject. The steps for applying the proportionate method of allocation are as follows:
(
1
)
Step 1.
The regular tax (not including the additional tax) owed by a component member under a particular tax bracket is divided by the total tax owed by all component members under that tax bracket;
(
2
)
Step 2.
The percentage calculated under
Step 1
is multiplied by the total tax-benefit amount inuring to all the members of the group from their use of this tax bracket. This computed amount equals the portion of the group's tax-benefit amount that inured to such member from using its portion of this tax bracket;
(
3
)
Step 3.
The amount determined under
Step 2
is divided by the total tax-benefit amount, inuring to all the component members of the group from using all the tax brackets to which any component member's income was subject;
(
4
)
Step 4.
The percentage calculated under
Step 3
is multiplied by the amount of the group's additional tax. The amount determined under this
Step 4
equals the amount of the additional tax apportioned to such member for that tax bracket; and
(
5
)
Step 5.
If a component member is liable for regular tax (not including the additional tax) under more than one tax bracket, that member must calculate the amount of the additional tax apportioned to it with respect to each tax bracket. Accordingly, steps 1 through 4 must be applied for each tax bracket applicable to that member. The sum of all the apportioned amounts of additional tax from each tax bracket for which the member is subject is the total amount of the additional tax apportioned to that member.
(B)
FIFO method.
Under the FIFO method, the first dollars of the additional tax are to be allocated proportionately to the members starting with the lowest tax bracket (that is, the first tax bracket), up to the amount of the tax benefit inuring to those members from using that tax bracket. Any remaining amount of additional tax is then allocated proportionately among the component members who use the next higher tax bracket, and so on, until the entire amount of the additional tax has been fully apportioned among the members. For example, the first $9,500 of the additional tax liability of a controlled group is apportioned entirely to the member(s) that availed themselves of the benefit of the 15 percent tax bracket.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (a) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
A controlled group of corporations consists of three members: X, Y and Z. X owns all the stock of Y and Z. Each corporation files its separate return on a calendar year basis. For calendar year 2007, the component members of the controlled group have an apportionment plan in effect. The members apportioned 80% of the 15 percent tax-bracket amount ($40,000) to X and the remaining 10% ($10,000) to Y. The members apportioned 100% of the 25 percent tax-bracket amount ($25,000) to Y. However, these members have not adopted the FIFO method for apportioning the additional taxes. Therefore, they must follow the proportionate method. For 2007, X had taxable income (TI) of $40,000, Y had TI of $60,000 and Z had TI of $100,000. Thus the total TI of the group is $200,000.
(ii)
Calculating the tax from the tax brackets and the tax benefit derived from such tax.
(A)
Regular tax of group subject to a 15 percent tax rate.
(
1
)
Calculating the group's tax which resulted from applying a 15 percent tax rate.
The amount of tax under the 15 percent tax bracket is $7,500 (15% × $50,000).
(
2
)
The tax-benefit amount inuring to the group from using the 15 percent tax bracket.
A tax benefit inures to those members of the group who avail themselves of the 15 percent tax bracket. That tax benefit results from having the first $50,000 of its income taxed at the 15 percent tax rate, instead of at the 34 percent tax rate. Thus, the tax-benefit amount inuring to this group from using the 15 percent tax bracket is $9,500 ($17,000 (34% × $50,000) minus $7,500 (15% × $50,000)).
(B)
Regular tax of group subject to a 25 percent tax rate.
(
1
)
Calculating the group's tax which resulted from applying a 25 percent tax rate.
The amount of tax under the 25 percent tax bracket is $6,250 (25% × $25,000 ($75,000−$50,000)).
(
2
)
The tax-benefit amount inuring to the group from using the 25 percent tax bracket.
A tax benefit inures to those members of the group who avail themselves of the 25 percent tax bracket. That tax benefit results from having $25,000 of its income taxed at the 25 percent tax rate, instead of at the 34 percent tax rate. Thus, the tax-benefit amount inuring to this group from using the 25 percent tax bracket is $2,250 ($8,500 (34% × $25,000) minus $6,250 (25% × $25,000)).
(C)
Regular tax of group subject to a 34 percent tax rate.
(
1
)
Calculating the group's tax which resulted from applying a 34 percent tax rate.
The amount of tax under the 34 percent tax bracket is $42,500 (34% × $125,000 ($200,000 (total TI)−$75,000) (amount taxed at lower rates)).
(
2
)
The tax-benefit amount inuring to the group from using the 34 percent tax bracket.
The group's total TI of $200,000 is less than the $15,000,000 income threshold for imposing any 3 percent additional tax on the group. Therefore, there is no tax benefit inuring to the members of this group for using the 34 percent tax bracket.
(D)
The computation of the additional tax.
Since the combined TI of the group exceeds $100,000, a 5 percent additional tax is imposed on the group. That 5 percent additional tax is the lesser amount of 5 percent of the group's taxable income exceeding $100,000 or $11,750. Five percent of that excess amount of taxable income is $5,000 (5% × $100,000 ($200,000−$100,000)). Since $5,000 is less than $11,750, the group's 5 percent additional tax is $5,000.
(iii)
Apportioning the amount of additional tax to each applicable tax bracket.
(A)
The apportioned tax under each bracket.
The amount of tax owed by each member under each tax bracket pursuant to the apportionment plan is as follows:
Name of component member
Amount of tax owed under the 15% tax bracket
Amount of tax owed under the 25% tax bracket
Amount of tax owed under the 34% tax bracket
X
$6,000
0
0
Y
1,500
$6,250
$8,500
Z
0
0
34,000
(B)
Apportioning the 5 percent additional tax among the component members of the controlled group.
Since the group did not elect to adopt the FIFO method of apportionment, it is required to apportion the $5,000 of its 5 percent additional tax pursuant to the proportionate method in the following manner:
(
1
)
Amount of the additional tax apportioned to X.
Pursuant to the plan, X was liable for $6,000 of the group's $7,500 regular tax (80%) owed under the 15 percent tax bracket (and X is not liable for any regular tax under any
higher tax bracket). See
Step 1
of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. X's portion of the group's tax benefit which it derived from using the 15 percent tax rate is $7,600 (0.8 × $9,500). See
Step 2.
The tax benefit inuring to the entire group from using the 15 percent and 25 percent tax brackets is $11,750 ($9,500 (from the 15 percent tax bracket) + $2,250 (from the 25 percent tax bracket)). So, X's percentage portion of the group's total tax benefit is $7,600/$11,750 (64.68%). See
Step 3.
Thus, X's allocated portion of the 5 percent additional tax from using the 15 percent tax bracket is $3,234 (0.6468 × $5,000). See
Step 4.
(
2
)
Amount of the additional tax apportioned to Y.
(
i
)
Regular tax apportioned to Y from using the 15 percent tax bracket.
Pursuant to the plan, Y was liable for the remaining $1,500 of the group's $7,500 regular tax (20%) owed under the 15 percent tax bracket. See
Step 1.
Y's portion of the group's tax benefit which it derived from using the 15 percent tax rate is $1,900 ($9,500−$7,600, or 0.2 × $9,500). See
Step 2.
So, Y's percentage portion of the group's total tax benefit is $1,900/$11,750 (16.17%). See
Step 3.
Thus, Y's allocated portion of the 5 percent additional tax from using the 15 percent tax bracket is $809 (0.1617 × $5,000). See
Step 4.
(
ii
)
Regular tax apportioned to Y from using the 25 percent tax bracket.
Pursuant to the plan, Y was liable for 100% of the group's regular tax owed under the 25 percent tax bracket, an amount of $6,250. See
Step 1.
Y is, therefore, entitled to 100% of the group's tax benefit which it derived from using this tax bracket, an amount of $2,250. See
Step 2.
So, Y's percentage portion of the group's total tax benefit is $2,250/$11,750 (19.15%). See
Step 3.
Thus, Y's allocated portion of the 5 percent additional tax from using the 25 percent tax bracket is $957 (0.1915 × $5,000). See
Step 4.
Y's total allocated portion of the additional tax is $1,766 ($809 + $957). See
Step 5.

except that on August 31, 2007, X of the X-Y-Z controlled group sold all of the stock of Z to M of the M-N controlled group, a pair of corporations unrelated to the X-Y group. Pursuant to the terms of the sales agreement, the members of the M-N group properly notified the members of the X-Y group on a timely basis that Z's taxable income for its 2007 tax year, as based on the group's December 31st testing date, was $100,000.
(ii)
Controlled group analysis.
On December 31st, 2007, X and Y are members of the selling controlled group and M, N and Z are members of the buying controlled group. However, pursuant to section 1563(b)(3), Z is treated as an additional member of the X-Y group on December31st 2007, since it was a member for at least one-half the number of days (243 out of 364) during the period beginning on January 1 and ending on December 30, 2007. Conversely, pursuant to section 1563(b)(2)(A), Z is treated as an excluded member of the M-N controlled group. Therefore, on December 31st, 2007, X, Y, and Z qualify as component members of the selling group, and only M and N qualify as component members of the buying group.
(iii)
Additional tax analysis.
With regard to X and Y's 2007 tax years, X and Y together owed $5,000 of additional tax, as calculated in
Example 1.
X's allocated portion of the additional tax is $3,234, as calculated in the manner set forth in
Example 1.
Y's allocated portion of the additional tax is $1,766, also as calculated in the manner set forth in
Example 1.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that in 2012, pursuant to an IRS audit, Z's 2007 taxable income was re-determined. It was adjusted by an income increase of $10,000. Pursuant to the terms of the sales agreement, the members of the M-N group timely notified the members of the X-Y group of Z's income adjustment.
(ii)
Additional tax analysis.
For 2007 the X-Y-Z group owed a revised additional tax in the amount of $5,500, allocated as follows: $3,557.40 to X and $1,942.60 to Y. X and Y each filed an amended 2007 tax return to report their portions of the $500 increase to the group's additional tax. Pursuant to their apportionment plan for allocating their regular tax, and as a result of defaulting to the proportionate method for allocating the group's additional tax, X reported $323.40 as its share of the group's increase to its additional tax and Y reported $176.60 as its share of the group's increase to its additional tax.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the members elected in their apportionment plan to adopt the FIFO method for apportioning the additional tax. Under the FIFO method, the 5 percent additional tax amount of $5,000 will be apportioned entirely to those members who would benefit from using the 15 percent tax bracket, by reason that $5,000 of the group's additional tax is less than $9,500, which is the full tax-benefit amount inuring to a controlled group from having a 15 percent tax rate applied to the full income bracket subject to that rate. Since X derived 80 percent of the group's tax benefit by its use of the 15 percent tax bracket, its share of the group's 5 percent additional tax is $4,000 (80% × $5,000), and Y's share of the group's 5 percent additional tax is, therefore, $1,000, which is the remaining amount of the group's 5 percent additional tax, attributable to the 15 percent tax bracket.
(b)
Reduction to the amount exempted from the alternative minimum tax
—(1)
Calculation.
The alternative minimum taxable incomes of the component members of a controlled group of corporations shall be taken into account
in calculating the reduction set forth in section 55(d)(3) to the amount exempted from the alternative minimum tax (the exemption amount). For purposes of the preceding sentence,
alternative minimum taxable income
means the positive alternative minimum taxable income of a component member for its entire tax year (even if it was not a member of the group for each day of that tax year) that includes the same December 31st testing date, which is also applicable to the other component members of that same controlled group.
(2)
Apportionment.
Any reduction to the exemption amount shall be apportioned to the component members of a controlled group in the same manner that the amount of the exemption (provided in section 55(d)(2)) to the alternative minimum tax was allocated under section 1561(a). For rules to apportion the section 55(d)(2) exemption amount among the component members of a controlled group, see § 1.1561-3(b) or (c).
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
A controlled group of corporations consists of three members: X, Y and Z. X owns all of the stock of Y and Z. Each corporation files its separate return on a calendar year basis. For calendar year 2007, the component members of this controlled group have an apportionment plan in effect. The group has chosen to apportion the entire section 55(d)(2) exemption amount of $40,000 to Z. For 2007, X had alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) of $40,000, Y had AMTI of $60,000 and Z had AMTI of $100,000. Thus the total AMTI of the group is $200,000.
(ii)
Calculating the reduction to the exemption amount.
Section 55(d)(3)(A) provides that the section 55(d)(2) exemption amount shall be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount equal to 25 percent of the amount by which the AMTI of a corporation exceeds $150,000. For the purpose of computing the group's AMTI, the AMTI of each of the component members, for their tax years that have the same December 31st testing date, shall be taken into account. In accordance with these provisions, the $40,000 exemption amount is reduced by $12,500 (25% × $50,000 ($200,000−$150,000)). Pursuant to the group's allocation plan, the entire $12,500 reduction to the exemption amount is allocated to Z. Thus, after such allocation, Z's $40,000 exemption amount is reduced to $27,500 ($40,000−$12,500).
(c)
Accumulated earnings credit.
The component members of a controlled group of corporations are permitted to allocate the amount of the accumulated earnings credit unequally if they have an apportionment plan in effect.
(d) [Reserved]
(e)
Short taxable years not including a December 31st date
—(1)
General rule.
If a corporation has a short taxable year not including a December 31st date and, after applying the rules of section 1561(b) and paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, it qualifies as a component member of the group with respect to its short taxable year (short-year member), then, for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, the amount of any tax-benefit item described in section 1561(b) allocated to that component member's short taxable year shall be the amount specified in section 1561(a) for that item, divided by the number of corporations which are component members of that group on the last day of that component member's short taxable year. The component members of such group may not apportion, by an apportionment plan, an amount of such tax-benefit item to any short-year member that differs from equal apportionment of that item.
(2)
Additional rules.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section—
(i) Section 1563(b) shall be applied as if the last day of the taxable year of a short-year member were substituted for December 31st; and
(ii) The term short taxable year does not refer to any portion of a tax year of a corporation for which its income is required to be included in a consolidated return pursuant to § 1.1502-76(b).
(3)
Calculation of the additional tax.
A short-year member (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) for its short taxable year calculates its additional tax liability imposed by section 11(b)(1) only on its own income, and therefore the subsequent calculation of the additional tax liability with regard to the remaining members of the group will not include the income of this short-year member.
(4)
Calculation of the alternative minimum tax.
If a component member has a tax year of less than 12 months, whether or not such tax year includes a December 31st date, see section 443(d) for
the annualization method required for calculating the alternative minimum tax.
(5)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Formation of a new member of a controlled group—(i)
Facts.

# On January 2, 2007, corporation X transfers cash to newly formed corporation Y (which begins business on that date) and receives all of the stock of Y in return. X also owns all of the stock of corporation Z on each day of 2006 and 2007. X, Y and Z have an apportionment plan in effect, apportioning the 15 percent taxbracket amount as follows: 40% ($20,000) to each of X and Y and 20% ($10,000) to Z. X, Y and Z each file a separate return with respect to the group's December 31st, 2007 testing date. X is on a calendar tax year and Z is on a fiscal tax year ending on March 31. Y adopts a fiscal year ending on June 30 and timely files a tax return for its short taxable year beginning on January 2, 2007, and ending on June 30, 2007.
(ii)
Y's short taxable year.
On June 30, 2007, Y is a component member of a parentsubsidiary controlled group of corporations composed of X, Y and Z. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the group may not apportion any amount of the 15 percent tax bracket to Y's short taxable year ending on June 30, 2007. Rather, Y is entitled to exactly
1/3
of such bracket amount, or $16,667.
(iii)
The members' subsequent tax years.
On December 31st, 2007, X, Y and Z are component members of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations. For their tax years that include December 31st, 2007 (X's calendar year ending December 31st, 2007, Z's fiscal year ending March 31, 2008 and Y's fiscal year ending June 30, 2008), X, Y and Z apportion among themselves the full amount of all of the applicable tax brackets pursuant to their apportionment plan. For example, 40% of the 15 percent tax-bracket amount, or $20,000, was apportioned to each of X and Y, and the remaining 10%, or $10,000, was apportioned to Z.

# Example 2. Allocating a tax bracket to the short taxable year of a liquidated member of a controlled group—(i)
Facts.

# On January 1, 2007, corporation P owns all of the stock of corporations S
1

# , S
2

# and S
3

# (the P group). Each of these four component members of the P group, with respect to the group's December 31st, 2007 testing date, files its separate return on a calendar year basis. These members have an apportionment plan in effect (the P group plan) under which S
1

# and S
2

# are each entitled to 40% of the 15 percent tax-bracket amount ($20,000), and P and S
3

# are each entitled to 10% of the 15 percent tax-bracket amount ($5,000). On May 31, 2007, S
1

# liquidates and therefore files a return for the short taxable year beginning on January 1, 2007, and ending on May 31, 2007. On July 31, 2007, S
2

# liquidates and therefore files a return for the short taxable year beginning on January 1, 2007 and ending on July 31, 2007. P and S
3

# each file a return for their 2007 calendar tax years.
(ii)
Apportionment of the 15 percent tax bracket to S
1
for its short taxable year.
On May 31, 2007, S
1
is a component member of the P group composed of P, S
1
, S
2
and S
3
. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the group may not apportion any amount of the 15 percent tax bracket to S
1
's short taxable year ending on June 30, 2007. Rather, S
1
is entitled to exactly
1/4
of such bracket amount, or $12,500.
(iii)
Apportionment of the 15 percent tax bracket to S
2
for its short taxable year.
On July 31, 2007, S
2
is a component member of the P group composed of P, S
2
and S
3
. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the group may not apportion any amount of the 15 percent tax bracket to S
2
's short taxable year ending on June 30, 2007. Rather, S
2
is entitled to exactly
1/4
of such bracket amount, or $16,667.
(iv)
Apportionment of the 15 percent tax bracket to P and S
3
for each of their calendar tax years.
On December 31st, 2007, P and S
3
are component members of the P group. Accordingly, for P and S
3
's 2007 calendar tax year, they are each apportioned $25,000 of the 15 percent tax bracket, pursuant to the applicable P group plan.

# Example 3. Liquidation of member after its transfer to another controlled group—(i)
Facts.

# The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that P, on April 30, 2007, sold all of the stock of S
2

# to the M-N controlled group. At the time of the sale, M and N are both unrelated to any members of the P group. As in Example 2, S
2

# liquidates on July 31, 2007, and therefore files a tax return for its short taxable year beginning on January 1, 2007, and ending on July 31, 2007. Pursuant to the sales agreement, the N-M group timely notified P that S
2

# had liquidated.
(ii)
Controlled group analysis.
On April 30, 2007, the date of the sale of S
2
, the P group reasonably expected that S
2
would be treated as an excluded member with respect to its December 31st, 2007 testing date. On that April 30th date, S
2
had been a member of the P group for less than one-half the number of days of what it expected would be a full 2007 calendar tax year preceding December 31st, 2007 (120 days (January 1-April 30) out of 364 days (January 1-December 30)). Yet, as a result of S
2
's subsequent liquidation by the M-N group prior to December 31st, 2007, S
2
became a component member of the P group with respect to the P group's December 31st, 2007 testing date. With respect to that December 31st testing date, S
2
thus was a member of the P group for more than one-half of the number of days of its tax year ending on July 31, 2007, which days proceeded December 31st, 2007 (120 days (January 1-April 30 of 2007) out of 211 days (January 1-July 30 of 2007)). The allocation of the 15 percent tax-
bracket amount to the P group members is determined in the same manner as in Example 2 and, therefore, the bracket amounts allocated to P, S
1
, S
2
and S
3
are the same as determined in Example 2. The allocation of the bracket amounts would be the same if, at the time P sold all of the S
2
stock, the parties had made a section 338(h)(10) election.

# Example 4. Short tax year including a December 31st date.
Corporation X owns all of the stock of corporations Y and Z. X, Y and Z each file separate returns. X and Y are on a calendar tax year and Z is on a fiscal tax year beginning October 1 and ending September 30. On January 2, 2007, Z liquidates. Because Z's final tax year (beginning on October 1, 2006 and ending on January 2, 2007) includes a December 31st date, that is, December 31, 2006, it is therefore not subject to the short taxable year rule provided by section 1561(b) and paragraph (e) of this section. Accordingly, Z is a component member of the X-Y-Z group, for the group's December 31st, 2006 testing date. Thus, the rules of this paragraph (e) do not limit the amount of any of the tax-benefit items of section 1561(a) available to Z or to this controlled group.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to any tax year beginning on or after December 21, 2009. However, taxpayers may apply this section to any Federal income tax return filed on or after December 21, 2009. For tax years beginning before December 21, 2009, see § 1.1561-2T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2009.
[T.D. 9476, 74 FR 68533, Dec. 28, 2009]
§ 1.1561-3
Allocation of the section 1561(a) tax items.
(a)
Filing of form
—(1)
In general.
For each tax year that a corporation is a component member of the same controlled group of corporations on a December 31st (its testing date), or, in the case of a short-year member (see section 1561(b) and § 1.1561-2(e)), the date substituted for that December 31st date (its testing date), such corporation and all the other component members of such group each must file the required form (that is, Schedule O or any successor form) with the Federal income tax return for that component member's tax year that includes a particular testing date. Each such corporation must file that form with its return whether or not—
(i) An apportionment plan is in effect; or
(ii) Any change is made to the group's apportionment of its section 1561(a) tax benefit items from the previous year.
(2)
Exception for component members that are members of a consolidated group.
If any of the component members of a controlled group of corporations are also members of a consolidated group, the parent of such consolidated group shall file only one form on behalf of all such members. Such form shall contain the information required for each such member.
(b)
No apportionment plan in effect.
If the component members of a controlled group of corporations do not have an apportionment plan in effect, the amounts of the section 1561(a) items must be divided equally among all such members. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if any of the component members of a controlled group of corporations are also members of a consolidated group, such members will each be treated as a separate component member of the controlled group.
(c)
Apportionment plan in effect
—(1)
Adoption of plan.
The component members of a controlled group of corporations consent to the adoption (or amendment) of an apportionment plan by checking the box to that effect on such form. For purposes of this paragraph (c)—
(i) An apportionment plan that is adopted (including a plan that has been amended) continues in effect until it is terminated;
(ii) A consolidated group is treated collectively as one component member of such group. This treatment occurs even where a member of that consolidated group has joined or left the group, if after such corporation joins or leaves the consolidated group, that group remains in existence, pursuant to § 1.1502-75(d); and
(iii) The members must allocate the amounts of the section 1561(a) items between/among themselves as described in the plan.
(2)
Limitation on adopting a plan
—(i)
Sufficient statute of limitations period for making an assessment of tax.
The members may only adopt or amend such a plan if there is at least one year remaining in the statutory period (including any extensions thereof) for the assessment of a deficiency against every member the tax liability of which would be increased by the adoption of such a plan.
(ii)
Insufficient statute of limitations period for making an assessment of tax.
If any member cannot satisfy the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the members may not adopt or amend such a plan unless the member not satisfying such requirement has entered into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to extend the statute of limitations for the limited purpose of assessing any deficiency against such member attributable to the adoption of such a plan.
(3)
Termination of plan.
An apportionment plan that is in effect for the component members of a controlled group with respect to a preceding December 31st is terminated with respect to the current December 31st if—
(i) Each member of such group consents to the termination of such a plan for the current December 31st by checking the box to that effect on its form;
(ii) The controlled group ceases to remain in existence (within the meaning of section 1563(a)) during the calendar year ending on the current December 31st;
(iii) Any corporation which was a component member of such group on the preceding December 31st is not a component member of such group on the current December 31st; or
(iv) Any corporation which was not a component member of such group on the preceding December 31st is a component member of such group on the current December 31st.
(d)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to any tax year beginning on or after December 21, 2009. However, taxpayers may apply this section to any Federal income tax return filed on or after December 21, 2009. For tax years beginning before December 21, 2009,
see
§ 1.1561-3T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2009.

§ 1.1563-1
Definition of controlled group of corporations and component members and related concepts.
(a)
Controlled group of corporations
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Types of controlled groups.
For purposes of sections 1561 through 1563, the term
controlled group of corporations
means any group of corporations which is—
(A) A
parent-subsidiary controlled group
(as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section);
(B) A
brother-sister controlled group
(as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section);
(C) A
combined group
(as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section); or
(D) A
life insurance controlled group
(as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section).
(ii)
Special rules.
In determining whether a corporation is included in a controlled group of corporations, section 1563(b) and paragraph (b) of this section shall not be taken into account. For rules defining a component member of a controlled group of corporations, including rules defining an excluded member and an additional member, see section 1563(b) and paragraph (b) of this section.
(iii)
Cross reference.
For the exclusion of certain stock for purposes of applying the definitions contained in this paragraph, see section 1563(c) and § 1.1563-2.
(2)
Parent-subsidiary controlled group
—(i)
Definition.
The term
parent-subsidiary controlled group
means one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation if—
(A) Stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 80 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each of the corporations, except the common parent corporation, is owned (directly and with the application of § 1.1563-3(b)(1), (2), and (3)) by one or more of the other corporations; and
(B) The common parent corporation owns (directly and with the application of § 1.1563-3(b)(1), (2), and (3)) stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 80 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of at least one of the other corporations, excluding, in computing such voting power or value, stock owned directly by such other corporations.
(ii)
Examples.
The definition of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
P Corporation owns stock possessing 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of S Corporation. P is the common parent of a parent-subsidiary controlled group consisting of member corporations P and S.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1.
Assume further that S owns stock possessing 80 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of X Corporation. P is the common parent of a parent-subsidiary controlled group consisting of member corporations P, S, and X. The result would be the same if P, rather than S, owned the X stock.

# Example 3.
P Corporation owns 80 percent of the only class of stock of S Corporation and S, in turn, owns 40 percent of the only class of stock of X Corporation. P also owns 80 percent of the only class of stock of Y Corporation and Y, in turn, owns 40 percent of the only class of stock of X. P is the common parent of a parent-subsidiary controlled group consisting of member corporations P, S, X, and Y.

# Example 4.
P Corporation owns 75 percent of the only class of stock of Y and Z Corporations; Y owns all the remaining stock of Z; and Z owns all the remaining stock of Y. Since intercompany stockholdings are excluded (that is, are not treated as outstanding) for purposes of determining whether P owns stock possessing at least 80 percent of the voting power or value of at least one of the other corporations, P is treated as the owner of stock possessing 100 percent of the voting power and value of Y and of Z for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section. Also, stock possessing 100 percent of the voting power and value of Y and Z is owned by the other corporations in the group within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section. (P and Y together own stock possessing 100 percent of the voting power and value of Z, and P and Z together own stock possessing 100 percent of the voting power and value of Y.) Therefore, P is the common parent of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations consisting of member corporations P, Y, and Z.
(3)
Brother-sister controlled group
—(i)
Definition.
The term
brother-sister controlled group
means two or more corporations if the same five or fewer persons who are individuals, estates, or trusts own (directly and with the application of the rules contained in § 1.1563-3(b)) stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or more than 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership of each such person only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation.
(ii)
Additional stock ownership requirement for purposes of certain other provisions of law.
For purposes of any provision of law (other than sections 1561 through 1563) that incorporates the section 1563(a) definition of a controlled group, the term
brother-sister controlled group
means two or more corporations if the same five or fewer persons who are individuals, estates, or trusts own (directly and with the application of the rules contained in § 1.1563-3(b)) stock possessing—
(A) At least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 80 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation (the 80 percent requirement);
(B) More than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or more than 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership of each such person only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation (the more-than-50 percent identical ownership requirement); and
(C) The five or fewer persons whose stock ownership is considered for purposes of the 80 percent requirement must be the same persons whose stock ownership is considered for purposes of the more-than-50 percent identical ownership requirement.
(iii)
Examples.
The principles of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) The outstanding stock of corporations P, W, X, Y, and Z, which have only one class of stock outstanding, is owned by the following unrelated individuals:

(ii) Corporations P and W are members of a brother-sister controlled group of corporations. Although the more-than-50 percent identical ownership requirement is met for all 5 corporations, corporations X, Y, and Z are not members because at least 80 percent of the stock of each of those corporations is not owned by the same 5 or fewer persons whose stock ownership is considered for purposes of the more-than-50 percent identical ownership requirement.

(ii) Any group of five of the shareholders will own more than 50 percent of the stock in each corporation, in identical holdings. However, X and Y are not members of a brother-sister controlled group because at least 80 percent of the stock of each corporation is not owned by the same five or fewer persons.

# Example 3.
(i) Corporation X and Y each have two classes of stock outstanding, voting common and non-voting common. (None of this stock is excluded from the definition of stock under section 1563(c).) Unrelated individuals A and B own the following percentages of the class of stock entitled to vote (voting) and of the total value of shares of all classes of stock (value) in each of corporations X and Y:
Individuals
Corporations
X
Y
A
100% voting; 60% value
75% voting; 60% value.
B
0% voting; 10% value
25% voting; 10% value.
(ii) No other shareholder of X owns (or is considered to own) any stock in Y. X and Y are a brother-sister controlled group of corporations. The group meets the more-than-50 percent identical ownership requirement because A and B own more than 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of X and Y in identical holdings. (The group also meets the more-than-50 percent identical ownership requirement because of A's voting stock ownership.) The group meets the 80 percent requirement because A and B own at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3
except that the value of the stock owned by A and B is not more than 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation in identical holdings. X and Y are not a brother-sister controlled group of corporations. The group meets the more-than-50 percent identical ownership requirement because A owns more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of the voting stock of each corporation. For purposes of the 80 percent requirement, B's voting stock in Y cannot be combined with A's voting stock in Y since B, who does not own any voting stock in X, is not a person whose ownership is considered for purposes of the more-than-50 percent identical ownership requirement. Because no other shareholder owns stock in both X and Y, these other shareholders' stock ownership is not counted towards meeting either the more-than-50 percent identical ownership requirement or the 80 percent ownership requirement.
(iv)
Special rule if prior law applies.
Paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, as amended by TD 8179, applies to taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1970. See, however, the transitional rule in paragraph (d) of this section.
(4)
Combined group
—(i)
Definition.
The term
combined group
means any group of three or more corporations if—
(A) Each such corporation is a member of either a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations or a brother-sister controlled group of corporations; and
(B) At least one of such corporations is the common parent of a parent-subsidiary controlled group and also is a member of a brother-sister controlled group.
(ii)
Examples.
The definition of a combined group of corporations may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, an individual, owns stock possessing 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of the stock of corporations X and Y. Y, in turn, owns stock possessing 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of the stock of corporation Z. X, Y, and Z are members of the same combined group since—
(i) X, Y, and Z are each members of either a parent-subsidiary or brother-sister controlled group of corporations; and
(ii) Y is the common parent of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations consisting of Y and Z, and also is a member of a brother-sister controlled group of corporations consisting of X and Y.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
and further assume that corporation X owns 80 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of corporation S. X, Y, Z, and S are members of the same combined group.
(5)
Life insurance controlled group
—(i)
Definition.
The term
life insurance controlled group
means two or more life insurance companies each of which is a member of a controlled group of corporations described in paragraph (a)(2), (a)(3)(i), or (a)(4) of this section and to which § 1.1502-47(f)(6) does not apply. Such insurance companies shall be treated as a controlled group of corporations separate from any other corporations which are members of a controlled group described in such paragraph (a)(2), (a)(3)(i), or (a)(4) of this section. For purposes of this section, the common parent of the controlled group described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be referred to as the common parent of the life insurance controlled group.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the definition of a
life insurance controlled group.
In these examples, L indicates a life company, another letter indicates a nonlife company and each corporation uses the calendar year as its taxable year:

# Example 1.
Since January 1, 1999, corporation P has owned all the stock of corporations L
1
and Y, and L
1
has owned all the stock of corporation X. On January 1, 2005, Y acquired all of the stock of corporation L
2.
Since L
1
and L
2
are members of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations, such companies are treated as members of a life insurance controlled group separate from the parent-subsidiary controlled group consisting of P, X and Y. For purposes of this section, P is referred to as the common parent of the life insurance controlled group even though P is not a member of such group.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that, beginning with the 2005 tax year, the P affiliated group elected to file a consolidated return and P made a section 1504(c)(2) election. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, L
1
and L
2
are not members of a separate life insurance controlled group. Instead, P, X, Y, L
1
and L
2
constitute one controlled group. See § 1.1502-47(f)(6).
(6)
Voting power of stock.
For purposes of this section, and §§ 1.1563-2 and 1.1563-3, in determining whether the stock owned by a person (or persons) possesses a certain percentage of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of a corporation, consideration will be given to all the facts and circumstances of each case. A share of stock will generally be considered as possessing the voting power accorded to such share by the corporate charter, by-laws, or share certificate. On the other hand, if there is any agreement, whether express or implied, that a shareholder will not vote the shareholder's stock in a corporation, the formal voting rights possessed by the shareholder's stock may be disregarded in determining the percentage of the total combined voting power possessed by the stock owned by other shareholders in the corporation, if the result is that the corporation becomes a component member of a controlled group of corporations. Moreover, if a shareholder agrees to vote the shareholder's stock in a corporation in the manner specified by another shareholder in the corporation, the voting rights possessed by the stock owned by the first shareholder may be considered to be possessed by the stock owned by such other shareholder if the result is that the corporation becomes a component member of a controlled group of corporations.
(b)
Component members
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Definition.
For purposes of sections 1561 through 1563, a corporation is with respect to its taxable year a component member of a controlled group of corporations for the group's testing date if such corporation—
(A) Is a member of such controlled group on such testing date and is not treated as an excluded member under paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or
(B) Is not a member of such controlled group on such testing date but is treated as an additional member under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Member of a controlled group of corporations.
For purposes of sections 1561 through 1563, a member of a controlled group is a corporation connected with other member(s) of a controlled group under the stock ownership rules and the stock qualification rules set forth in section 1563. Under these rules, for a corporation to qualify as a component member of the group with respect to a group's December 31st testing date (or the short-year testing date for a short-year member), that corporation does not have to be a member of that group on that group's testing date. In addition, a corporation that is a member of a controlled group on the group's testing date does not necessarily qualify as a component member of that group with respect to that testing date.
(iii)
Additional concepts used in applying the controlled group rules.
(A) The term
testing date
means the date used for determining the status of controlled group members as either component members or excluded members. That testing date is then also used to determine which taxable years of those component members are to be subjected to the controlled group rules. Generally, a member's testing date is the December 31st date included within that member's taxable year, whether such member is on a calendar or fiscal taxable year. However, if a component member of a controlled group has a short taxable year that does not include a December 31st date, then the last day of that short taxable year becomes that member's testing date.
(B) The term
testing period
means the time period used for determining the status of controlled group members as either component members or excluded members. The testing period begins on the first day of a member's taxable year and ends on the day before its testing date. (Generally, the testing date is December 31st, but for a component member having a short taxable year not ending on December 31st, the testing date for the short taxable year of that member (and only that member) becomes the last day of that member's short taxable year.) Thus, for a member on a fiscal taxable year, the portion of its taxable year beginning on December 31st and ending on the last day of its taxable year is not taken into account for determining its status as a component member or an excluded member.
(2)
Excluded members
—(i)
Temporal test.
A corporation, which is a member of a controlled group of corporations on the group's testing date, a date included within that member's taxable year, but who was a member of such group for less than one-half of the number of days of its testing period, shall be treated as an excluded member of such group for that group's testing date.
(ii)
Qualification test.
A corporation which is a member of a controlled group of corporations on a testing date shall be treated as an excluded member of such group on such date if, for its taxable year including such date, such corporation is—
(A) Exempt from taxation under section 501(a) (except a corporation which is subject to tax on its unrelated business taxable income under section 511) or 521 for such taxable year;
(B) A foreign corporation not subject to taxation under section 882(a) for the taxable year;
(C) An S corporation (as defined in section 1361) for purposes of any tax benefit item described in section 1561(a) to which it is not subject;
(D) A franchised corporation (as defined in section 1563(f)(4) and § 1.1563-4); or
(E) An insurance company subject to taxation under section 801, unless such insurance company (without regard to this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E)) is a component member of a life insurance controlled group described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section or unless § 1.1502-47(f)(6) applies (which treats a life insurance company, for which a section 1504(c)(2) election is effective, as a member (whether eligible or ineligible) of a life-nonlife affiliated group).
(3)
Additional members.
A corporation shall be treated as an additional member of a controlled group of corporations, that is, an additional component member, on the group's testing date if it—
(i) Is not a member of such group on such date;
(ii) Is not described, with respect to such taxable year, in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A), (b)(2)(ii)(B), (b)(2)(ii)(C), (b)(2)(ii)(D), or (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section; and
(iii) Was a member of such group for one-half (or more) of the number of days in its testing period.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following examples:
(i)
Example 1.
B, an individual, owns all of the stock of corporations W and X on each day of 1964. W and X each use the calendar year as their taxable year. On January 1, 1964, B also owns all the stock of corporation Y (a fiscal year corporation with a taxable year beginning on July 1, 1964, and ending on June 30, 1965), which stock B sells on October 15, 1964. On December 1, 1964, B purchases all the stock of corporation Z (a fiscal year corporation with a taxable year beginning on September 1, 1964, and ending on August 31, 1965). On December 31, 1964, W, X, and Z are members of the same controlled group. However, the component members of the group on such December 31st are W, X, and Y. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, Z is treated as an excluded member of the group on December 31, 1964, since Z was a member of the group for less than one-half of the number of days (29 out of 121 days) during the period beginning on September 1, 1964 (the first day of its taxable year) and ending on December 30, 1964. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, Y is treated as an additional member of the group on December 31, 1964, since Y was a member of the group for at least one-half of the number of days (107 out of 183 days) during the period beginning on July 1, 1964 (the first day of its taxable year) and ending on December 30, 1964.
(ii)
Example 2.
On January 1, 1964, corporation P owns all the stock of corporation S, which in turn owns all the stock of corporation S-1. On November 1, 1964, P purchases all of the stock of corporation X from the public and sells all of the stock of S to the public. Corporation X owns all the stock of corporation Y during 1964. P, S, S-1, X, and Y file their returns on the basis of the calendar year. On December 31, 1964, P, X, and Y are members of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations; also, corporations S and S-1 are members of a different parent-subsidiary controlled group on such date. However, since X and Y have been members of the parent-subsidiary controlled group of which P is the common parent for less than one-half the number of days during the period January 1 through December 30, 1964, they are not component members of such group on such date. On the other hand, X and Y have been members of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of which X is the common parent for at least one-half the number of days during the period January 1 through December 30, 1964, and therefore they are component members of such group on December 31, 1964. Also since S and S-1 were members of the parent-subsidiary controlled group of which P is the common parent for at least one-half the number of days in the taxable years of each such corporation during the period January 1 through December 30, 1964, P, S, and S-1 are component members of such group on December 31, 1964.
(iii)
Example 3.
Throughout 1964, corporation M owns all the stock of corporation F which, in turn, owns all the stock of corporations L
1
, L
2
, X, and Y. M is a domestic mutual insurance company subject to taxation under section 821, F is a foreign corporation not engaged in a trade or business within the United States, L
1
and L
2
are domestic life insurance companies subject to taxation under section 802, and X and Y are domestic corporations subject to tax under section 11 of the Code. Each corporation uses the calendar year as its taxable year. On December 31, 1964, M, F, L
1
, L
2
, X, and Y are members of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations. However, under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, M, F, L
1
, and L
2
are treated as excluded members of the group on December 31, 1964. Thus, on December 31, 1964, the component members of the parent-subsidiary
controlled group of which M is the common parent include only X and Y.
Furthermore, since paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section does not result in L
1
and L
2
being treated as excluded members of a life insurance controlled group, L
1
and L
2
are component members of a life insurance controlled group on December 31, 1964.
(iv)
Example 4.
Individual A owns all of the stock of corporations X, Y and Z. Each of these corporations is an S corporation. X, Y, and Z are each members of a brother-sister controlled group, even though each such corporation is treated as an excluded member of such group. See § 1.1563-1(b)(2)(ii)(C).
(5)
Application of constructive ownership rules.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(3)(iii) of this section, it is necessary to determine whether a corporation was a member of a controlled group of corporations for one-half (or more) of the number of days in its taxable year which precede the December 31st falling within such taxable year. Therefore, the constructive ownership rules contained in § 1.1563-3(b) (to the extent applicable in making such determination) must be applied on a day-by-day basis. For example, if P Corporation owns all the stock of X Corporation on each day of 1964, and on December 30, 1964, acquires an option to purchase all the stock of Y Corporation (a calendar-year taxpayer which has been in existence on each day of 1964), the application of § 1.1563-3(b)(1) on a day-by-day basis results in Y being a member of the brother-sister controlled group on only one day of Y's 1964 year which precedes December 31, 1964. Accordingly, since Y is not a member of such group for one-half or more of the number of days in its 1964 year preceding December 31, 1964, Y is treated as an excluded member of such group on December 31, 1964.
(c)
Overlapping groups
—(1)
In general.
If on a December 31st a corporation is a component member of a controlled group of corporations by reason of ownership of stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of the corporation, and if on such December 31st such corporation is also a component member of another controlled group of corporations by reason of ownership of other stock (that is, stock not used to satisfy the at-least-80 percent total value test) possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the corporation entitled to vote, then such corporation shall be treated as a component member only of the controlled group of which it is a component member by reason of the ownership of at least 80 percent of the total value of its shares.
(2)
Brother-sister controlled groups
—(i)
One corporation.
If on a December 31st, a corporation would, without the application of this paragraph (c)(2), be a component member of more than one brother-sister controlled group on such date, the corporation will be treated as a component member of only one such group on such date. Such corporation may elect the group in which it is to be included by including on or with its income tax return for the taxable year that includes such date a statement entitled, “STATEMENT TO ELECT CONTROLLED GROUP PURSUANT TO § 1.1563-1(c)(2).” This statement must include—
(A) A description of each of the controlled groups in which the corporation could be included. The description must include the name and employer identification number of each component member of each such group and the stock ownership of the component members of each such group; and
(B) The following representation: [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF CORPORATION] ELECTS TO BE TREATED AS A COMPONENT MEMBER OF THE [INSERT DESIGNATION OF GROUP].
(ii)
Multiple corporations.
If more than one corporation would, without the application of this paragraph (c)(2), be a component member of more than one controlled group, those corporations electing to be component members of the same group must file a single statement. The statement must contain the information described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, plus the names and employer identification numbers of all other corporations designating the same group. The original statement must be included on or with the original Federal income tax return (including any amended return filed on or before the due date (including extensions)
of such return) of the corporation that, among those corporations which would (without the application of this paragraph (c)(2)) belong to more than one group, has the taxable year including such December 31st which ends on the earliest date. That corporation must provide a copy of the statement to each other corporation included in the statement and represent in its statement that it has done so. Either the original or a copy of the statement must be retained by each corporation as part of its records. See § 1.6001-1(e) of this chapter.
(iii)
Election.
(A) An election filed under this paragraph (c)(2) is irrevocable and effective until a change in the stock ownership of the corporation results in termination of membership in the controlled group in which such corporation has been included.
(B) In the event no election is filed in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c)(2), then the Internal Revenue Service will determine the group in which such corporation is to be included. Such determination will be binding for all subsequent years unless the corporation files a valid election with respect to any such subsequent year or until a change in the stock ownership of the corporation results in termination of membership in the controlled group in which such corporation has been included.
(iv)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (c)(2) may be illustrated by the following examples (in which it is assumed that all the individuals are unrelated):

# Example 1.
(i) On each day of 1970 all the outstanding stock of corporations X, Y, and Z is held in the following manner:
Individuals
Corporations
X (%)
Y (%)
Z (%)
A
55
40
5
B
40
20
40
C
5
40
55
(ii) Since the more-than-50 percent identical ownership requirement of section 1563(a)(2) is met with respect to corporations X and Y and with respect to corporations Y and Z, but not with respect to corporations X, Y, and Z, corporation Y would, without the application of this paragraph (c)(2), be a component member on December 31, 1970, of overlapping groups consisting of X and Y and of Y and Z. If Y does not file an election in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will determine the group in which Y is to be included.

# Example 2.
(i) On each day of 1970, all the outstanding stock of corporations V, W, X, Y, and Z is held in the following manner:
Individuals
Corporations
V
W
X
Y

(ii) On December 31, 1970, the more-than-50 percent identical ownership requirement of section 1563(a)(2) may be met with regard to any combination of the corporations but all five corporations cannot be included as component members of a single controlled group because the inclusion of all the corporations in a single group would be dependent upon taking into account the stock ownership of more than five persons. Therefore, if the corporations do not file a statement in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will determine the group in which each corporation is to be included. The corporations or the Internal Revenue Service, as the case may be, may designate that three corporations be included in one group and two corporations in another, or that any four corporations be included in one group and that the remaining corporation not be included in any group.
(d)
Transitional rules
—(1)
In general.
Treasury decision 8179 amended paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section to revise the definition of a brother-sister controlled group of corporations. In general, those amendments are effective for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1970.
(2)
Limited nonretroactivity
—(i)
Old group.
Under the authority of section 7805(b), the Internal Revenue Service will treat an old group as a brother-sister controlled group corporations for purposes of applying sections 401, 404(a), 408(k), 409A, 410, 411, 412, 414, 415, and 4971 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and sections 202, 203, 204, and 302 of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) in a plan year or taxable year beginning before March 2, 1988, to the extent necessary to prevent an adverse effect on any old member (or any other corporation), or on any plan or other entity described
in such sections (including plans, etc., of corporations not part of such old group), that would result solely from the retroactive effect of the amendment to this section by TD 8179. An adverse effect includes the disqualification of a plan or the disallowance of a deduction or credit for a contribution to a plan. The Internal Revenue Service, however, will not treat an old member as a member of an old group to the extent that such treatment will have an adverse effect on that old member.
(ii)
Old member of old group.
Section 7805(b) will not be applied pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section to treat an old member of an old group as a member of a brother-sister controlled group to prevent an adverse effect for a taxable year if, for that taxable year, that old member treats or has treated itself as not being a member of that old group for purposes of sections 401, 404(a), 408(k), 409A, 410, 411, 412, 414, 415, and 4971 of the Code and sections 202, 203, 204, and 302 and title IV of ERISA for such taxable year (such as by filing, with respect to such taxable year, a return, amended return, or claim for credit or refund in which the amount of any deduction, credit, limitation, or tax due is determined by treating itself as not being a member of the old group for purposes of those sections). However, the fact that one or more (but not all) of the old members do not qualify for section 7805(b) treatment because of the preceding sentence will not preclude that old member (or members) from being treated as a member of the old group under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section in order to prevent the disallowance of a deduction or credit of another old member (or other corporation) or to prevent the disqualification of, or other adverse effect on, another old member's plan (or other entity) described in the sections of the Code and ERISA enumerated in such paragraph.
(3)
Election of general nonretroactivity.
In the case of a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1970, and before March 2, 1988, an old group will be treated as a brother-sister controlled group of corporations for all purposes of the Code for such taxable year if—
(i) Each old member files a statement consenting to such treatment for such taxable year with the District Director having audit jurisdiction over its return within six months after March 2, 1988; and
(ii) No old member—
(A) Files or has filed, with respect to such taxable year, a return, amended return, or claim for credit or refund in which the amount of any deduction, credit, limitation, or tax due is determined by treating any old member as not a member of the old group; or
(B) Treats the employees of all members of the old group as not being employed by a single employer for purposes of sections 401, 404(a), 408(k), 409A, 410, 411, 412, 414, 415, and 4971 of the Code and sections 202, 203, 204, and 302 of ERISA for such taxable year.
(4)
Definitions.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)—
(i) An
old group
is a brother-sister controlled group of corporations, determined by applying paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section as in effect before the amendments made by TD 8179, that is not a brother-sister controlled group of corporations, determined by applying paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section as amended by such Treasury decision; and
(ii) An
old member
is any corporation that is a member of an old group.
(5)
Election to choose between membership in more than one controlled group
—(i)
In general.
A corporation may make an election under paragraph (c)(2) of this section by filing an amended return on or before September 2, 1988 if—
(A) An old member has filed an election under paragraph (c)(2) of this section to be treated as a component member of an old group for a December 31st before March 2, 1988; and
(B) That corporation would (without regard to such paragraph (c)(2)) be a component member of more than one brother-sister controlled group (not including an old group) on December 31st.
(ii)
Exception.
This paragraph (d)(5) does not apply to a corporation that is treated as a member of an old group under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(6)
Refunds.
See section 6511(a) for period of limitation on filing claims for credit or refund.

§ 1.1563-2
Excluded stock.
(a)
Certain stock excluded.
For purposes of sections 1561 through 1563 and the regulations thereunder, the term “stock” does not include:
(1) Nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends, and
(2) Treasury stock.
(b)
Stock treated as excluded stock
—(1)
Parent-subsidiary controlled group.
If a corporation (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as “parent corporation”) owns 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or 50 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock in another corporation (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as “subsidiary corporation”), the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall apply. For purposes of this subparagraph, stock owned by a corporation means stock owned directly plus stock owned with the application of the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (b) (1) and (4) of § 1.1563-3, relating to options and attribution from corporations. In determining whether the stock owned by a corporation possesses the requisite percentage of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of another corporation, see paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.1563-1.
(2)
Stock treated as not outstanding.
If the provisions of this subparagraph apply, then for purposes of determining whether the parent corporation or the subsidiary corporation is a member of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1563-1, the following stock of the subsidiary corporation shall, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, be treated as if it were not outstanding:
(i)
Plan of deferred compensation.
Stock in the subsidiary corporation held by a trust which is part of a plan of deferred compensation for the benefit of the employees of the parent corporation or the subsidiary corporation. The term “plan of deferred compensation” shall have the same meaning such term has in section 406(a)(3) and the regulations thereunder.
(ii)
Principal stockholders and officers.
Stock in the subsidiary corporation owned (directly and with the application of the rules contained in paragraph (b) of § 1.1563-3) by an individual who is a principal stockholder or officer of the parent corporation. A principal stockholder of the parent corporation is an individual who owns (directly and with the application of the rules contained in paragraph (b) of § 1.1563-3) 5 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or 5 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of the parent corporation. An officer of the parent corporation includes the president, vice-presidents, general manager, treasurer, secretary, and comptroller of such corporation, and any other person who performs duties corresponding to those normally performed by persons occupying such positions.
(iii)
Employees.
Stock in the subsidiary corporation owned (directly and with the application of the rules contained in § 1.1563-3(b)) by an employee of the subsidiary corporation if such stock is subject to conditions which substantially restrict or limit the employee's right (or if the employee constructively owns such stock, the direct owner's right) to dispose of such stock and which run in favor of the parent or subsidiary corporation. In general, any condition which extends, directly or indirectly, to the parent corporation or the subsidiary corporation preferential rights with respect to the acquisition of the employee's (or direct owner's)
stock will be considered to be a condition described in the preceding sentence. It is not necessary, in order for a condition to be considered to be in favor of the parent corporation or the subsidiary corporation, that the parent or subsidiary be extended a discriminatory concession with respect to the price of the stock. For example, a condition whereby the parent corporation is given a right of first refusal with respect to any stock of the subsidiary corporation offered by an employee for sale is a condition which substantially restricts or limits the employee's right to dispose of such stock and runs in favor of the parent corporation. Moreover, any legally enforceable condition which prohibits the employee from disposing of the employee's stock without the consent of the parent (or a subsidiary of the parent) will be considered to be a substantial limitation running in favor of the parent corporation.
(iv)
Controlled exempt organization.
Stock in the subsidiary corporation owned (directly and with the application of the rules contained in paragraph (b) of § 1.1563-3) by an organization (other than the parent corporation):
(
a
) To which section 501 (relating to certain educational and charitable organizations which are exempt from tax) applies, and
(
b
) Which is controlled directly or indirectly by the parent corporation or subsidiary corporation, by an individual, estate, or trust that is a principal stockholder of the parent corporation, by an officer of the parent corporation, or by any combination thereof.
The terms “principal stockholder of the parent corporation” and “officer of the parent corporation” shall have the same meanings in this subdivision as in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. The term “control” as used in this subdivision means control in fact and the determination of whether the control requirement of (
b
) of this subdivision is met will depend upon all the facts and circumstances of each case, without regard to whether such control is legally enforceable and irrespective of the method by which such control is exercised or exercisable.
(3)
Brother-sister controlled group.
If five or fewer persons (hereinafter referred to as common owners) who are individuals, estates, or trusts own (directly and with the application of the rules contained in paragraph (b) of § 1.1563-3) stock possessing 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or 50 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock in a corporation, the provisions of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph shall apply. In determining whether the stock owned by such person or persons possesses the requisite percentage of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of a corporation, see paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.1563-1.
(4)
Stock treated as not outstanding.
If the provisions of this subparagraph apply, then for purposes of determining whether a corporation is a member of a brother-sister controlled group of corporations within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1563-1, the following stock of such corporation shall, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, be treated as if it were not outstanding:
(i)
Exempt employees' trust.
Stock in such corporation held by an employees' trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a), if such trust is for the benefit of the employees of such corporation.
(ii)
Employees.
Stock in such corporation owned (directly and with the application of the rules contained in § 1.1563-3(b)) by an employee of such corporation if such stock is subject to conditions which run in favor of a common owner of such corporation (or in favor of such corporation) and which substantially restrict or limit the employee's right (or if the employee constructively owns such stock, the record owner's right) to dispose of such stock. The principles of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section apply in determining whether a condition satisfies the requirements of the preceding sentence. Thus, in general, a condition which extends, directly or indirectly, to a common owner or such corporation preferential rights with respect to the acquisition of the employee's (or record owner's) stock will be considered to be
a condition which satisfies such requirements. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), if a condition which restricts or limits an employee's right (or record owner's right) to dispose of the employee's (or record owner's) stock also applies to the stock in such corporation held by such common owner pursuant to a bona fide reciprocal stock purchase arrangement, such condition is not treated as one which restricts or limits the employee's (or record owner's) right to dispose of such stock. An example of a reciprocal stock purchase arrangement is an agreement whereby a common owner and the employee are given a right of first refusal with respect to stock of the employer corporation owned by the other party. If, however, the agreement also provides that the common owner has the right to purchase the stock of the employer corporation owned by the employee in the event that the corporation should discharge the employee for reasonable cause, the purchase arrangement would not be reciprocal within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii).
(iii)
Controlled exempt organization.
Stock in such corporation owned (directly and with the application of the rules contained in paragraph (b) of § 1.1563-3) by an organization:
(
a
) To which section 501(c)(3) (relating to certain educational and charitable organizations which are exempt from tax) applies, and
(
b
) Which is controlled directly or indirectly by such corporation, by an individual, estate, or trust that is a principal stockholder of such corporation, by an officer of such corporation, or by any combination thereof.
The terms “principal stockholder” and “officer” shall have the same meanings in this subdivision as in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph. The term “control” as used in this subdivision means control in fact and the determination of whether the control requirement of (
b
) of this subdivision is met will depend upon all the facts and circumstances of each case, without regard to whether such control is legally enforceable and irrespective of the method by which such control is exercised or exercisable.
(5)
Other controlled groups.
The provisions of subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph shall apply in determining whether a corporation is a member of a combined group (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of § 1.1563-1) or an insurance group (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.1563-1). For example, under paragraph (a)(4) of § 1.1563-1, in order for a corporation to be a member of a combined group such corporation must be a member of a parent-subsidiary group or a brother-sister group. Accordingly, the excluded stock rules provided by this paragraph are applicable in determining whether the corporation is a member of such group.
(6)
Meaning of employee.
For purposes of this section §§ 1.1563-3 and 1.1563-4, the term “employee” has the same meaning such term is given in section 3306(i) of the Code (relating to definitions for purposes of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act). Accordingly, the term employee as used in such sections includes an officer of a corporation.
(7)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:
(i)
Example 1.
Corporation P owns 70 of the 100 shares of the only class of stock of corporation S. The remaining shares of S are owned as follows: 4 shares by Jones (the general manager of P), and 26 shares by Smith (who also owns 5 percent of the total combined voting power of the stock of P). P satisfies the 50 percent stock ownership requirement of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph with respect to S. Since Jones is an officer of P and Smith is a principal stockholder of P, under subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph the S stock owned by Jones and Smith is treated as not outstanding for purposes of determining whether P and S are members of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1563-1. Thus, P is considered to own stock possessing 100 percent (70 ÷ 70) of the total voting power and value of all the S stock. Accordingly, P and S are members of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations.
(ii)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section (
Example 1
), except that Jones owns 15
shares of the 100 shares of the only class of stock of corporation S-1, and corporation S owns 75 shares of such stock. P satisfies the 50 percent stock ownership requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to S-1 since P is considered as owning 52.5 percent (70 percent × 75 percent) of the S-1 stock with the application of § 1.1563-3(b)(4). Since Jones is an officer of P, under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the S-1 stock owned by Jones is treated as not outstanding for purposes of determining whether S-1 is a member of the parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations. Thus, S is considered to own stock possessing 88.2 percent (75 ÷ 85) of the voting power and value of the S-1 stock. Accordingly, P, S, and S-1 are members of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations.
(iii)
Example 3.
Corporation X owns 60 percent of the only class of stock of corporation Y. D, the president of Y, owns the remaining 40 percent of the stock of Y. D has agreed that, if D offers D's stock in Y for sale, D will first offer the stock to X at a price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the first date the stock is offered for sale. Since D is an employee of Y within the meaning of section 3306(i) of the Code, and D's stock in Y is subject to a condition which substantially restricts or limits D's right to dispose of such stock and runs in favor of X, under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section such stock is treated as if it were not outstanding for purposes of determining whether X and Y are members of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations. Thus, X is considered to own stock possessing 100 percent of the voting power and value of the stock of Y. Accordingly, X and Y are members of a parent-subsidiary controlled group of corporations. The result would be the same if D's spouse, instead of D, owned directly the 40 percent stock interest in Y and such stock was subject to a right of first refusal running in favor of X.
(c)
Exception
—(1)
General.
If stock of a corporation is owned by a person directly or with the application of the rules contained in paragraph (b) of § 1.1563-3 and such ownership results in the corporation being a component member of a controlled group of corporations on a December 31, then the stock shall not be treated as excluded stock under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section if the result of applying such provisions is that such corporation is not a component member of a controlled group of corporations on such December 31.
(2)
Illustration.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On each day of 1965, corporation P owns directly 50 of the 100 shares of the only class of stock of corporation S. Jones, an officer of P, owns directly 30 shares of S stock and P has an option to acquire such 30 shares from Jones. The remaining shares of S are owned by unrelated persons. If, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the 30 shares of S stock owned directly by Jones is treated as not outstanding, the result is that P would be treated as owning stock possessing only 71 percent (50 ÷ 70) of the total voting power and value of S stock, and S would not be a component member of a controlled group of corporations on December 31, 1965. However, since P is considered as owning the 30 shares of S stock with the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and such ownership plus the S stock directly owned by P (50 shares) results in S being a component member of a controlled group of corporations on December 31, 1965, the provisions of this paragraph apply. Therefore, the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section do not apply with respect to the 30 shares of S stock, and on December 31, 1965, S is a component member of a controlled group of corporations consisting of P and S.
(d)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning on or after December 30, 2024. For taxable years beginning before December 30, 2024,
see
§ 1.1563-2 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2024.
[T.D. 6845, 30 FR 9753, Aug. 5, 1965, as amended by T.D. 7181, 37 FR 8070, Apr. 4, 1972; TD 10018, 89 FR 106879, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.1563-3
Rules for determining stock ownership.
(a)
In general.
In determining stock ownership for purposes of §§ 1.1562-5, 1.1563-1, 1.1563-2, and this section, the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (b) of this section apply to the extent such rules are referred to in such sections. The application of such rules shall be subject to the operating
rules and special rules contained in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
(b)
Constructive ownership
—(1)
Options.
If a person has an option to acquire any outstanding stock of a corporation, such stock shall be considered as owned by such person. For purposes of this subparagraph, an option to acquire such an option, and each one of a series of such options, shall be considered as an option to acquire such stock. For example, assume Smith owns an option to purchase 100 shares of the outstanding stock of M Corporation. Under this subparagraph, Smith is considered to own such 100 shares. The result would be the same if Smith owned an option to acquire the option (or one of a series of options) to purchase 100 shares of M stock.
(2)
Attribution from partnerships.
(i)
Rule.
Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a partnership is considered as owned by any partner having an interest of 5 percent or more in either the capital or profits of the partnership in proportion to the partner's interest in capital or profits, whichever such proportion is the greater.
(ii)
Example
—(A)
Facts.
Green, Jones, and White are unrelated individuals and are partners in the GJW partnership. The partners' interests in the capital and profits of the partnership are as follows:

(B)
Analysis.
The GJW partnership owns the entire outstanding stock (100 shares) of X Corporation. Under this paragraph (b)(2), Green is considered to own the X stock owned by the partnership in proportion to Green's interest in capital (36 percent) or profits (25 percent), whichever such proportion is the greater. Therefore, Green is considered to own 36 shares of the X stock. However, since Jones has a greater interest in the profits of the partnership, Jones is considered to own the X stock in proportion to Jones's interest in such profits. Therefore, Jones is considered to own 71 shares of the X stock. Since White does not have an interest of 5 percent or more in either the capital or profits of the partnership, White is not considered to own any shares of the X stock.
(3)
Attribution from estates or trusts.
(i) Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for an estate or trust is considered as owned by any beneficiary who has an actuarial interest of 5 percent or more in such stock, to the extent of such actuarial interest. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(i), the actuarial interest of each beneficiary is determined by assuming the maximum exercise of discretion by the fiduciary in favor of such beneficiary and the maximum use of such stock to satisfy the beneficiary's rights as a beneficiary. A beneficiary of an estate or trust who cannot under any circumstances receive any interest in stock held by the estate or trust, including the proceeds from the disposition thereof, or the income therefrom, does not have an actuarial interest in such stock. Thus, where stock owned by a decedent's estate has been specifically bequeathed to certain beneficiaries and the remainder of the estate is bequeathed to other beneficiaries, the stock is attributable only to the beneficiaries to whom it is specifically bequeathed. Similarly, a remainderman of a trust who cannot under any circumstances receive any interest in the stock of a corporation which is a part of the corpus of the trust (including any accumulated income therefrom or the proceeds from a disposition thereof) does not have an actuarial interest in such stock. However, an income beneficiary of a trust does have an actuarial interest in stock if that beneficiary has any right to the income from such stock even though under the terms of the trust instrument such stock can never be distributed to that beneficiary. The factors and methods prescribed in § 20.2031-7 of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) for use in ascertaining the value of an interest in property for estate tax purposes must be used for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(i) in determining a beneficiary's actuarial interest in stock owned directly or indirectly by or for a trust.
(ii) For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), property of a decedent is
considered as owned by the decedent's estate if such property is subject to administration by the executor or administrator for the purposes of paying claims against the estate and expenses of administration notwithstanding that, under local law, legal title to such property vests in the decedent's heirs, legatees or devisees immediately upon death. With respect to an estate, the term
beneficiary
includes any person entitled to receive property of the decedent pursuant to a will or pursuant to laws of descent and distribution. A person no longer is considered a beneficiary of an estate when all the property to which the person is entitled has been received by the person, when the person no longer has a claim against the estate arising out of having been a beneficiary, and when there is only a remote possibility that it will be necessary for the estate to seek the return of property or to seek payment from the person by contribution or otherwise to satisfy claims against the estate or expenses of administration. When pursuant to the preceding sentence, a person ceases to be a beneficiary, stock owned by the estate is not thereafter considered owned by the person.
(iii) Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any portion of a trust of which a person is considered the owner under Subpart E, Part I, Subchapter J of the Code (relating to grantors and others treated as substantial owners) is considered as owned by such person.
(iv) This subparagraph does not apply to stock owned by any employees' trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a).
(4)
Attribution from corporations.
(i) Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a corporation shall be considered as owned by any person who owns (within the meaning of section 1563(d)) 5 percent or more in value or its stock in that proportion which the value of the stock which such person so owns bears to the value of all the stock in such corporation.
(ii)
Example.
Brown, an individual, owns 60 shares of the 100 shares of the only class of outstanding stock of corporation P. Smith, an individual, owns 4 shares of the P stock, and corporation X owns 36 shares of the P stock. Corporation P owns, directly and indirectly, 50 shares of the stock of corporation S. Under this paragraph (b)(4), Brown is considered to own 30 shares of the S stock (60/100 × 50), and X is considered to own 18 shares of the S stock (36/100 × 50). Since Smith does not own 5 percent or more in value of the P stock, Smith is not considered as owning any of the S stock owned by P. If, in this example, Smith's spouse had owned directly 1 share of the P stock, Smith (and Smith's spouse) would each own 5 shares of the P stock, and therefore Smith (and Smith's spouse) would be considered as owning 2.5 shares of the S stock (5/100 × 50).
(5)
Spouse.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, an individual is considered to own the stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for the individual's spouse, other than a spouse who is legally separated from the individual under a decree of divorce, whether interlocutory or final, or a decree of separate maintenance.
(ii) An individual is not considered to own stock in a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by or for the individual's spouse on any day of a taxable year of such corporation, provided that each of the following conditions are satisfied with respect to such taxable year:
(A) Such individual does not, at any time during such taxable year, own directly any stock in such corporation.
(B) Such individual is not a member of the board of directors or an employee of such corporation and does not participate in the management of such corporation at any time during such taxable year.
(C) Not more than 50 percent of such corporation's gross income for such taxable year was derived from royalties, rents, dividends, interest, and annuities.
(D) Such stock in such corporation is not, at any time during such taxable year, subject to conditions which substantially restrict or limit the spouse's right to dispose of such stock and which run in favor of the individual or the individual's children who have not
attained the age of 21 years. The principles of § 1.1563-2(b)(2)(iii) apply in determining whether a condition is a condition described in the preceding sentence.
(iii) For purposes of subdivision (ii)(
c
) of this subparagraph, the gross income of a corporation for a taxable year shall be determined under section 61 and the regulations thereunder. The terms “royalties”, “rents”, “dividends”, “interest”, and “annuities” shall have the same meanings such terms are given for purposes of section 1244(c). See paragraph (e)(1)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of § 1.1244(c)-1.
(6)
Children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents.
(i) An individual is considered to own the stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for the individual's children who have not attained the age of 21 years, and, if the individual has not attained the age of 21 years, the stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for the individual's parents.
(ii) If an individual owns (directly, and with the application of the rules of this paragraph but without regard to this paragraph (b)(6)(ii)) stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or more than 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock in a corporation, then such individual is considered to own the stock in such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by or for the individual's parents, grandparents, grandchildren, and children who have attained the age of 21 years. In determining whether the stock owned by an individual possesses the requisite percentage of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of a corporation,
see
§ 1.1563-1(a)(6).
(iii) For purposes of section 1563, and §§ 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, a legally adopted child of an individual shall be treated as a child of such individual by blood.
(iv)
Example
—(A)
Facts.
Individual B owns directly 40 shares of the 100 shares of the only class of stock of Z Corporation. B's child, M (20 years of age), owns directly 30 shares of such stock, and B's child, A (30 years of age), owns directly 20 shares of such stock. The remaining 10 shares of the Z stock are owned by an unrelated person.
(B)
B's ownership.
Individual B owns 40 shares of the Z stock directly and is considered to own the 30 shares of Z stock owned directly by M. Since, for purposes of the more-than-50-percent stock ownership test contained in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, B is treated as owning 70 shares or 70 percent of the total voting power and value of the Z stock, B is also considered as owning the 20 shares owned by B's adult child, A. Accordingly, B is considered as owning a total of 90 shares of the Z stock.
(C)
M's ownership.
Minor child, M, owns 30 shares of the Z stock directly, and is considered to own the 40 shares of Z stock owned directly by B. However, M is not considered to own the 20 shares of Z stock owned directly by M's sibling, A, and constructively by B, because stock constructively owned by B by reason of family attribution is not considered as owned by M for purposes of making another member of B's family the constructive owner of such stock.
See
paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Accordingly, M owns and is considered as owning a total of 70 shares of the Z stock.
(D)
A's ownership.
Adult child, A, owns 20 shares of the Z stock directly. Since, for purposes of the more-than-50-percent stock ownership test contained in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, A is treated as owning only the Z stock which A owns directly, A does not satisfy the condition precedent for the attribution of Z stock from B. Accordingly, A is treated as owning only the 20 shares of Z stock which A owns directly.
(c)
Operating rules and special rules
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, stock constructively owned by a person by reason of the application of subparagraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) of paragraph (b) of this section shall, for purposes of applying such subparagraphs, be treated as actually owned by such person.
(2)
Members of family.
Stock constructively owned by an individual by reason of the application of paragraph
(b)(5) or (6) of this section is not treated as owned by the individual for purposes of again applying such paragraphs in order to make another the constructive owner of such stock.
(3)
Precedence of option attribution.
For purposes of this section, if stock may be considered as owned by a person under subparagraph (1) of paragraph (b) of this section (relating to option attribution) and under any other subparagraph of such paragraph, such stock shall be considered as owned by such person under subparagraph (1) of such paragraph.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples:
(i)
Example 1.
A, 30 years of age, has a 90 percent interest in the capital and profits of a partnership. The partnership owns all the outstanding stock of corporation X and X owns 60 shares of the 100 outstanding shares of corporation Y. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the 60 shares of Y constructively owned by the partnership by reason of paragraph (b)(4) of this section is treated as actually owned by the partnership for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Therefore, A is considered as owning 54 shares of the Y stock (90 percent of 60 shares).
(ii)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section (
Example 1
), except that that B, who is 20 years of age and the sibling of A, directly owns 40 shares of Y stock. Although the stock of Y owned by B is considered as owned by C (the parent of A and B) under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section such stock may not be treated as owned by C for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section in order to make A the constructive owner of such stock.
(iii)
Example 3.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section (
Example 2
), except that that C has an option to acquire the 40 shares of Y stock owned by B. The rule contained in paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not prevent the reattribution of such 40 shares to A because, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, C is considered as owning the 40 shares by reason of option attribution and not by reason of family attribution. Therefore, since A satisfies the more-than-50-percent stock ownership test contained in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section with respect to Y, the 40 shares of Y stock constructively owned by C are reattributed to A, and A is considered as owning a total of 94 shares of Y stock.
(d)
Special rule of section 1563 (f)(3)(B)
—(1)
In general.
If the same stock of a corporation is owned (within the meaning of section 1563(d)) by two or more persons, then such stock shall be treated as owned by the person whose ownership of such stock results in the corporation being a component member of a controlled group on a December 31 which has at least one other component member on such date.
(2)
Component member of more than one group.
(i) If, by reason of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a corporation would (but for this subparagraph) become a component member of more than one controlled group on a December 31, such corporation shall be treated as a component member of only one such controlled group on such date. The determination as to which group such corporation is treated as a component member of shall be made in accordance with the rules contained in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section.
(ii) In any case in which a corporation is a component member of a controlled group of corporations on a December 31 as a result of treating each share of its stock as owned only by the person who owns such share directly, then each such share shall be treated as owned by the person who owns such share directly.
(iii) If the application of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph does not result in a corporation being treated as a component member of only one controlled group on a December 31, then the stock of such corporation described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be treated as owned by the one person described in such subparagraph who owns, directly and with the application of the rules contained in paragraph (b) (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, the stock possessing the greatest percentage of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of the corporation.
(iv)
Statement.
If the application of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section does not result in a corporation being treated as a component member of only one controlled group of corporations on a December 31, then such corporation will be treated as a component member of only one such group on such date. Such corporation may elect the group in which it is to be included by including on or with its income tax return a statement entitled, “STATEMENT TO ELECT CONTROLLED GROUP PURSUANT TO § 1.1563-3(d)(2)(iv).” The statement must include—
(A) A description of each of the controlled groups in which the corporation could be included. The description must include the name and employer identification number of each component member of each such group and the stock ownership of the component members of each such group; and
(B) The following representation: [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF CORPORATION] ELECTS TO BE TREATED AS A COMPONENT MEMBER OF THE [INSERT DESIGNATION OF GROUP].
(v)
Election
—(A)
Election filed.
An election filed under paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section is irrevocable and effective until paragraph (d)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section applies or until a change in the stock ownership of the corporation results in termination of membership in the controlled group in which such corporation has been included.
(B)
Election not filed.
In the event no election is filed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, then the Internal Revenue Service will determine the group in which such corporation is to be included. Such determination will be binding for all subsequent years unless the corporation files a valid election with respect to any such subsequent year or until a change in the stock ownership of the corporation results in termination of membership in the controlled group in which such corporation has been included.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (d) may be illustrated by the following examples, in which each corporation referred to uses the calendar year as its taxable year and the stated facts are assumed to exist on each day of 1970 (unless otherwise provided in the example):
(i)
Example 1.
Jones owns all the stock of corporation X and has an option to purchase from Smith all the outstanding stock of corporation Y. Smith owns all the outstanding stock of corporation Z. Since the Y stock is considered as owned by two or more persons, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the Y stock is treated as owned only by Smith since Smith has direct ownership of such stock. Therefore, on December 31, 1970, Y and Z are component members of the same brother-sister controlled group. If, however, Smith had owned Smith's stock in corporation Z for less than one-half of the number of days of Z's 1970 taxable year, then under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Y stock would be treated as owned only by Jones since Jones's ownership results in Y being a component member of a controlled group on December 31,1970.
(ii)
Example 2.
Individual A owns directly all the outstanding stock of corporation M. B (the spouse of A) owns directly all the outstanding stock of corporation N. Neither spouse is considered as owning the stock directly owned by the other because each of the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section is satisfied with respect to each corporation's 1970 taxable year. A owns directly 60 percent of the only class of stock of corporation P and B owns the remaining 40 percent of the P stock. Under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the stock of P is treated as owned only by A since A owns (directly and with the application of the rules contained in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section) the stock possessing the greatest percentage of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of P. Accordingly, on December 31, 1970, P is treated as a component member of a brother-sister group consisting of M and P.
(iii)
Example 3.
Unrelated individuals A and B each own 49 percent of all the outstanding stock of corporation R, which in turn owns 70 percent of the only class of outstanding stock of corporation S. The remaining 30 percent of the stock of corporation S is owned by unrelated individual C. C also owns the
remaining 2 percent of the stock of corporation R. Under the attribution rule of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, A and B are each considered to own 34.3 percent of the stock of corporation S. Accordingly, since five or fewer persons own at least 80 percent of the stock of corporations R and S and also own more than 50 percent identically (A's and B's identical ownership each is 34.3 percent, C's identical ownership is 2 percent), on December 31, 1970, corporations R and S are treated as component members of the same brother-sister controlled group for purposes of § 1.1563-1(a)(3)(ii).
(e)
Applicability dates.
This section applies to taxable years beginning on or after December 30, 2024. For taxable years beginning before December 30, 2024,

§ 1.1563-4
Franchised corporations.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(
d
) of § 1.1563-1, a member of a controlled group of corporations shall be considered to be a franchised corporation for a taxable year if each of the following conditions is satisfied for one-half (or more) of the number of days preceding the December 31 included within such taxable year (or, if such taxable year does not include a December 31, for one-half or more of the number of days in such taxable year preceding the last day of such year):
(1) Such member is franchised to sell the products of another member, or the common owner, of such controlled group.
(2) More than 50 percent (determined on the basis of cost) of all the goods held by such member primarily for sale to its customers are acquired from members or the common owner of the controlled group, or both.
(3) The stock of such member is to be sold to an employee (or employees) of such member pursuant to a bona fide plan designed to eliminate the stock ownership of the parent corporation (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.1563-2) or of the common owner (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.1563-2) in such member.
(4) Such employee owns (or such employees in the aggregate own) directly more than 20 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of such member. For purposes of this subparagraph, the determination of whether an employee (or employees) owns the requisite percentage of the total value of the stock of the member shall be made without regard to paragraph (b) of § 1.1563-2, relating to certain stock treated as excluded stock. Furthermore, if the corporation has more than one class of stock outstanding, the relative voting rights as between each such class of stock shall be disregarded in making such determination.
(b)
Plan for elimination of stock ownership.
(1) A plan referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section must:
(i) Provide a reasonable selling price for the stock of the member, and
(ii) Require that a portion of the employee's compensation or dividends, or both, from such member be applied to the purchase of such stock (or to the purchase of notes, bonds, debentures, or similar evidences of indebtedness of such member held by the parent corporation or the common owner).
It is not necessary, in order to satisfy the requirements of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, that the plan require that a percentage of every dollar of the compensation and dividends be applied to the purchase of the stock (or the indebtedness). The requirements of such subdivision are satisfied if an otherwise qualified plan provides that under certain specified conditions (such as a requirement that the member earn a specified profit) no portion of the compensation and/or dividends need be applied to the purchase of the stock (or indebtedness), provided such conditions are reasonable.
(2) A plan for the elimination of the stock ownership of the parent corporation or of the common owner will satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph even though it does not require that the stock of the
member be sold to an employee (or employees) if it provides for the redemption of the stock of the member held by the parent or common owner and under the plan the amount of such stock to be redeemed during any period is calculated by reference to the profits of such member during such period.

§ 1.5000A-1
Maintenance of minimum essential coverage and liability for the shared responsibility payment.
(a)
In general.
For each month during the taxable year, a nonexempt individual must have minimum essential coverage or pay the shared responsibility payment. For a month, a nonexempt individual is an individual in existence for the entire month who is not an exempt individual described in § 1.5000A-3.
(b)
Coverage under minimum essential coverage
—(1)
In general.
An individual has minimum essential coverage for a month in which the individual is enrolled in and entitled to receive benefits under a program or plan identified as minimum essential coverage in § 1.5000A-2 for at least one day in the month.
(2)
Special rule for United States citizens or residents residing outside the United States or residents of territories.
An individual is treated as having minimum essential coverage for a month—
(i) If the month occurs during any period described in section 911(d)(1)(A) or section 911(d)(1)(B) that is applicable to the individual; or
(ii) If, for the month, the individual is a bona fide resident of a possession of the United States (as determined under section 937(a)).
(c)
Liability for shared responsibility payment
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer is liable for the shared responsibility payment for a month for which—
(i) The taxpayer is a nonexempt individual without minimum essential coverage; or
(ii) A nonexempt individual for whom the taxpayer is liable under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section does not have minimum essential coverage.
(2)
Liability for dependents
—(i)
In general.
For a month when a nonexempt individual does not have minimum essential coverage, if the nonexempt individual is a dependent (as defined in section 152) of another individual for the other individual's taxable year including that month, the other individual is liable for the shared responsibility payment attributable to the dependent's lack of coverage. An individual is a dependent of a taxpayer for a taxable year if the individual satisfies the definition of dependent under section 152, regardless of whether the taxpayer claims the individual as a dependent on a Federal income tax return for the taxable year. If an individual may be claimed as a dependent by more than one taxpayer in the same calendar year, the taxpayer who properly claims the individual as a dependent for the taxable year is liable for the shared responsibility payment attributable to the individual. If more than one taxpayer may claim an individual as a dependent in the same calendar year but no one claims the individual as a dependent, the taxpayer with priority under the rules of section 152 to claim the individual as a dependent is liable for the shared responsibility payment for the individual.
(ii)
Special rules for dependents adopted or placed in foster care during the taxable year
—(A)
Taxpayers adopting an individual.
If a taxpayer adopts a nonexempt dependent (or accepts a nonexempt dependent who is an eligible foster child as defined in section 152(f)(1)(C)) during the taxable year and is otherwise liable for the nonexempt dependent under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the taxpayer is liable under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section for the nonexempt dependent only for the full months in the taxable year that follow the month in which the adoption or acceptance occurs.
(B)
Taxpayers placing an individual for adoption.
If a taxpayer who is otherwise liable for a nonexempt dependent under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section places (or, by operation of law, must place) the nonexempt dependent for adoption or foster care during the taxable year, the taxpayer is liable under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section for the nonexempt dependent only for the full months in the taxable year that precede the month in which the adoption or foster care placement occurs.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii). In each example the taxpayer's taxable year is a calendar year.

# Example 1. Taxpayers adopting a child.
(i) E and F, married individuals filing a joint return, initiate proceedings for the legal adoption of a 2-year old child, G, in January 2016. On May 15, 2016, G becomes the adopted child (within the meaning of section 152(f)(1)(B)) of E and F, and resides with them for the remainder of 2016. Prior to the adoption, G resides with H, an unmarried individual, with H providing all of G's support. For 2016 G meets all requirements under section 152 to be E and F's dependent, and not H's dependent.
(ii) Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, E and F are not liable for a shared responsibility payment attributable to G for January through May of 2016, but are liable for a shared responsibility payment attributable to G, if any, for June through December of 2016. H is not liable for a shared responsibility payment attributable to G for any month in 2016, because G is not H's dependent for 2016 under section 152.

# Example 2. Taxpayers placing a child for adoption.
(i) The facts are the same as
Example 1,
except the legal adoption occurs on August 15, 2016, and, for 2016, G meets all requirements under section 152 to be H's dependent, and not E and F's dependent.
(ii) Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, H is liable for a shared responsibility payment attributable to G, if any, for January through July of 2016, but is not liable for a shared responsibility payment attributable to G for August through December of 2016. E and F are not liable for a shared responsibility payment attributable to G for any month in 2016, because G is not E and F's dependent for 2016 under section 152.
(3)
Liability of individuals filing a joint return.
Married individuals (within the meaning of section 7703) who file a joint return for a taxable year are jointly liable for any shared responsibility payment for a month included in the taxable year.

A former employee or an individual related to a former employee, who may enroll in continuation coverage required under Federal law or a state law that provides comparable continuation coverage, or in retiree coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan, is eligible for coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan only if the individual enrolls in the coverage.
(ii)
Required contribution for individuals eligible for coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan
—(A)
Employees.
In the case of an employee who is eligible to purchase coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan sponsored by the employee's employer, the required contribution is the portion of the annual premium that the employee would pay (whether through salary reduction or otherwise) for the lowest cost self-only coverage.
(B)
Individuals related to employees.
In the case of an individual who is eligible for coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan because of a relationship to an employee and for whom a personal exemption deduction under section 151 is claimed on the employee's Federal income tax return (related individual), the required contribution is the portion of the annual premium that the employee would pay (whether through salary reduction or otherwise) for the lowest cost family coverage that would cover the employee and all related individuals who are included in the employee's family and are not otherwise exempt under § 1.5000A-3.
(C)
Required contribution for part-year period.
For each individual described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) or (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, affordability under this paragraph (e)(3) is determined separately for each employment period that is less than a full calendar year or for the portions of an employer's plan year that fall in different taxable years of the individual. Coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan is affordable for a part-year period if the annualized required contribution for self-only coverage (in the case of the employee) or family coverage (in the case of a related individual) under the plan for the part-year period does not exceed the required contribution percentage of the individual's household income for the taxable year. The annualized required contribution is the required contribution determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) or (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section for the part-year period times a fraction, the numerator of which is 12 and the denominator of which is the number of months in the part-year period during the individual's taxable year. Only full calendar months are included in the computation under this paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C).
(D)
Employer contributions to health reimbursement arrangements.
Amounts newly made available for the current plan year under a health reimbursement arrangement that an employee may use to pay premiums, or may use to pay cost-sharing or benefits not covered by the primary plan in addition to premiums, are counted toward the employee's required contribution if the health reimbursement arrangement would be integrated, as that term is used in Notice 2013-54 (2013-40 IRB 287) or in any successor published guidance (see § 601.601(d) of this chapter), with an eligible employer-sponsored plan for an employee enrolled in the plan. The eligible employer-sponsored plan and the health reimbursement arrangement must be offered by the same employer. Employer contributions to a health reimbursement arrangement count toward an employee's required contribution only to the extent the amount of the annual contribution is required under the terms of the plan or otherwise determinable within a reasonable time before the employee must decide whether to enroll in the eligible employer-sponsored plan.
(E)
Employer contributions to cafeteria plans.
Amounts made available for the current plan year under a cafeteria plan, within the meaning of section 125, are taken into account in determining an employee's or a related individual's required contribution if:
(
1
) The employee may not opt to receive the amount as a taxable benefit;
(
2
) The employee may use the amount to pay for minimum essential coverage; and
(
3
) The employee may use the amount exclusively to pay for medical care, within the meaning of section 213.
(F)
Wellness program incentives.
Nondiscriminatory wellness program incentives, within the meaning of § 54.9802-1(f) of this chapter, offered by an eligible employer-sponsored plan that affect premiums are treated as earned in determining an employee's required contribution for purposes of affordability of an eligible employer-sponsored plan to the extent the incentives relate exclusively to tobacco use. Wellness program incentives that do
not relate to tobacco use or that include a component unrelated to tobacco use are treated as not earned for this purpose. For purposes of this section, the term
wellness program incentive
has the same meaning as the term
reward
in
§
54.9802-1(f)(1)(i) of this chapter.
(G)
Opt-out arrangements.

(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(3). Unless stated otherwise, in each example, each individual's taxable year is a calendar year, the individual is ineligible for any other exemptions described in this section for a month, the rate of premium growth has not exceeded the rate of income growth since 2013, and the individual's employer offers a single plan that uses a calendar plan year and is an eligible employer-sponsored plan as described in § 1.5000A-2(c).

# Example 1. Unmarried employee with no dependents.
Taxpayer A is an unmarried individual with no dependents. In November 2015, A is eligible to enroll in self-only coverage under a plan offered by A's employer for calendar year 2016. If A enrolls in the coverage, A is required to pay $5,000 of the total annual premium. In 2016, A's household income is $60,000. Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, A's required contribution is $5,000, the portion of the annual premium A pays for self-only coverage. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, A lacks affordable coverage for 2016 because A's required contribution ($5,000) is greater than 8% of A's household income ($4,800).

# Example 2. Married employee with dependents.
Taxpayers B and C are married and file a joint return for 2016. B and C have two children, D and E. In November 2015, B is eligible to enroll in self-only coverage under a plan offered by B's employer for calendar year 2016 at a cost of $5,000 to B. C, D, and E are eligible to enroll in family coverage under the same plan for 2016 at a cost of $20,000 to B. B, C, D, and E's household income for 2016 is $90,000. Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, B's required contribution is B's share of the cost for self-only coverage, $5,000. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, B has affordable coverage for 2016 because B's required contribution ($5,000) does not exceed 8% of B's household income ($7,200). Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the required contribution for C, D, and E is B's share of the cost for family coverage, $20,000. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, C, D, and E lack affordable coverage for 2016 because their required contribution ($20,000) exceeds 8% of their household income ($7,200).

# Example 3. Plan year is a fiscal year.
(i) Taxpayer F is an unmarried individual with no dependents. In June 2015, F is eligible to enroll in self-only coverage under a plan offered by F's employer for the period July 2015 through June 2016 at a cost to F of $4,750. In June 2016, F is eligible to enroll in self-only coverage under a plan offered by F's employer for the period July 2016 through June 2017 at a cost to F of $5,000. In 2016, F's household income is $60,000.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, F's annualized required contribution for the period January 2016 through June 2016 is $4,750 ($2,375 paid for premiums in 2016 × 12/6). Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, F has affordable coverage for January 2016 through June 2016 because F's annualized required contribution ($4,750) does not exceed 8% of F's household income ($4,800).
(iii) Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, F's annualized required contribution for the period July 2016 to December 2016 is $5,000 ($2,500 paid for premiums in 2016 × 12/6). Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, F lacks affordable coverage for July 2016 through December 2016 because F's annualized required contribution ($5,000) exceeds 8% of F's household income ($4,800).

# Example 4. Eligibility for coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan and under government sponsored coverage.
Taxpayer G is unmarried and has one child, H. In November 2015, H is eligible to enroll in family coverage under a plan offered by G's employer for 2016. H is also eligible to enroll in the CHIP program for 2016. Under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, H is treated as eligible for coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan for each month in 2016, notwithstanding that H is eligible to enroll in government sponsored coverage for the same period.
(4)
Individuals ineligible for coverage under eligible employer-sponsored plans
—(i)
Eligibility for coverage other than an eligible employer-sponsored plan.
An individual is treated as ineligible for coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan for a month that is not described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.
(ii)
Required contribution for individuals ineligible for coverage under eligible employer-sponsored plans
—(A)
In general.
In the case of an individual who is ineligible for coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan, the required contribution is the premium for the applicable plan, reduced by the maximum amount of any credit allowable under section 36B for the taxable
year, determined as if the individual was covered for the entire taxable year by a qualified health plan offered through the Exchange serving the rating area where the individual resides.
(B)
Applicable plan
—(
1
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section,
applicable plan
means the single lowest cost bronze plan available in the individual market through the Exchange serving the rating area in which the individual resides (without regard to whether the individual purchased a qualified health plan through the Exchange) that would cover all individuals in the individual's nonexempt family. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), an individual's
nonexempt family
means the family (as defined in § 1.5000A-1(d)(4)) that includes the individual, excluding any family members who are otherwise exempt under section 1.5000A-3 or are treated as eligible for coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. The premium for the applicable plan takes into account rating factors (for example, an individual's age or tobacco use) that an Exchange would use to determine the cost of coverage.
(

)
Lowest cost bronze plan does not cover all individuals included in the taxpayer's nonexempt family
—(
i
)
In general.
If the Exchange serving the rating area where the individual resides does not offer a single bronze plan covering all individuals included in the individual's nonexempt family, the premium for the applicable plan is the sum of the premiums for the lowest cost bronze plans that are offered through the Exchanges serving the rating areas where one or more of the individuals reside that would cover in the aggregate all the individuals in the individual's nonexempt family. For instance, coverage offered through the Exchange in a rating area might not cover a family member living in different rating area or a single policy might not cover all the members in a taxpayer's household.

Credit allowable under section 36B.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section,
maximum amount of any credit allowable under section 36B
means the maximum amount of the credit that would be allowable to the individual, or to the taxpayer who can properly claim the individual as a dependent, under section 36B if all members of the individual's nonexempt family enrolled in a qualified health plan through the Exchange serving the rating area where the individual resides.
(E)
Required contribution for part-year period.
For each individual, affordability under paragraph (e)(4) of this section is determined separately for each period described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(E) of this section that is less than a 12-month period. Coverage under a plan is affordable for a part-year period if the annualized required contribution for coverage under the plan for the part-year period does not exceed the required contribution percentage of the individual's household income for the taxable year. The annualized required contribution is the required contribution determined under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for the part-year period times a fraction, the numerator of which is 12 and the denominator of which is the number of months in the part-year period during the individual's taxable year. Only full calendar months are included in the computation under this paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(D).
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (e)(4). Unless stated otherwise, in each example the taxpayer's taxable year is a calendar year, the rate of premium growth has not exceeded the rate of income growth since 2013, and the taxpayer is ineligible for any of the exemptions described in paragraphs (a) through (d) and (f) through (j) of this section for a month.

# Example 1. Unmarried individual with no dependents.
(i) Taxpayer G is an unmarried individual with no dependents. G is ineligible to enroll in any minimum essential coverage other than coverage in the individual market for all months in 2016. The annual premium for the lowest cost bronze self-only plan in G's rating area (G's applicable plan) is $5,000. The adjusted annual premium for the second lowest cost silver self-only plan in G's rating area (G's applicable benchmark plan within the meaning of § 1.36B-3(f)) is $5,500. In 2016 G's household income is $40,000, which is
358% of the Federal poverty line for G's family size for the taxable year.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, the credit allowable under section 36B is determined pursuant to section 36B. With household income at 358% of the Federal poverty line, G's applicable percentage is 9.5. Because each month in 2016 is a coverage month (within the meaning of § 1.36B-3(c)), G's maximum credit allowable under section 36B is the excess of G's premium for the applicable benchmark plan over the product of G's household income and G's applicable percentage ($1,700). Therefore, under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, G's required contribution is $3,300. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, G lacks affordable coverage for 2016 because G's required contribution ($3,300) exceeds 8% of G's household income ($3,200).

# Example 2. Family.
(i) In 2016 Taxpayers M and N are married and file a joint return. M and N have two children, P and Q. M, N, P, and Q are ineligible to enroll in minimum essential coverage other than coverage in the individual market for a month in 2016. The annual premium for M, N, P, and Q's applicable plan is $20,000. The adjusted annual premium for M, N, P, and Q's applicable benchmark plan (within the meaning of § 1.36B-3(f)) is $25,000. M and N's household income is $80,000, which is 347% of the Federal poverty line for a family size of 4 for the taxable year.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, the credit allowable under section 36B is determined pursuant to section 36B. With household income at 347% of the Federal poverty line, the applicable percentage is 9.5. Because each month in 2016 is a coverage month (within the meaning of § 1.36B-3(c)), the maximum credit allowable under section 36B is the excess of the premium for the applicable benchmark plan over the product of the household income and the applicable percentage ($17,400). Therefore, under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the required contribution for M, N, P, and Q is $2,600. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, M, N, P, and Q have affordable coverage for 2016 because their required contribution ($2,600) does not exceed 8% of their household income ($6,400).

# Example 3. Family with some members eligible for government-sponsored coverage.
(i) In 2016 Taxpayers U and V are married and file a joint return. U and V have two children, W and X. U and V are ineligible to enroll in minimum essential coverage other than coverage in the individual market for all months in 2016; however, W and X are eligible for coverage under CHIP for 2016. The annual premium for U, V, W, and X's applicable plan is $20,000. The adjusted annual premium for the second lowest cost silver plan that would cover U and V (the applicable benchmark plan within the meaning of § 1.36B-3(f)) is $12,500. U and V's household income is $50,000, which is 217% of the Federal poverty line for a family size of 4 for the taxable year. W and X do not enroll in CHIP coverage.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, the credit allowable under section 36B is determined pursuant to section 36B. With household income at 217% of the Federal poverty line, the applicable percentage is 6.89. Each month in 2016 is a coverage month (within the meaning of § 1.36B-3(c)) for U and V, but no months in 2016 are coverage months for W and X because they are eligible for CHIP coverage. The maximum credit allowable under section 36B is the excess of the premium for the applicable benchmark plan over the product of the household income and the applicable percentage ($9,055). Therefore, under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the required contribution is $10,945. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, U, V, W, and X lack affordable coverage for 2016 because their required contribution ($10,945) exceeds 8% of their household income ($4,000).

# Example 4. Family with some members enrolled in government-sponsored minimum essential coverage.
The facts are the same as
Example 3,
except W and X enroll in CHIP coverage on January 1, 2016. Under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B), U, V, W, and X are members of U and V's nonexempt family for 2016. Therefore, the annual premium for the applicable plan is the same as in
Example 3
($20,000). The maximum credit allowable under section 36B is also the same as in
Example 3
($9,055). Under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the required contribution is $10,945. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, U and V lack affordable coverage for 2016 because their required contribution ($10,945) exceeds 8% of their household income ($4,000).
(f)
Household income below filing threshold
—(1)
In general.
An individual is an exempt individual for any taxable year for which the individual's household income is less than the applicable filing threshold.

(ii)
Certain dependents.
The applicable filing threshold for an individual who is properly claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer is equal to the other taxpayer's applicable filing threshold.
(3)
Manner of claiming the exemption.
A taxpayer is not required to file a Federal income tax return solely to claim the exemption described in this
paragraph (f). If a taxpayer has a household income below the applicable filing threshold and nevertheless files a Federal income tax return, the taxpayer may claim the exemption described in this paragraph (f) on the return.
(g)
Members of Indian tribes.
An individual is an exempt individual for a month that includes a day on which the individual is a member of an Indian tribe. For purposes of this section,

A hardship exemption certification is issued by an Exchange under section 1311(d)(4)(H) of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18031(d)(4)(H)), 45 CFR 155.605(g)(1), (g)(2), (g)(4) and (g)(6), 45 CFR 155.610(i), and 45 CFR 155.615(f), and certifies that an individual has suffered a hardship (as that term is defined in 45 CFR 155.605(g)) affecting the capability to obtain minimum essential coverage.
(3)
Hardship exemption without hardship exemption certification.
An individual may claim an exemption without obtaining a hardship exemption certification described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section for any month that includes a day on which the individual meets the requirements of any hardship for which:
(i) The Secretary of HHS issues guidance of general applicability describing the hardship and indicating that an exemption for such hardship can be claimed on a Federal income tax return pursuant to guidance published by the Secretary; and
(ii) The Secretary issues published guidance of general applicability, see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter, allowing an individual to claim the hardship exemption on a return without obtaining a hardship exemption from an Exchange.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Individuals with certain short coverage gaps
—(1)
In general.
An individual is an exempt individual for a month the last day of which is included in a short coverage gap.
(2)
Short coverage gap
—(i)
In general. Short coverage gap
means a continuous period of less than three months in which the individual is not covered under minimum essential coverage. If the individual does not have minimum essential coverage for a continuous period of three or more months, none of the months included in the continuous period are treated as included in a short coverage gap.
(ii)
Coordination with other exemptions.
For purposes of this paragraph (j), an individual is treated as having minimum essential coverage for a month in which an individual is exempt under any of paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section.
(iii)
More than one short coverage gap during calendar year.
If a calendar year includes more than one short coverage gap, the exemption provided by this paragraph (j) only applies to the earliest short coverage gap.
(3)
Continuous period
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section, the number of months included in a continuous period is determined without regard to the calendar years in which months included in that period occur. For purposes of paragraph (j) of this section, a continuous period begins no earlier than January 1, 2014.
(ii)
Continuous period straddling more than one taxable year.
If an individual does not have minimum essential coverage for a continuous period that begins in one taxable year and ends in the next, for purposes of applying this paragraph (j) to the first taxable year, the months in the second taxable year included in the continuous period are disregarded. For purposes of applying this paragraph (j) to the second taxable year, the months in the first taxable year included in the continuous period are taken into account.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (j). Unless stated otherwise, in each example the taxpayer's taxable
year is a calendar year and the taxpayer is ineligible for any of the exemptions described in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section for a month.

# Example 1. Short coverage gap.
Taxpayer D has minimum essential coverage in 2016 from January 1 through March 2. After March 2, D does not have minimum essential coverage until D enrolls in an eligible employer-sponsored plan effective June 15. Under § 1.5000A-1(b), for purposes of section 5000A, D has minimum essential coverage for January, February, March, and June through December. D's continuous period without coverage is 2 months, April and May. April and May constitute a short coverage gap under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section.

# Example 2. Continuous period of 3 months or more.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except D's coverage is not effective until July 1. D's continuous period without coverage is 3 months, April, May, and June. Under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, April, May, and June are not included in a short coverage gap.

# Example 3. Short coverage gap following exempt period.
Taxpayer E is incarcerated from January 1 through June 2. E enrolls in an eligible employer-sponsored plan effective September 15. Under paragraph (d) of this section, E is exempt for the period January through June. Under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, E is treated as having minimum essential coverage for this period, and E's continuous period without minimum essential coverage is 2 months, July and August. July and August constitute a short coverage gap under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section.

# Example 4. Continuous period covering more than one taxable year.
Taxpayer F, an unmarried individual with no dependents, has minimum essential coverage for the period January 1 through October 15, 2016. F is without coverage until February 15, 2017. F files his Federal income tax return for 2016 on March 10, 2017. Under paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section, November and December of 2016 are treated as a short coverage gap. However, November and December of 2016 are included in the continuous period that includes January 2017. The continuous period for 2017 is not less than 3 months and, therefore, January is not a part of a short coverage gap.

# Example 5. Enrollment following loss of coverage.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4
except F loses coverage on June 15, 2017. F enrolls in minimum essential coverage effective September 15, 2017. The continuous period without minimum essential coverage in July and August of 2017 is two months and, therefore, is a short coverage gap. Because January 2017 was not part of a short coverage gap, the earliest short coverage gap occurring in 2017 is the gap that includes July and August.

# Example 6. Multiple coverage gaps.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 5
except F has minimum essential coverage for November 2016. Under paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section, December 2016 is treated as a short coverage gap.
(ii) December 2016 is included in the continuous period that includes January 2017. This continuous period is two months and, therefore, January 2017 is the earliest month in 2017 that is included in a short coverage gap. Under paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, the exemption under this paragraph (j) applies only to January 2017. Thus, the continuous period without minimum essential coverage in July and August of 2017 is not a short coverage gap.

§ 1.5000A-4
Computation of shared responsibility payment.
(a)
In general.
For each taxable year, the shared responsibility payment imposed on a taxpayer in accordance with § 1.5000A-1(c) is the lesser of—
(1) The sum of the monthly penalty amounts; or
(2) The sum of the monthly national average bronze plan premiums for the shared responsibility family.
(b)
Monthly penalty amount
—(1)
In general. Monthly penalty amount
means, for a month that a nonexempt individual is not covered under minimum essential coverage, 1/12 multiplied by the greater of—
(i) The flat dollar amount; or
(ii) The excess income amount.
(2)
Flat dollar amount
—(i)
In general. Flat dollar amount
means the lesser of—
(A) The sum of the applicable dollar amounts for all individuals included in the taxpayer's shared responsibility family; or
(B) 300 percent of the applicable dollar amount (determined without regard to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section) for the calendar year with or within which the taxable year ends.
(ii)
Applicable dollar amount.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the applicable dollar amount is—
(A) $95 in 2014;
(B) $325 in 2015; or
(C) $695 in 2016.
(iii)
Special applicable dollar amount for individuals under age 18.
If an individual has not attained the age of 18 before the first day of a month, the applicable dollar amount for the individual is equal to one-half of the applicable dollar amount (as expressed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) for the calendar year in which the month occurs. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii), an individual attains the age of 18 on the anniversary of the date when the individual was born. For example, an individual born on March 1, 1999, attains the age of 18 on March 1, 2017.
(iv)
Indexing of applicable dollar amount.
In any calendar year after 2016, the applicable dollar amount is $695 as increased by the product of $695 and the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iv), the cost-of-living adjustment is determined by substituting “calendar year 2015” for “calendar year 1992” in section 1(f)(3)(B). If any increase under this paragraph (b)(2)(iv) is not a multiple of $50, the increase is rounded down to the next lowest multiple of $50.
(3)
Excess income amount
—(i)
In general. Excess income amount
means the product of—
(A) The excess of the taxpayer's household income over the taxpayer's applicable filing threshold (as defined in § 1.5000A-3(f)(2)); and
(B) The income percentage.
(ii)
Income percentage.
For purposes of this section,
income percentage
means—
(A) 1.0 percent for taxable years beginning in 2013;
(B) 1.0 percent for taxable years beginning in 2014;
(C) 2.0 percent for taxable years beginning in 2015; or
(D) 2.5 percent for taxable years beginning after 2015.
(c)
Monthly national average bronze plan premium. Monthly national average bronze plan premium
means, for a month for which a shared responsibility payment is imposed,
1/12
of the annual national average premium for qualified health plans that have a bronze level of coverage, would provide coverage for the taxpayer's shared responsibility family members who do not have minimum essential coverage for the month, and are offered through Exchanges for plan years beginning in the calendar year with or within which the taxable year ends.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. In each example the taxpayer's taxable year is a calendar year and all members of the taxpayer's shared responsibility family are ineligible for any of the exemptions described in § 1.5000A-3 for a month.

# Example 1. Unmarried taxpayer without minimum essential coverage.
(i) In 2016, Taxpayer G is an unmarried individual with no dependents. G does not have minimum essential coverage for any month in 2016. G's household income is $120,000. G's applicable filing threshold is $12,000. The annual national average bronze plan premium for G is $5,000.
(ii) For each month in 2016, under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, G's applicable dollar amount is $695. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, G's flat dollar amount is $695 (the lesser of $695 and $2,085 ($695 × 3)). Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, G's excess income amount is $2,700 (($120,000 − $12,000) × 0.025). Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the monthly penalty amount is $225 (the greater of $58 ($695/12) or $225 ($2,700/12)).
(iii) The sum of the monthly penalty amounts is $2,700 ($225 × 12). The sum of the monthly national average bronze plan premiums is $5,000 ($5,000/12 × 12). Therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, the shared responsibility payment imposed on G for 2016 is $2,700 (the lesser of $2,700 or $5,000).

# Example 2. Part-year coverage.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except G has minimum essential coverage for January through June. The sum of the monthly penalty amounts is $1,350 ($225 × 6). The sum of the monthly national average bronze plan premiums is $2,500 ($5,000/12 × 6). Therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, the shared responsibility payment imposed on G for 2016 is $1,350 (the lesser of $1,350 or $2,500).

# Example 3. Family without minimum essential coverage.
(i) In 2016, Taxpayers H and J are married and file a joint return. H and J have three children: K, age 21, L, age 15, and M, age 10. No member of the family has minimum essential coverage for any month in 2016. H and J's household income is $250,000. H and J's applicable filing threshold is $24,000. The annual national average bronze plan premium for a family of 5 (3 adults, 2 children) is $15,000.
(ii) For each month in 2016, under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the applicable dollar amount is $2,780 (($695 × 3 adults) + (($695/2) × 2 children)). Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the flat dollar
amount is $2,085 (the lesser of $2,780 and $2,085 ($695 × 3)). Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the excess income amount is $5,650 (($250,000−$24,000) × 0.025). Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the monthly penalty amount is $470.83 (the greater of $173.75 ($2,085/12) or $470.83 ($5,650/12)).
(iii) The sum of the monthly penalty amounts is $5,650 ($470.83 × 12). The sum of the monthly national average bronze plan premiums is $15,000 ($15,000/12 × 12). Therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, the shared responsibility payment imposed on H and J for 2016 is $5,650 (the lesser of $5,650 or $15,000).

# Example 4. Change in shared responsibility family during the year.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except J has minimum essential coverage for January through June. The annual national average bronze plan premium for a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 children) is $10,000.
(ii) For the period January through June 2016, under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section the applicable dollar amount is $2,085 (($695 × 2 adults) + (($695/2) × 2 children)). Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the flat dollar amount is $2,085 (the lesser of $2,085 or $2,085 ($695 × 3)).
(iii) For the period July through December 2016, the applicable dollar amount is $2,780 (($695 × 3 adults) + (($695/2) × 2 children)). Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the flat dollar amount is $2,085 (the lesser of $2,780 or $2,085 ($695 × 3)). Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the excess income amount is $5,650 (($250,000−$24,000) × 0.025). Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for January through June the monthly penalty amount is $470.83 (the greater of $173.75 ($2,085/12) or $470.83 ($5,650/12)). The monthly penalty amount for July through December is $470.83 (the greater of $173.75 ($2,085/12) or $470.83 ($5,650/12)).
(iv) The sum of the monthly penalty amounts is $5,650 ($470.83 × 12). The sum of the monthly national average bronze plan premiums is $12,500 ((($10,000/12) × 6) + (($15,000/12) × 6))). Therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, the shared responsibility payment imposed on H and J for 2016 is $5,650 (the lesser of $5,650 or $12,500).

# Example 5. Eighteenth birthday during the year.
(i) In 2016 Taxpayers S and T are married and file a joint return. S and T have one child, U, who turns 18 years old on June 28. S, T, and U do not enroll in, and as a result are not eligible to receive benefits under, affordable employer-sponsored coverage offered by T's employer for 2016. S and T's household income is $60,000. S and T's applicable filing threshold is $24,000. The annual national average bronze plan premium for a family of 3 (2 adults, 1 child) is $11,000.
(ii) For the period January through June 2016, under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the applicable dollar amount is $1,737.50 (($695 × 2 adults) + ($695/2) × 1 child)). Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the flat dollar amount is $1,737.50 (the lesser of $1,737.50 or $2,085 ($695 × 3)).
(iii) For the period July through December 2016, the applicable dollar amount is $2,085 ($695 × 3). Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the flat dollar amount is $2,085 (the lesser of $2,085 or $2,085 ($695 × 3)). Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the excess income amount is $900 (($60,000−$24,000) × 0.025). Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for January through June the monthly penalty amount is $144.79 (the greater of $144.79 ($1,737.50/12) or $75 ($900/12)). The monthly penalty amount for July through December is $173.75 (the greater of $173.75 ($2,085/12) or $75 ($900/12)).
(iv) The sum of the monthly penalty amounts is $1,911.24 (($144.79 × 6) + ($173.75 × 6)). The sum of the monthly national average bronze plan premiums is $11,000 ($11,000/12 × 12). Therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, the shared responsibility payment imposed on S and T for 2016 is $1,911.24 (the lesser of $1,911.24 or $11,000).

§ 1.5000A-5
Administration and procedure.
(a)
In general.
A taxpayer's liability for the shared responsibility payment for a month must be reported on the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the month. The period of limitations for assessing the shared responsibility payment is the same as that prescribed by section 6501 for the taxable year to which the Federal income tax return on which the shared responsibility payment is to be reported relates. The shared responsibility payment is payable upon notice and demand by the Secretary, and except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, is assessed and collected in the same manner as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of chapter 68 of the Internal Revenue Code. The shared responsibility payment is not subject to deficiency procedures of subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code. Interest on this payment accrues in accordance with the rules in section 6601.
(b)
Special rules.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law—
(1)
Waiver of criminal penalties.
In the case of a failure by a taxpayer to timely pay the shared responsibility payment, the taxpayer is not subject to criminal prosecution or penalty for the failure.
(2)
Limitations on liens and levies.
If a taxpayer fails to pay the shared responsibility payment imposed by this section and §§ 1.5000A-1 through 1.5000A-4, the Secretary will not file notice of lien on any property of the taxpayer, or levy on any property of the taxpayer for the failure.
(3)
Authority to offset against overpayment.
Nothing in this section prohibits the Secretary from offsetting any liability for the shared responsibility payment against any overpayment due the taxpayer, in accordance with section 6402(a) and its corresponding regulations.
(c)
Applicability date.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), this section and §§ 1.5000A-1 through 1.5000A-4 apply for months beginning after December 31, 2013. Section 1.5000A-2(b)(2)(ix) applies for months beginning after September 28, 2020.

§ 1.5000C-1
Tax on specified Federal procurement payments.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides definitions and general rules relating to the imposition of, and exemption from, the tax on specified Federal procurement payments under section 5000C. Section 1.5000C-2 provides rules concerning withholding under section 5000C(d)(1), including the steps that must be taken to determine the obligation to withhold and whether an exemption from withholding applies. Section 1.5000C-3 provides the time and manner for depositing the amounts withheld under section 5000C and the related reporting requirements. Section 1.5000C-4 contains the rules that apply to a foreign contracting party that must pay and report the tax under section 5000C when the tax obligation under section 5000C is not fully satisfied by withholding, as well as procedures by which a contracting party may seek a refund when the amount withheld exceeds its tax liability under section 5000C. Section 1.5000C-5 contains an anti-abuse rule. Section 1.5000C-6 contains examples illustrating the principles of §§ 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-4. Finally, § 1.5000C-7 contains the effective/applicability date for §§ 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7.
(b)
Imposition of tax.
Except as otherwise provided, section 5000C imposes on any foreign contracting party a tax equal to 2 percent of the amount of a specified Federal procurement payment. In general, the tax imposed under section 5000C applies to specified Federal procurement payments received pursuant to contracts entered into on and after January 2, 2011. Specified Federal procurement payments received by a nominee or agent on behalf of a contracting party are considered to be received by that contracting party. The tax imposed under section 5000C is to be applied in a manner consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements. Payments for the purchase or lease of land or an interest in land are not subject to the tax imposed under section 5000C.
(c)
Definitions.
Solely for purposes of section 5000C and §§ 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7, the following definitions apply:
(1) The term
acquiring agency
means the U.S. government department, agency, independent establishment, or corporation described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section that is a party to the contract. To the extent that a U.S. government department or agency, other than the acquiring agency, is making the payments pursuant to the contract, that department or agency is also considered to be the acquiring agency.
(2) The term
contract
has the same meaning as provided in 48 CFR 2.101, and thus does not include a grant agreement or a cooperative agreement within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 6304 and 6305, respectively. A contract may include an agreement that is not executed under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), 48 CFR Chapter 1.
(3) The term
contract ratio
refers to the nonexempt amount over the total contract price.
(4) The term
contracting party
means any person that is a party to a contract
with the U.S. government that is entered into on or after January 2, 2011. See § 1.5000C-1(b) for situations involving a nominee or agent.
(5) The term
foreign contracting party
means a contracting party that is a foreign person.
(6) The term
foreign person
means any person other than a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)).
(7) The term
Government of the United States
or
U.S. government
means the executive departments specified in 5 U.S.C. 101, the military departments specified in 5 U.S.C. 102, the independent establishments specified in 5 U.S.C. 104(1), and wholly owned government corporations specified in 31 U.S.C. 9101(3).

(14) The term
Section 5000C Certificate
means a written statement that includes the information described in § 1.5000C-2(d) that the foreign contracting party submits to an acquiring agency for the purposes of demonstrating that the foreign contracting party is eligible for certain exemptions from withholding (in whole or in part) under section 5000C with respect to a contract.

(1)
Simplified acquisitions.
Payments for purchases under the simplified acquisition procedures that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold as described in 48 CFR 2.101.
(2)

(ii) Entered into under the emergency acquisition flexibilities as defined in 48 CFR part 18.
(3)
Certain personal service contracts.
Payments for services provided by, and under contracts with, a single individual in which the payments do not (and will not) exceed on an annual calendar year basis the simplified acquisition threshold as described in 48 CFR 2.101 for all years of the contract. Payments that satisfy this exemption remain exempt if the contract is later renegotiated so that future payments under the contract do not meet this exemption.

(5)
Certain international agreements.
Payments made by the U.S. government pursuant to a contract with a foreign contracting party when the payments are entitled to relief from the tax imposed under section 5000C pursuant to an international agreement with the United States, including relief pursuant to a nondiscrimination provision of a qualified income tax treaty, because the foreign contracting party is entitled to the benefit of that provision.
(6)
Goods manufactured or produced or services provided in the United States.
A payment made pursuant to a contract to the extent that the payment is for goods manufactured or produced or services provided in the United States.
(7)

(e)
Country in which goods are manufactured or produced or services provided
—
(1)
Goods manufactured or produced.
Solely for purposes of section 5000C, goods are manufactured or produced in the country (or countries)—
(i) Where property has been substantially transformed into the goods that are procured pursuant to a contract; or

(2)
Provision of services.
Solely for purposes of section 5000C, services are considered to be provided in the country where the individuals performing the services are physically located when they perform their duties pursuant to the contract.
(3)
Allocation of total contract price to determine the nonexempt amount.
If, pursuant to a contract, goods are manufactured or produced, or services are provided, in multiple countries and only a portion of the goods manufactured or produced, or the services provided, pursuant to the contract are nonexempt goods or nonexempt services, a foreign contracting party may use a reasonable allocation method to determine the nonexempt amount. A reasonable allocation method would include taking into account the proportionate costs (including the cost of labor and raw materials) incurred to manufacture or produce the goods in each country, or taking into account
the proportionate costs incurred to provide the services in each country.
(4)
Reduction or elimination of withholding by an acquiring agency.
For procedures to reduce or eliminate withholding by an acquiring agency based on where goods are manufactured or produced or where services are provided, including as a result of an allocation under this paragraph (e), see § 1.5000C-2(d).
[T.D. 9782, 81 FR 55138, Aug. 18, 2016]
§ 1.5000C-2
Withholding on specified Federal procurement payments.
(a)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, every acquiring agency making a specified Federal procurement payment on which tax is imposed under section 5000C and §§ 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7 must deduct and withhold an amount equal to 2 percent of the payment. For rules relating to the liability of a foreign contracting party with respect to specified Federal procurement payments not fully withheld upon at source, see § 1.5000C-4. An acquiring agency may rely upon any information furnished by a contracting party under this section unless the acquiring agency has reason to know that the information is incorrect or unreliable. An acquiring agency has reason to know that the information is incorrect or unreliable if it has knowledge of relevant facts or statements contained in the submitted information such that a reasonably prudent person in the position of the acquiring agency would know that the information provided is incorrect or unreliable.
(b)
Steps in determining the obligation to withhold under section 5000C.
An acquiring agency generally determines its obligation to withhold under section 5000C according to the steps described in this paragraph (b). See, however, paragraph (e) of this section for situations in which withholding may be increased in the case of underwithholding, or may be decreased in the case of overwithholding.
(1)
Determine whether the payment is pursuant to a contract for goods or services.
The acquiring agency determines whether it is making a payment pursuant to a contract for goods or services. To the extent that the acquiring agency is making a payment for any other purpose, it does not have an obligation to withhold under section 5000C on the payment.
(2)
Determine whether the payment is made pursuant to a contract with a U.S. person.
The acquiring agency determines whether the payment is made pursuant to a contract with a person considered to be a United States person (U.S. person) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If the other contracting party is a U.S. person, the acquiring agency does not have an obligation to withhold under section 5000C on the payment.
(3)
Determine whether the payment is for purchases under the simplified acquisition procedures.
The acquiring agency determines whether the payment is for purchases under the simplified acquisitions procedures that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold as described in 48 CFR 2.101. If it is, the acquiring agency does not have an obligation to withhold under section 5000C on the payment.
(4)
Determine whether the payment is for emergency acquisitions.
The acquiring agency determines whether the payment is made for certain emergency acquisitions within the meaning of § 1.5000C-1(d)(2). If it is, the acquiring agency does not have an obligation to withhold under section 5000C on the payment.
(5)
Determine whether the payment is for personal services under the simplified acquisition threshold.
The acquiring agency determines whether payments for services under contracts with a single individual do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold as described in 48 CFR 2.101 on an annual basis for all years of the contract. If that is the case, the acquiring agency does not have an obligation to withhold under section 5000C on the payment.
(6)
Determine whether the payment is pursuant to a foreign humanitarian assistance contract.
The acquiring agency determines whether the payment is made pursuant to a foreign humanitarian assistance contract described in § 1.5000C-1(d)(4). If it is, the acquiring agency does not have an obligation to withhold under section 5000C on the payment.
(7)
Determine whether the foreign contracting party is entitled to relief pursuant to an international agreement.
If the foreign contracting party submits a Section 5000C Certificate in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section representing that the foreign contracting party is entitled to relief from the tax imposed under section 5000C pursuant to an international agreement with the United States (such as relief pursuant to the nondiscrimination provision of a qualified income tax treaty), the acquiring agency does not have an obligation to withhold under section 5000C on the payment.
(8)
Determine whether the contract is for goods manufactured or produced or services provided in the United States or in a foreign country that is a party to an international procurement agreement.
If the foreign contracting party submits a Section 5000C Certificate in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section that represents that the contract is for goods manufactured or produced or services provided in the United States, or in a foreign country that is a party to an international procurement agreement, the acquiring agency does not have an obligation to withhold. If the Section 5000C Certificate provides that payments under the contract are only partially exempt from withholding under section 5000C, the acquiring agency must withhold to the extent described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section.
(9)
Compute amounts to withhold.
If, after evaluating each step described in this paragraph (b), the acquiring agency determines that it has an obligation to withhold, the acquiring agency computes the amount of withholding by multiplying the amount of the payment by 2 percent, unless the foreign contracting party has provided a Section 5000C Certificate or the payment is only in part for goods or services. In cases in which the Section 5000C Certificate demonstrates that the exemption in Step 8 applies, the acquiring agency generally computes the amount of withholding by multiplying the amount of the payment by the contract ratio provided on the most recent Section 5000C Certificate, the product of which is multiplied by 2 percent. However, in cases in which the exemption in Step 8 applies and the requirements of paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section are met, the acquiring agency computes the amount of withholding based on the payment for the specifically identified items, which may be identified by the contract line item number, or CLIN. In the case in which the payment is only in part for goods or services, the acquiring agency reduces the amount of the payment subject to the tax to the extent it is for something other than goods or services. The acquiring agency withholds the computed amount from the payment.
(10)
Deposit and report amounts withheld.
The acquiring agency deposits and reports the amounts determined in the prior step in accordance with § 1.5000C-3.
(c)
Determining whether the contracting party is a U.S. person
—(1)
In general.
An acquiring agency must rely on the provisions of this paragraph (c) to determine the status of the contracting party as a U.S. person for purposes of withholding under section 5000C.
(2)
Determination based on Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
An acquiring agency must treat a contracting party as a U.S. person if the U.S. government information system (such as the System for Award Management (SAM)) indicates that the contracting party is a corporation (for example, because the name listed in SAM contains the term “Corporation,” “Inc.,” or “Corp.”) and that it has a TIN that begins with two digits other than “98” (a limited liability company or LLC is not treated as a corporation for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)). Further, an acquiring agency must treat a contracting party as a U.S. person if the acquiring agency has access to a U.S. government information system that indicates that the contracting party is an individual with a TIN that begins with a digit other than “9”.
(3)
Determination based on the Form W-9.
An acquiring agency must treat a contracting party as a U.S. person if the person has submitted to it a valid Form W-9, “Request for Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and Certificate” (or valid substitute form described in § 31.3406(h)-3(c)(2) of this
chapter), signed under penalties of perjury.
(4)
Contracting party treated as a foreign contracting party.
If an acquiring agency cannot determine that a contracting party is a U.S. person based on application of paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section, then the contracting party is treated as a foreign contracting party for purposes of this section.
(d)
Withholding when a foreign contracting party submits a Section 5000C Certificate
—(1)
In general.
Unless the acquiring agency has reason to know that the information is incorrect or unreliable, the acquiring agency may rely on a claim that a foreign contracting party is entitled to an exemption (in whole or in part) from withholding on payments pursuant to a contract if the foreign contracting party provides a Section 5000C Certificate to the acquiring agency as prescribed in this paragraph (d). When a Section 5000C Certificate is furnished, the acquiring agency does not withhold, or must reduce the amount of withholding, on payments made to a foreign person if the certificate establishes that the foreign person is wholly or partially exempt from withholding. An acquiring agency may establish a system for a foreign contracting party to electronically furnish a Section 5000C Certificate.
(2)
Exemption for a foreign contracting party entitled to the benefit of relief pursuant to certain international agreements.
An acquiring agency does not withhold on payments pursuant to a contract with a foreign contracting party when the payment is entitled to relief from the tax imposed under section 5000C pursuant to an international agreement, including relief pursuant to a nondiscrimination provision of a qualified income tax treaty, because the foreign contracting party is entitled to the benefit of that agreement and the foreign contracting party has submitted a Section 5000C Certificate that includes all of the information described in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(3)
Exemption when goods are manufactured or produced or services provided in the United States, or in a foreign country that is a party to an international procurement agreement.
An acquiring agency does not withhold on payments pursuant to a contract with a foreign contracting party to the extent that the payments are for goods manufactured or produced or services provided in the United States or in a foreign country that is a party to an international procurement agreement with the United States, provided that the foreign contracting party has submitted a Section 5000C Certificate that includes all of the information described in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (iii) of this section. If the Section 5000C Certificate provides that the payment is only partially exempt from withholding under section 5000C, the acquiring agency must withhold to the extent that the payment is not exempt.
(4)
Information required for Section 5000C Certificate
—(i)
In general.
The Section 5000C Certificate must be signed under penalties of perjury by the foreign contracting party and contain—
(A) The name of the foreign contracting party, country of organization (if applicable), and permanent residence address of the foreign contracting party;
(B) The mailing address of the foreign contracting party (if different than the permanent residence address);
(C) The TIN assigned to the foreign contracting party (if any);
(D) The identifying or reference number on the contract (if known);
(E) The name and address of the acquiring agency;
(F) A statement that the person signing the Section 5000C Certificate is the foreign contracting party listed in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section (or is authorized to sign on behalf of the foreign contracting party);
(G) A statement that the foreign contracting party is not acting as an agent or nominee for another foreign person with respect to the goods manufactured or produced or services provided under the contract;
(H) A statement that the foreign contracting party agrees to pay an amount equal to any tax (including any applicable penalties and interest) due under section 5000C that the acquiring agency does not withhold under section 5000C;
(I) A statement that the foreign contracting party acknowledges and understands the rules in § 1.5000C-4 relating to procedural obligations related to section 5000C; and
(J) A statement that the foreign contracting party has not engaged in a transaction (or series of transactions) with a principal purpose of avoiding the tax imposed under section 5000C as defined in § 1.5000C-5.
(ii)
Additional information required for claiming an exemption based on certain international agreements with the United States.
In addition to the information required by paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, a foreign contracting party claiming an exemption from withholding in reliance on a provision of an international agreement with the United States, including a qualified income tax treaty, must provide—
(A) The name of the international agreement under which the foreign contracting party is claiming benefits;
(B) The specific provision of the international agreement relied upon (for example, the nondiscrimination article of a qualified income tax treaty); and
(C) The basis on which it is entitled to the benefits of that provision (for example, because the foreign contracting party is a corporation organized in a foreign country that has in force a qualified income tax treaty with the United States that covers all nationals, regardless of their residence).
(iii)
Additional required information for claiming exemption based on country where goods are manufactured or services provided.
(A)
In general.
In addition to the information required by paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, a foreign contracting party claiming an exemption from withholding (in whole or in part) because payments will be pursuant to a contract for goods manufactured or produced or services provided in the United States, or a foreign country that is party to an international procurement agreement, must describe on the Section 5000C Certificate the relevant goods or services and the country (or countries) in which they are manufactured or produced, or are provided, and must include the name of the international procurement agreement or agreements (if relevant).
(B)
Information on allocation to exempt and nonexempt amounts.
(
1
)
In general.
In situations in which a foreign contracting party claims the exemption in paragraph (d)(3) of this section with respect to only a portion of the payments received under the contract, the Section 5000C Certificate must include an explanation of the method used by the foreign contracting party to allocate the total contract price among the countries, as described in § 1.5000C-1(e)(3), if applicable. In general, the Section 5000C Certificate also must include the total contract price and the nonexempt amount; however, when necessary, an estimate of the total contract price or the nonexempt amount may be used. For example, total contract price may be estimated when a Section 5000C Certificate is being completed with respect to payments to be made pursuant to a cost-reimbursement contract that is paid on the basis of actual incurred costs and the total amount of such costs is not known at the time the certificate is provided.
(
2
)
Specific identification of exempt items.
If agreed to by the acquiring agency, the Section 5000C Certificate may identify specific exempt and nonexempt amounts. For example, specific contract line items (such as a contract line item number or CLIN) identified in the contract may be listed on the Section 5000C Certificate as exempt and nonexempt amounts (in whole or in part), as applicable. When this paragraph applies, and whether or not the contract identifies exempt and nonexempt amounts, a foreign contracting party must provide the information required by paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(A) and (d)(4)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, on the Section 5000C Certificate to explain why the contract line items are eligible for an exemption; however, the foreign contracting party is not required to include information about the total contract price under this paragraph. In these circumstances, only one Section 5000C Certificate is required to be provided identifying the exempt and nonexempt contract line items that relate to the contract (for example, a spreadsheet may be attached to the Section 5000C Certificate that identifies the
contract line items with an explanation for the treatment as exempt or nonexempt).
(5)
Validity period of Section 5000C Certificate.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the Section 5000C Certificate is valid for the term of the contract.
(6)
Change in circumstances.
A foreign contracting party must submit a revised Section 5000C Certificate within 30 days of a change in circumstances that causes the information in a Section 5000C Certificate held by the acquiring agency to be incorrect with respect to the acquiring agency's determination of whether to withhold or the amount of withholding under Section 5000C. An acquiring agency must request a new Section 5000C Certificate from a contracting party in circumstances in which it knows (or has reason to know) that a previously submitted Section 5000C Certificate becomes incorrect or unreliable. An acquiring agency may request an updated Section 5000C Certificate at any time, including when other documentation is required under the contract, such as the annual representations and certifications required in 48 CFR 4.1201.
See
§ 1.5000C-6,
Example 6,
for an illustration of this paragraph (6).
(7)
Form W-14.
A foreign contracting party may choose to use Form W-14, “Certificate of Foreign Contracting Party Receiving Federal Procurement Payments” (or other form that the IRS may prescribe), as its Section 5000C Certificate, provided that it includes all the necessary information required by this paragraph (d).
(8)
Time for submitting Section 5000C Certificate.
A contracting party must submit the Section 5000C Certificate (such as Form W-14 or Form W-9) as early as practicable (for example, when the offer for the contract is submitted to the U.S. government). In all cases, however, the Section 5000C Certificate must be submitted to the acquiring agency no later than the date of execution of the contract.
(e)
Offset for underwithholding or overwithholding
—(1)
In general.
If the foreign contracting party discovers that amounts withheld on prior payments either were insufficient or in excess of the amount required to satisfy its tax liability under section 5000C, the foreign contracting party may request the acquiring agency to increase or decrease the amount of withholding on future payments for which withholding is required under section 5000C. The request must be in writing, signed under penalties of perjury, contain the amount by which the foreign contracting party requests to increase or decrease future amounts withheld under section 5000C, and explain the reason for the request. The request may be submitted in conjunction with an original or updated Section 5000C Certificate.
(2)
Underwithholding.
Upon receipt of a request described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, acquiring agencies may increase the amount of withholding under this paragraph to correct underwithholding only if the payment for which the increase is applied is otherwise subject to withholding under section 5000C and made before the date that Form 1042, “Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons,” is required to be filed (not including extensions) with respect to the payment for which the underwithholding occurred. Amounts withheld under this paragraph must be deposited and reported in the time and manner as prescribed by § 1.5000C-3.
See
§ 1.5000C-4 for procedures for a foreign contracting party that must pay tax due when its tax liability under section 5000C was not fully satisfied by withholding by an acquiring agency.
(3)
Overwithholding.
Upon receipt of a request described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, acquiring agencies may decrease the amount of withholding on subsequent payments made to the foreign contracting party that are otherwise subject to withholding under section 5000C provided that the payment for which the decrease is applied is made on or before the date on which Form 1042, “Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons,” is required to be filed (not including extensions) with respect to the payment for which the overwithholding occurred.
See
§ 1.5000C-4(e) for procedures for foreign contracting parties to file a claim for refund for the
overwithheld amount under section 5000C.
[T.D. 9782, 81 FR 55138, Aug. 18, 2016]
§ 1.5000C-3
Payment and returns of tax withheld by the acquiring agency.
(a)
In general.
This section provides administrative procedures that acquiring agencies must follow to satisfy their obligations to deposit and report amounts withheld under § 1.5000C-2. An acquiring agency with a section 5000C withholding obligation must increase the amount it deducts and withholds under chapter 3 for fixed or determinable annual or periodical income (FDAP income) by the amount it must withhold under § 1.5000C-2. Accordingly, this section generally applies the administrative provisions of chapter 3 for FDAP income relating to the deposit, payment, and reporting for amounts withheld under § 1.5000C-2, and contains some variation from those provisions to take into account the nature of the tax imposed under section 5000C.
(b)
Deposit rules
—(1)
Acquiring agency with a chapter 3 deposit requirement treats amounts withheld as under chapter 3.
If an acquiring agency has a chapter 3 deposit obligation for a period, it must treat any amount withheld under § 1.5000C-2 as an additional amount of tax withheld under chapter 3 for purposes of the deposit rules of § 1.6302-2. Thus, depending on the combined amount withheld under chapter 3 and § 1.5000C-2, an acquiring agency subject to this paragraph (b)(1) must make monthly deposits, quarter-monthly deposits, or annual deposits under the rules in § 1.6302-2. To the extent provided in forms, instructions, or publications prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), acquiring agencies must deposit all withheld amounts by
electronic funds transfer,
as that term is defined in § 31.6302-1(h)(4)(i) of this chapter.
(2)
Acquiring agency with no chapter 3 filing obligation deposits withheld amounts monthly.
If an acquiring agency has no chapter 3 deposit obligation to which the deposit rules of § 1.6302-2 apply for a calendar month, it must make monthly deposits of the amounts withheld under the rules in this paragraph (b)(2). Thus, an acquiring agency with no chapter 3 deposit obligations and that has withheld any amount under § 1.5000C-2 during any calendar month must deposit that amount by the 15th day of the month following the payment. To the extent provided in forms, instructions, or publications prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), acquiring agencies must deposit all withheld amounts by
electronic funds transfer,
as that term is defined in § 31.6302-1(h)(4)(i) of this chapter.
(c)
Return requirements
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an acquiring agency that withholds an amount pursuant to section 5000C generally must file Form 1042-S, “Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,” and Form 1042, “Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons,” each year, or other such forms as the IRS may prescribe, to report information related to amounts withheld under section 5000C. The acquiring agency must prepare a Form 1042-S for each contracting party reporting the amount withheld under section 5000C for the preceding calendar year. The Form 1042 must show the aggregate amounts withheld under section 5000C that were required to be reported on Forms 1042-S (including those amounts withheld under section 5000C for which a Form 1042-S is not required to be filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section). The Form 1042 must also include the information required by the form and accompanying instructions. Further, any forms required under this paragraph (c) are due at the same time, at the same place, and eligible for the same extended due dates and may be amended in the same manner as Form 1042 and Form 1042-S (or such other forms as the IRS may prescribe related to chapter 3). The acquiring agency must furnish a copy of the Form 1042-S (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe for the same purpose) to the contracting party for whom the form is prepared on or before March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the amount subject to reporting under section 5000C was paid. It must be filed with a transmittal form as provided in the instructions for Form 1042-
S and to the transmittal form. Section 5000C Certificates or other statements or information as prescribed by § 1.5000C-2 that are provided to the acquiring agency are not required to be attached to the Form 1042 filed with the IRS. However, an acquiring agency that is required to file Form 1042 must retain a copy of Form 1042, Form 1042-S, the Section 5000C Certificates, or other statements or information prescribed by § 1.5000C-2 for at least three years from the original due date of Form 1042 or the date it was filed, whichever is later. An acquiring agency that is not required to file Form 1042 must retain any Section 5000C Certificates or other statements or information as prescribed by § 1.5000C-2 for at least three years from the date the Form 1042 would have been due had the acquiring agency had an obligation to file.
(2)
Classified or confidential contracts.
An acquiring agency is not required to report information otherwise required by this section on Form 1042-S for payments made pursuant to classified or confidential contracts (as described in section 6050M(e)(3)), unless the acquiring agency determines that the information reported on the Form 1042-S does not compromise the safeguarding of classified information or national security.
(d)
Special arrangement for certain contracts.
In limited circumstances, the IRS may authorize the amount otherwise required to be withheld under section 5000C to be deposited in the time and manner mutually agreed upon by the acquiring agency and the foreign contracting party. In these circumstances, the IRS may in its sole discretion also modify any reporting or return requirements of the acquiring agency or the foreign contracting party.
[T.D. 9782, 81 FR 55138, Aug. 18, 2016]
§ 1.5000C-4
Requirement for the foreign contracting party to file a return and pay tax, and procedures for the contracting party to seek a refund.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code (“Procedure and Administration”), the tax imposed under section 5000C on foreign persons is treated as a tax imposed under subtitle A. Except as provided elsewhere in the regulations under section 5000C, forms, or accompanying instructions, the tax imposed on foreign contracting parties under section 5000C is administered in a manner similar to gross basis income taxes. This section provides procedures that a foreign contracting party must follow to satisfy its obligations to report and deposit tax due under § 1.5000C-1 as well as procedures for contracting parties to seek a refund of amounts overwithheld.
(b)
Tax obligation of foreign contracting party independent of withholding.
A foreign contracting party subject to tax under section 5000C and §§ 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7 remains liable for the tax unless its tax obligation was fully satisfied by withholding by an acquiring agency in accordance with §§ 1.5000C-2 and 1.5000C-3.
(c)
Return of tax by the foreign contracting party.
If the tax liability under § 1.5000C-1 relating to a payment is not fully satisfied by withholding in accordance with §§ 1.5000C-2 and 1.5000C-3 (including as a result of the use of an estimated nonexempt amount or estimated total contract price in computing the contract ratio), a foreign contracting party subject to tax under § 1.5000C-1 during a calendar year must make a return of tax on, for example, Form 1120-F, “U.S. Income Tax Return of a Foreign Corporation,” or such other form as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may prescribe to report the amount of tax due under section 5000C (required return). A foreign contracting party with no other U.S. tax filing obligation other than with respect to its liability for the tax imposed under section 5000C must file its required return on or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month following the close of its taxable year. The required return must include the information required by the form and accompanying instructions. The required return must be filed at the place and time (including any extension of time to file) provided by the form and accompanying instructions. Penalties for failure to file contained in Subtitle F can apply to foreign contracting parties who fail to file the required return.
A foreign contracting party must attach copies of all Forms 1042-S, “Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,” received from acquiring agencies (if any) to the required return.
(d)
Time and manner of paying tax.
A foreign contracting party must pay the tax imposed under section 5000C in the manner provided and in the time prescribed in the required return and accompanying instructions. In general, the foreign contracting party must pay the tax at the time that the required return is due, excluding extensions. To the extent provided in forms, instructions, or publications prescribed by the IRS, each foreign contracting party must deposit tax due under section 5000C by
electronic funds transfer,
as that term is defined in § 31.6302-1(h)(4)(i) of this chapter. A foreign contracting party that fails to pay tax in the time and manner prescribed in this section (or under forms, instructions, or publications prescribed by the IRS under this section) may be subject to penalties and interest under Subtitle F.
(e)
Refund requests when amount withheld exceeds tax liability.
After taking into account any offsets pursuant to § 1.5000C-2(e)(3), if the acquiring agency has overwithheld amounts under section 5000C and has made a deposit of the amounts under § 1.5000C-3(b), the contracting party may claim a refund of the amount overwithheld pursuant to the procedures described in chapter 65. The contracting party's claim for refund must meet the requirements of section 6402 and the regulations thereunder, as applicable, and must be filed before the expiration of the period of limitations on refund in section 6511 and the regulations thereunder. In general, the contracting party making a refund claim must file the required return to claim a refund, stating the grounds upon which the claim is based. A Section 5000C Certificate and a copy of the Form 1042-S received from the acquiring agency must be attached to the required return. For purposes of this section, an amount is overwithheld if the amount withheld from the payment pursuant to section 5000C and §§ 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7 exceeds the contracting party's tax liability under § 1.5000C-1, regardless of whether the overwithholding was in error or appeared correct when it occurred. A U.S. person may seek a refund under this paragraph (e) even if it was treated as a foreign person under the rules in § 1.5000C-2 (for example, because it neither had a taxpayer identification number on file in the System for Award Management nor submitted Form W-9, “Request for Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and Certification,” to the acquiring agency).
[T.D. 9782, 81 FR 55138, Aug. 18, 2016]
§ 1.5000C-5
Anti-abuse rule.
If a foreign person engages in a transaction (or series of transactions) with a principal purpose of avoiding the tax imposed under section 5000C, the transaction (or series of transactions) may be disregarded or the arrangement may be recharacterized (including disregarding an intermediate entity), in accordance with its substance. If this section applies, the foreign person remains liable for any tax (including any tax obligation unsatisfied as a result of underwithholding) and the Internal Revenue Service retains all other rights and remedies under any applicable law available to collect any tax imposed on the foreign contracting party by section 5000C.
[T.D. 9782, 81 FR 55138, Aug. 18, 2016]
§ 1.5000C-6
Examples.
The rules of §§ 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-4 are illustrated by the following examples. For purposes of the examples: All contracts are executed with acquiring agencies on or after January 2, 2011, and are for the provision of either goods or services; none of the exemptions described in § 1.5000C-1(d) apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated; the acquiring agencies have no other withholding obligations under chapter 3 of the Code and have no other contracts subject to section 5000C; the foreign contracting parties do not have any U.S. source income or a U.S. tax return filing obligation other than a tax return filing obligation that arises based on the facts described in the particular example; and none of the contracts are classified or confidential
contracts as described in section 6050M(e)(3).

# Example 1.
U.S. person not subject to tax; no withholding.
(i)
Facts.
Company A Inc., a domestic corporation and the contracting party, enters into a contract with Agency L, the acquiring agency. Before making its first payment under the contract (for example, on the date of execution of the contract), pursuant to the first step in § 1.5000C-2(b), Agency L determines that the contract will be for services. Under the second step, Agency L reviews Company A Inc.'s record in the System for Award Management (SAM) and determines that Company A is a corporation and is considered to be a U.S. person because Agency L's records demonstrate that Company A Inc. is a business entity treated as a corporation for tax purposes that has a TIN that does not begin with “98.”
(ii)
Analysis.
Company A Inc. is a U.S. person and thus is not subject to the tax under section 5000C. Moreover, because Company A Inc. is a corporation for tax purposes that has a TIN that does not begin with “98,” Agency L is able to determine that it has no obligation to withhold any amounts under section 5000C on the payment made to Company A Inc. For purposes of section 5000C, Company A Inc. could also establish that it is a U.S. person by providing a Form W-9, “Request for Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and Certification,” to Agency L. Company A Inc. does not need to file a Section 5000C Certificate to demonstrate its eligibility for an exemption from withholding.

# Example 2.
Foreign national entitled to the benefit of a nondiscrimination provision of a treaty; no withholding.
(i)
Facts.
Company B, a foreign contracting party and a national of Country T, provides goods to Agency M, the acquiring agency. Company B determines that it is exempt from tax under section 5000C because it is entitled to the benefit of the nondiscrimination article of a qualified income tax treaty between the United States and Country T. Company B submits a Section 5000C Certificate to Agency M when the contract is executed. Company B uses Form W-14, “Certificate of Foreign Contracting Party Receiving Federal Procurement Payments,” and properly fills the relevant sections stating the name of the treaty, the specific article relied upon, and the basis on which it is entitled to the benefits of that article. Following the steps in § 1.5000C-2, Agency M determines that the nondiscrimination provision of the Country T-United States income tax treaty applies to exempt Company B from the tax imposed under section 5000C. Agency M makes one lump sum payment of $50 million to Company B pursuant to the contract.
(ii)
Analysis.
Company B has no liability for tax under section 5000C because it is entitled to the benefit of a nondiscrimination article of a qualified income tax treaty. Because Company B submitted a Section 5000C Certificate meeting the requirements in § 1.5000C-2 and Agency M does not have reason to know that the submitted information is incorrect or unreliable, Agency M is not required to withhold under section 5000C. Agency M must retain the Section 5000C Certificate for at least three years pursuant to § 1.5000C-3(c)(1) from the due date for the Form 1042 (if it were required).

# Example 3.
Foreign treaty beneficiary does not submit Section 5000C Certificate; withholding required.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that Company B does not submit a Section 5000C Certificate to Agency M before Agency M makes the $50 million payment.
(ii)
Analysis.
Company B is not subject to tax under section 5000C, but Agency M must nevertheless withhold on the payment made to Company B because Agency M did not receive a Section 5000C Certificate from Company B in the time and manner required pursuant to § 1.5000C-2(d). Agency M must withhold $1 million (2 percent of $50 million) on the payment, and deposit that amount under the rules in § 1.5000C-3 no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which the payment was made. Agency M must also complete Forms 1042, “Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons,” and 1042-S, “Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,” on or before the date specified on those forms and the accompanying instructions. Agency M must furnish copies of Form 1042-S to Company B. Agency M must retain a copy of the Form 1042 and the Form 1042-S for 3 years from the due date for the Form 1042 pursuant to § 1.5000C-3(c)(1). As Company B is not liable for the tax, it may later file a claim for refund pursuant to the procedures described in chapter 65.

# Example 4.
Foreign contracting party partially exempt from tax under section 5000C when goods are manufactured in different countries.
(i)
Facts.
Company C, a foreign contracting party, provides goods to Agency N in 2015. The terms of the contract require that payment be made to Company C by Agency N in two $5 million installments in 2015. Company C has a TIN that begins with “98” and is not entitled to relief pursuant to an international agreement with the United States, such as relief pursuant to a nondiscrimination provision of a qualified income tax treaty. Some of the goods are manufactured in Country R, which is a party to an international procurement agreement with the United States, with the remainder being manufactured in Country S, a country that is not a party to an international procurement agreement with the United States. Company C uses a reasonable allocation method based on the information available to it at the time in accordance with § 1.5000C-
1(e)(3) to estimate that $3 million is the nonexempt amount that is allocated to the goods produced in Country S. Company C submits a valid and complete Section 5000C Certificate to Agency N in the time and manner required by §§ 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7 that provides that the nonexempt amount is $3 million. In 2015, Agency N pays Company C in two installments pursuant to the terms of the contract.
(ii)
Analysis.
Using a reasonable allocation method to determine the estimated nonexempt amount, Company C determines that pursuant to section 5000C and §§ 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7, tax of $30,000 (2 percent of the $5 million payment, or $100,000 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the estimated nonexempt amount, $3 million, and the denominator of which is the estimated total contract price, or $10 million) is imposed on each payment made to Company C. Because Company C has timely submitted a Section 5000C Certificate explaining the basis for this allocation, Agency N withholds $30,000 on each payment made to Company C. Agency N must deposit each $30,000 withholding tax under the rules in § 1.5000C-3 no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which each payment is made. Agency N must also complete Forms 1042 and 1042-S and furnish copies of Form 1042-S to Company C. Agency N must retain a copy of the Form 1042 and the Form 1042-S for at least three years from the due date for the Form 1042 pursuant to § 1.5000C-3(c)(1). Provided that Agency N properly withholds on the nonexempt portion as required under section 5000C and §§ 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7 and that Company C's estimate of the nonexempt amount is the actual nonexempt amount, Company C does not have an additional tax liability or a U.S. tax return filing obligation as a result of receiving the payments.

# Example 5.
Foreign contracting party liable for additional tax under Section 5000C not fully withheld upon due to errors on the Section 5000C Certificate.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4,
except that the Section 5000C Certificate submitted to Agency N by Company C erroneously provides that the estimated nonexempt amount is $1.5 million instead of $3 million. As a result, Agency N only withholds $15,000 (2 percent of the $5 million payment multiplied by a fraction (the numerator of which is the estimated nonexempt amount stated on the Section 5000C Certificate, $1.5 million, and the denominator of which is the estimated total contract price, or $10 million)) on each payment made to Company C. Agency N neither discovered nor had reason to know that the information on the Section 5000C Certificate was incorrect or unreliable. After both payments have been made and after the filing due date for Form 1042 for 2015, Company C determines that the estimated nonexempt amount should have been stated as $3 million on the Section 5000C Certificate.
(ii)
Analysis.
The tax imposed under section 5000C on Company C as a result of the receipt of specified Federal procurement payments is $60,000 and this amount has not been fully satisfied by withholding by Agency N. Accordingly, Company C must remit additional tax of $30,000 ($60,000 tax liability less $30,000 amounts already withheld by Agency N) and file its required return, a Form 1120-F, “U.S. Income Tax Return of a Foreign Corporation,” for 2015 to report this tax liability, as required by § 1.5000C-4. Company C must explain its corrected allocation method in its Form 1120-F. Company C must also attach a copy of the Form 1042-S it received from Agency N to Form 1120-F.

# Example 6.
Foreign contracting party submits revised Section 5000C Certificate due to change in circumstances.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4,
except that, after the first payment, Company C changes its business so that all of the goods manufactured with respect to the second payment are manufactured in Country R. Prior to the second payment, Company C submits a revised Section 5000C Certificate indicating this change in circumstance pursuant to § 1.5000C-2(d)(6).
(ii)
Analysis.
Agency N withholds $30,000 on the first payment made to Company C and does not withhold on the second payment. Company C does not have an additional tax liability or a U.S. tax return filing obligation as a result of receiving the payments.
[T.D. 9782, 81 FR 55138, Aug. 18, 2016]
§ 1.5000C-7
Effective/applicability date.
Section 5000C applies to specified Federal procurement payments received pursuant to contracts entered into on and after January 2, 2011. Sections 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7 apply on and after November 16, 2016. Contracting parties and acquiring agencies may rely upon the rules in the regulations before such date. If a foreign contracting party fully satisfies its tax and filing obligations under section 5000C with respect to any payments received in tax years ending before November 16, 2016 on or before the later of November 16, 2016 or the due date for the foreign person's income tax return for the year in which the payment was received in a manner consistent with the final regulations, penalties will not be asserted on the foreign contracting parties with respect to those payments or returns.

§ 1.6001-1
Records.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any person subject to tax under subtitle A of the Code (including a qualified State individual income tax which is treated pursuant to section 6361(a) as if it were imposed by chapter 1 of subtitle A), or any person required to file a return of information with respect to income, shall keep such permanent books of account or records, including inventories, as are sufficient to establish the amount of gross income, deductions, credits, or other matters required to be shown by such person in any return of such tax or information.
(b)
Farmers and wage-earners.
Individuals deriving gross income from the business of farming, and individuals whose gross income includes salaries, wages, or similar compensation for personal services rendered, are required with respect to such income to keep such records as will enable the district director to determine the correct amount of income subject to the tax. It is not necessary, however, that with respect to such income individuals keep the books of account or records required by paragraph (a) of this section. For rules with respect to the records to be kept in substantiation of traveling and other business expenses of employees, see § 1.162-17.
(c)
Exempt organizations.
In addition to such permanent books and records as are required by paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the tax imposed by section 511 on unrelated business income of certain exempt organizations, every organization exempt from tax under section 501(a) shall keep such permanent books of account or records, including inventories, as are sufficient to show specifically the items of gross income, receipts and disbursements. Such organizations shall also keep such books and records as are required to substantiate the information required by section 6033. See section 6033 and §§ 1.6033-1 through 1.6033-3.
(d)
Notice by district director requiring returns statements, or the keeping of records.
The district director may require any person, by notice served upon him, to make such returns, render such statements, or keep such specific records as will enable the district director to determine whether or not such person is liable for tax under subtitle A of the Code, including qualified State individual income taxes, which are treated pursuant to section 6361(a) as if they were imposed by chapter 1 of subtitle A.
(e)
Retention of records.

# tax returns or statements
§ 1.6011-1
General requirement of return, statement, or list.
(a)
General rule.
Every person subject to any tax, or required to collect any tax, under Subtitle A of the Code, shall make such returns or statements as are required by the regulations in this chapter. The return or statement shall include therein the information required by the applicable regulations or forms.
(b)
Use of prescribed forms.
Copies of the prescribed return forms will so far as possible be furnished taxpayers by district directors. A taxpayer will not be excused from making a return, however, by the fact that no return form
has been furnished to him. Taxpayers not supplied with the proper forms should make application therefor to the district director in ample time to have their returns prepared, verified, and filed on or before the due date with the internal revenue office where such returns are required to be filed. Each taxpayer should carefully prepare his return and set forth fully and clearly the information required to be included therein. Returns which have not been so prepared will not be accepted as meeting the requirements of the Code. In the absence of a prescribed form, a statement made by a taxpayer disclosing his gross income and the deductions therefrom may be accepted as a tentative return, and, if filed within the prescribed time, the statement so made will relieve the taxpayer from liability for the addition to tax imposed for the delinquent filing of the return, provided that without unnecessary delay such a tentative return is supplemented by a return made on the proper form.
(c)
Tax withheld on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations.
For requirements respecting the return of the tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 of the Code on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations and tax-free covenant bonds, see § 1.1461-2.

§ 1.6011-2
Returns, etc., of DISC's and former DISC's.
(a)
Records and information.
Every DISC and former DISC (as defined in section 992(a)) must comply with section 6001 and the regulations thereunder, relating to required records, statements, and special returns. Thus, for example, a DISC is required to maintain the books of account or records described in § 1.6001-1(a). In addition, every DISC must furnish to each of its shareholders on or before the last day of the second month following the close of the taxable year of the DISC a copy of Schedule K (Form 1120-DISC) disclosing the amounts of actual distributions and deemed distributions from the DISC to such shareholder for the taxable year of the DISC. In the case of a deficiency distribution to meet qualification requirements, see § 1.992-3(a)(4) for requirements that distribution be designated in the form of a communication sent to a shareholder and service center at the time of distribution.
(b)
Returns
—(1)
Requirement of return.
Every DISC (as defined in section 992(a)(1)) shall make a return of income. A former DISC (as defined in section 992(a)(3)) shall also make a return of income in addition to any other return required. The return required of a DISC or former DISC under this section shall be made on Form 1120-DISC. The provisions of § 1.6011-1 shall apply with respect to a DISC and former DISC. A former DISC should indicate clearly on Form 1120-DISC that it is making a return of income as a former DISC (for example, by labeling at the top of the Form 1120-DISC “Former DISC”). In the case of a former DISC, those items on the form which pertain to the computation of taxable income shall not be completed, but Schedules J, K, L, and M must be completed. Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Code or regulations, the return of a DISC or former DISC is considered to be an income tax return.
(2)
Existence of DISC.
A corporation which is a DISC and which is in existence during any portion of a taxable year is required to make a return for that fractional part of its taxable year during which it was in existence.

§ 1.6011-3
Requirement of statement from payees of certain gambling winnings.
(a)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, any person receiving a payment with respect to a wager in a sweepstakes, wagering pool, lottery, or other wagering transaction (including a parimutuel pool with respect to horse races, dog races, or jai alai) shall make a statement to the payer of such winnings upon the payer's demand. Such statements shall accompany the payer's return made with respect to the payment as required pursuant to section 3402(q) or 6041, as the case may be.
(b)
Contents of statement.
The statement referred to in paragraph (a) shall contain information (in addition to
that required under section 6041(c)) as to the amount, if any, of winnings from identical wagers to which the recipient is entitled. If any person other than the recipient is entitled to all or a portion of the payment, the statement shall also include information as to the amount, if any, of winnings from identical wagers to which each such person is entitled. The statement shall be provided on Form W-2G or, if persons other than the recipient are entitled to all or a portion of such payment, on Form 5754.
(c)
Exception.
The requirement of paragraph (a) of this section does not apply with respect to any payment of winnings—
(1) From a slot machine play, or a bingo or keno game,
(2) Which is subject to withholding under section 3402(q) without regard to the existence of winnings from identical wagers, or
(3) For which no return of information under section 6041 is required of the payer.
(d)
Meaning of terms,
For purposes of this section, the terms “sweepstakes”, “wagering pool”, “lottery”, “other wagering transaction” and “identical wagers” shall have the same meanings as ascribed to them under § 31.3402(q)-1.
[T.D. 7919, 48 FR 46297, Oct. 12, 1983]
§ 1.6011-4
Requirement of statement disclosing participation in certain transactions by taxpayers.
(a)
In general.
Every taxpayer that has participated, as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, in a reportable transaction within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section and who is required to file a tax return must file within the time prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section a disclosure statement in the form prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section. The fact that a transaction is a reportable transaction shall not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer's treatment of the transaction is proper.
(b)
Reportable transactions
—(1)
In general.
A reportable transaction is a transaction described in any of the paragraphs (b)(2) through (7) of this section. The term transaction includes all of the factual elements relevant to the expected tax treatment of any investment, entity, plan, or arrangement, and includes any series of steps carried out as part of a plan.
(2)
Listed transactions.
A listed transaction is a transaction that is the same as or substantially similar to one of the types of transactions that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction and identified by notice, regulation, or other form of published guidance as a listed transaction.
(3)
Confidential transactions
—(i)
In general.
A confidential transaction is a transaction that is offered to a taxpayer under conditions of confidentiality and for which the taxpayer has paid an advisor a minimum fee.
(ii)
Conditions of confidentiality.
A transaction is considered to be offered to a taxpayer under conditions of confidentiality if the advisor who is paid the minimum fee places a limitation on disclosure by the taxpayer of the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction and the limitation on disclosure protects the confidentiality of that advisor's tax strategies. A transaction is treated as confidential even if the conditions of confidentiality are not legally binding on the taxpayer. A claim that a transaction is proprietary or exclusive is not treated as a limitation on disclosure if the advisor confirms to the taxpayer that there is no limitation on disclosure of the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction.
(iii)
Minimum fee.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), the minimum fee is—
(A) $250,000 for a transaction if the taxpayer is a corporation;
(B) $50,000 for all other transactions unless the taxpayer is a partnership or trust, all of the owners or beneficiaries of which are corporations (looking through any partners or beneficiaries that are themselves partnerships or trusts), in which case the minimum fee is $250,000.
(iv)
Determination of minimum fee.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), in determining the minimum fee, all fees for a tax strategy or for services for advice (whether or not tax advice) or for the implementation of a transaction are taken into account. Fees include consideration in whatever form paid,
whether in cash or in kind, for services to analyze the transaction (whether or not related to the tax consequences of the transaction), for services to implement the transaction, for services to document the transaction, and for services to prepare tax returns to the extent return preparation fees are unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), a taxpayer also is treated as paying fees to an advisor if the taxpayer knows or should know that the amount it pays will be paid indirectly to the advisor, such as through a referral fee or fee-sharing arrangement. A fee does not include amounts paid to a person, including an advisor, in that person's capacity as a party to the transaction. For example, a fee does not include reasonable charges for the use of capital or the sale or use of property. The IRS will scrutinize carefully all of the facts and circumstances in determining whether consideration received in connection with a confidential transaction constitutes fees.
(v)
Related parties.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), persons who bear a relationship to each other as described in section 267(b) or 707(b) will be treated as the same person.
(4)
Transactions with contractual protection
—(i)
In general.
A transaction with contractual protection is a transaction for which the taxpayer or a related party (as described in section 267(b) or 707(b)) has the right to a full or partial refund of fees (as described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) if all or part of the intended tax consequences from the transaction are not sustained. A transaction with contractual protection also is a transaction for which fees (as described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) are contingent on the taxpayer's realization of tax benefits from the transaction. All the facts and circumstances relating to the transaction will be considered when determining whether a fee is refundable or contingent, including the right to reimbursements of amounts that the parties to the transaction have not designated as fees or any agreement to provide services without reasonable compensation.
(ii)
Fees.
Paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section only applies with respect to fees paid by or on behalf of the taxpayer or a related party to any person who makes or provides a statement, oral or written, to the taxpayer or related party (or for whose benefit a statement is made or provided to the taxpayer or related party) as to the potential tax consequences that may result from the transaction.
(iii)
Exceptions
—(A)
Termination of transaction.
A transaction is not considered to have contractual protection solely because a party to the transaction has the right to terminate the transaction upon the happening of an event affecting the taxation of one or more parties to the transaction.
(B)
Previously reported transaction.
If a person makes or provides a statement to a taxpayer as to the potential tax consequences that may result from a transaction only after the taxpayer has entered into the transaction and reported the consequences of the transaction on a filed tax return, and the person has not previously received fees from the taxpayer relating to the transaction, then any refundable or contingent fees are not taken into account in determining whether the transaction has contractual protection. This paragraph (b)(4) does not provide any substantive rules regarding when a person may charge refundable or contingent fees with respect to a transaction. See Circular 230, 31 CFR part 10, for the regulations governing practice before the IRS.
(5)
Loss transactions
—(i)
In general.
A loss transaction is any transaction resulting in the taxpayer claiming a loss under section 165 of at least—
(A) $10 million in any single taxable year or $20 million in any combination of taxable years for corporations;
(B) $10 million in any single taxable year or $20 million in any combination of taxable years for partnerships that have only corporations as partners (looking through any partners that are themselves partnerships), whether or not any losses flow through to one or more partners; or
(C) $2 million in any single taxable year or $4 million in any combination of taxable years for all other partnerships, whether or not any losses flow through to one or more partners;
(D) $2 million in any single taxable year or $4 million in any combination of taxable years for individuals, S corporations, or trusts, whether or not any losses flow through to one or more shareholders or beneficiaries; or
(E) $50,000 in any single taxable year for individuals or trusts, whether or not the loss flows through from an S corporation or partnership, if the loss arises with respect to a section 988 transaction (as defined in section 988(c)(1) relating to foreign currency transactions).
(ii)
Cumulative losses.
In determining whether a transaction results in a taxpayer claiming a loss that meets the threshold amounts over a combination of taxable years as described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, only losses claimed in the taxable year that the transaction is entered into and the five succeeding taxable years are combined.
(iii)
Section 165 loss
—(A) For purposes of this section, in determining the thresholds in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, the amount of a section 165 loss is adjusted for any salvage value and for any insurance or other compensation received. See § 1.165-1(c)(4). However, a section 165 loss does not take into account offsetting gains, or other income or limitations. For example, a section 165 loss does not take into account the limitation in section 165(d) (relating to wagering losses) or the limitations in sections 165(f), 1211, and 1212 (relating to capital losses). The full amount of a section 165 loss is taken into account for the year in which the loss is sustained, regardless of whether all or part of the loss enters into the computation of a net operating loss under section 172 or a net capital loss under section 1212 that is a carryback or carryover to another year. A section 165 loss does not include any portion of a loss, attributable to a capital loss carryback or carryover from another year, that is treated as a deemed capital loss under section 1212.
(B) For purposes of this section, a section 165 loss includes an amount deductible pursuant to a provision that treats a transaction as a sale or other disposition, or otherwise results in a deduction under section 165. A section 165 loss includes, for example, a loss resulting from a sale or exchange of a partnership interest under section 741 and a loss resulting from a section 988 transaction.
(6)
Transactions of interest.
A transaction of interest is a transaction that is the same as or substantially similar to one of the types of transactions that the IRS has identified by notice, regulation, or other form of published guidance as a transaction of interest.
(7) [Reserved]
(8)
Exceptions
—(i)
In general.
A transaction will not be considered a reportable transaction, or will be excluded from any individual category of reportable transaction under paragraphs (b)(3) through (7) of this section, if the Commissioner makes a determination by published guidance that the transaction is not subject to the reporting requirements of this section. The Commissioner may make a determination by individual letter ruling under paragraph (f) of this section that an individual letter ruling request on a specific transaction satisfies the reporting requirements of this section with regard to that transaction for the taxpayer who requests the individual letter ruling.
(ii)
Special rule for RICs.
For purposes of this section, a regulated investment company (RIC) as defined in section 851 or an investment vehicle that is owned 95 percent or more by one or more RICs at all times during the course of the transaction is not required to disclose a transaction that is described in any of paragraphs (b)(3) through (5) and (b)(7) of this section unless the transaction is also a listed transaction or a transaction of interest.
(c)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(1)
Taxpayer.
The term
taxpayer
means any person described in section 7701(a)(1), including S corporations. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, the term
taxpayer
also includes an affiliated group of corporations that joins in the filing of a consolidated return under section 1501.
(2)
Corporation.
When used specifically in this section, the term
corporation
means an entity that is required to file a return for a taxable year on any
1120 series form, or successor form, excluding S corporations.
(3)
Participation
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Listed transactions.
A taxpayer has participated in a listed transaction if the taxpayer's tax return reflects tax consequences or a tax strategy described in the published guidance that lists the transaction under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. A taxpayer also has participated in a listed transaction if the taxpayer knows or has reason to know that the taxpayer's tax benefits are derived directly or indirectly from tax consequences or a tax strategy described in published guidance that lists a transaction under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Published guidance may identify other types or classes of persons that will be treated as participants in a listed transaction. Published guidance also may identify types or classes of persons that will not be treated as participants in a listed transaction.
(B)
Confidential transactions.
A taxpayer has participated in a confidential transaction if the taxpayer's tax return reflects a tax benefit from the transaction and the taxpayer's disclosure of the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction is limited in the manner described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. If a partnership's, S corporation's or trust's disclosure is limited, and the partner's, shareholder's, or beneficiary's disclosure is not limited, then the partnership, S corporation, or trust, and not the partner, shareholder, or beneficiary, has participated in the confidential transaction.
(C)
Transactions with contractual protection.
A taxpayer has participated in a transaction with contractual protection if the taxpayer's tax return reflects a tax benefit from the transaction and, as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the taxpayer has the right to the full or partial refund of fees or the fees are contingent. If a partnership, S corporation, or trust has the right to a full or partial refund of fees or has a contingent fee arrangement, and the partner, shareholder, or beneficiary does not individually have the right to the refund of fees or a contingent fee arrangement, then the partnership, S corporation, or trust, and not the partner, shareholder, or beneficiary, has participated in the transaction with contractual protection.
(D)
Loss transactions.
A taxpayer has participated in a loss transaction if the taxpayer's tax return reflects a section 165 loss and the amount of the section 165 loss equals or exceeds the threshold amount applicable to the taxpayer as described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section. If a taxpayer is a partner in a partnership, shareholder in an S corporation, or beneficiary of a trust and a section 165 loss as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section flows through the entity to the taxpayer (disregarding netting at the entity level), the taxpayer has participated in a loss transaction if the taxpayer's tax return reflects a section 165 loss and the amount of the section 165 loss that flows through to the taxpayer equals or exceeds the threshold amounts applicable to the taxpayer as described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section. For this purpose, a tax return is deemed to reflect the full amount of a section 165 loss described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section allocable to the taxpayer under this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D), regardless of whether all or part of the loss enters into the computation of a net operating loss under section 172 or net capital loss under section 1212 that the taxpayer may carry back or carry over to another year.
(E)
Transactions of interest.
A taxpayer has participated in a transaction of interest if the taxpayer is one of the types or classes of persons identified as participants in the transaction in the published guidance describing the transaction of interest.
(F) [Reserved]
(G)
Shareholders of foreign corporations
—(
1
)
In general.
A reporting shareholder of a foreign corporation participates in a transaction described in paragraphs (b)(2) through (5) and (b)(7) of this section if the foreign corporation would be considered to participate in the transaction under the rules of this paragraph (c)(3) if it were a domestic corporation filing a tax return that reflects the items from the transaction. A reporting shareholder of a foreign corporation participates in a transaction described in paragraph
(b)(6) of this section only if the published guidance identifying the transaction includes the reporting shareholder among the types or classes of persons identified as participants. A reporting shareholder (and any successor in interest) is considered to participate in a transaction under this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(G) only for its first taxable year with or within which ends the first taxable year of the foreign corporation in which the foreign corporation participates in the transaction, and for the reporting shareholder's five succeeding taxable years.
(
2
)
Reporting shareholder.
The term
reporting shareholder
means a United States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)) in a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957) or a 10 percent shareholder (by vote or value) of a qualified electing fund (as defined in section 1295).
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section:

# Example 1.
Notice 2003-55 (2003-2 CB 395), which modified and superseded Notice 95-53 (1995-2 CB 334) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), describes a lease stripping transaction in which one party (the transferor) assigns the right to receive future payments under a lease of tangible property and treats the amount realized from the assignment as its current income. The transferor later transfers the property subject to the lease in a transaction intended to qualify as a transferred basis transaction, for example, a transaction described in section 351. The transferee corporation claims the deductions associated with the high basis property subject to the lease. The transferor's and transferee corporation's tax returns reflect tax positions described in Notice 2003-55. Therefore, the transferor and transferee corporation have participated in the listed transaction. In the section 351 transaction, the transferor will have received stock with low value and high basis from the transferee corporation. If the transferor subsequently transfers the high basis/low value stock to a taxpayer in another transaction intended to qualify as a transferred basis transaction and the taxpayer uses the stock to generate a loss, and if the taxpayer knows or has reason to know that the tax loss claimed was derived indirectly from the lease stripping transaction, then the taxpayer has participated in the listed transaction. Accordingly, the taxpayer must disclose the transaction and the manner of the taxpayer's participation in the transaction under the rules of this section. For purposes of this example, if a bank lends money to the transferor, transferee corporation, or taxpayer for use in their transactions, the bank has not participated in the listed transaction because the bank's tax return does not reflect tax consequences or a tax strategy described in the listing notice (nor does the bank's tax return reflect a tax benefit derived from tax consequences or a tax strategy described in the listing notice) nor is the bank described as a participant in the listing notice.

# Example 2.
XYZ is a limited liability company treated as a partnership for tax purposes. X, Y, and Z are members of XYZ. X is an individual, Y is an S corporation, and Z is a partnership. XYZ enters into a confidential transaction under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. XYZ and X are bound by the confidentiality agreement, but Y and Z are not bound by the agreement. As a result of the transaction, XYZ, X, Y, and Z all reflect a tax benefit on their tax returns. Because XYZ's and X's disclosure of the tax treatment and tax structure are limited in the manner described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and their tax returns reflect a tax benefit from the transaction, both XYZ and X have participated in the confidential transaction. Neither Y nor Z has participated in the confidential transaction because they are not subject to the confidentiality agreement.

# Example 3.
P, a corporation, has an 80% partnership interest in PS, and S, an individual, has a 20% partnership interest in PS. P, S, and PS are calendar year taxpayers. In 2006, PS enters into a transaction and incurs a section 165 loss (that does not meet any of the exceptions to a section 165 loss identified in published guidance) of $12 million and offsetting gain of $3 million. On PS' 2006 tax return, PS includes the section 165 loss and the corresponding gain. PS must disclose the transaction under this section because PS' section 165 loss of $12 million is equal to or greater than $2 million. P is allocated $9.6 million of the section 165 loss and $2.4 million of the offsetting gain. P does not have to disclose the transaction under this section because P's section 165 loss of $9.6 million is not equal to or greater than $10 million. S is allocated $2.4 million of the section 165 loss and $600,000 of the offsetting gain. S must disclose the transaction under this section because S's section 165 loss of $2.4 million is equal to or greater than $2 million.
(4)
Substantially similar.
The term
substantially similar
includes any transaction that is expected to obtain the same or similar types of tax consequences and that is either factually similar or based on the same or similar tax strategy. Receipt of an opinion regarding the tax consequences of the
transaction is not relevant to the determination of whether the transaction is the same as or substantially similar to another transaction. Further, the term
substantially similar
must be broadly construed in favor of disclosure. For example, a transaction may be substantially similar to a listed transaction even though it involves different entities or uses different Internal Revenue Code provisions. (See for example, Notice 2003-54 (2003-2 CB 363), describing a transaction substantially similar to the transactions in Notice 2002-50 (2002-2 CB 98), and Notice 2002-65 (2002-2 CB 690).) The following examples illustrate situations where a transaction is the same as or substantially similar to a listed transaction under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (Such transactions may also be reportable transactions under paragraphs (b)(3) through (7) of this section.) See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (c)(4):

# Example 1.
Notice 2000-44 (2000-2 CB 255) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter), sets forth a listed transaction involving offsetting options transferred to a partnership where the taxpayer claims basis in the partnership for the cost of the purchased options but does not adjust basis under section 752 as a result of the partnership's assumption of the taxpayer's obligation with respect to the options. Transactions using short sales, futures, derivatives or any other type of offsetting obligations to inflate basis in a partnership interest would be the same as or substantially similar to the transaction described in Notice 2000-44. Moreover, use of the inflated basis in the partnership interest to diminish gain that would otherwise be recognized on the transfer of a partnership asset would also be the same as or substantially similar to the transaction described in Notice 2000-44. See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
).

# Example 2.
Notice 2001-16 (2001-1 CB 730) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter), sets forth a listed transaction involving a seller (X) who desires to sell stock of a corporation (T), an intermediary corporation (M), and a buyer (Y) who desires to purchase the assets (and not the stock) of T. M agrees to facilitate the sale to prevent the recognition of the gain that T would otherwise report. Notice 2001-16 describes M as a member of a consolidated group that has a loss within the group or as a party not subject to tax. Transactions utilizing different intermediaries to prevent the recognition of gain would be the same as or substantially similar to the transaction described in Notice 2001-16. An example is a transaction in which M is a corporation that does not file a consolidated return but which buys T stock, liquidates T, sells assets of T to Y, and offsets the gain on the sale of those assets with currently generated losses. See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
).
(5)
Tax.
The term
tax
means Federal income tax.
(6)
Tax benefit.
A tax benefit includes deductions, exclusions from gross income, nonrecognition of gain, tax credits, adjustments (or the absence of adjustments) to the basis of property, status as an entity exempt from Federal income taxation, and any other tax consequences that may reduce a taxpayer's Federal income tax liability by affecting the amount, timing, character, or source of any item of income, gain, expense, loss, or credit.
(7)
Tax return.
The term
tax return
means a Federal income tax return and a Federal information return.
(8)
Tax treatment.
The tax treatment of a transaction is the purported or claimed Federal income tax treatment of the transaction.
(9)
Tax structure.
The tax structure of a transaction is any fact that may be relevant to understanding the purported or claimed Federal income tax treatment of the transaction.
(d)
Form and content of disclosure statement.
A taxpayer required to file a disclosure statement under this section must file a completed Form 8886, “Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement” (or a successor form), in accordance with this paragraph (d) and the instructions to the form. The Form 8886 (or a successor form) is the disclosure statement required under this section. The form must be attached to the appropriate tax return(s) as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. If a copy of a disclosure statement is required to be sent to the Office of Tax Shelter Analysis (OTSA) under paragraph (e) of this section, it must be sent in accordance with the instructions to the form. To be considered complete, the information provided on the form must describe the expected tax treatment and all potential tax benefits expected to result from the transaction, describe any tax result protection (as defined in § 301.6111-3(c)(12) of this chapter) with respect to the transaction, and identify
and describe the transaction in sufficient detail for the IRS to be able to understand the tax structure of the reportable transaction and the identity of all parties involved in the transaction. An incomplete Form 8886 (or a successor form) containing a statement that information will be provided upon request is not considered a complete disclosure statement. If the form is not completed in accordance with the provisions in this paragraph (d) and the instructions to the form, the taxpayer will not be considered to have complied with the disclosure requirements of this section. If a taxpayer receives one or more reportable transaction numbers for a reportable transaction, the taxpayer must include the reportable transaction number(s) on the Form 8886 (or a successor form). See § 301.6111-3(d)(2) of this chapter.
(e)
Time of providing disclosure
—(1)
In general.
The disclosure statement for a reportable transaction must be attached to the taxpayer's tax return for each taxable year for which a taxpayer participates in a reportable transaction. In addition, a disclosure statement for a reportable transaction must be attached to each amended return that reflects a taxpayer's participation in a reportable transaction. A copy of the disclosure statement must be sent to OTSA at the same time that any disclosure statement is first filed by the taxpayer pertaining to a particular reportable transaction. If a reportable transaction results in a loss which is carried back to a prior year, the disclosure statement for the reportable transaction must be attached to the taxpayer's application for tentative refund or amended tax return for that prior year. In the case of a taxpayer that is a partnership, an S corporation, or a trust, the disclosure statement for a reportable transaction must be attached to the partnership, S corporation, or trust's tax return for each taxable year in which the partnership, S corporation, or trust participates in the transaction under the rules of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. If a taxpayer who is a partner in a partnership, a shareholder in an S corporation, or a beneficiary of a trust receives a timely Schedule K-1 less than 10 calendar days before the due date of the taxpayer's return (including extensions) and, based on receipt of the timely Schedule K-1, the taxpayer determines that the taxpayer participated in a reportable transaction within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the disclosure statement will not be considered late if the taxpayer discloses the reportable transaction by filing a disclosure statement with OTSA within 60 calendar days after the due date of the taxpayer's return (including extensions). The Commissioner in his discretion may issue in published guidance other provisions for disclosure under § 1.6011-4.
(2)
Special rules
—(i)
Listed transactions and transactions of interest.
In general, if a transaction becomes a listed transaction or a transaction of interest after the filing of a taxpayer's tax return (including an amended return) reflecting the taxpayer's participation in the listed transaction or transaction of interest and before the end of the period of limitations for assessment of tax for any taxable year in which the taxpayer participated in the listed transaction or transaction of interest, then a disclosure statement must be filed, regardless of whether the taxpayer participated in the transaction in the year the transaction became a listed transaction or a transaction of interest, with OTSA within 90 calendar days after the date on which the transaction became a listed transaction or a transaction of interest. The Commissioner also may determine the time for disclosure of listed transactions and transactions of interest in the published guidance identifying the transaction.
(ii)
Loss transactions.
If a transaction becomes a loss transaction because the losses equal or exceed the threshold amounts as described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, a disclosure statement must be filed as an attachment to the taxpayer's tax return for the first taxable year in which the threshold amount is reached and to any subsequent tax return that reflects any amount of section 165 loss from the transaction.
(3)
Multiple disclosures.
The taxpayer must disclose the transaction in the time and manner provided for under the provisions of this section regardless of whether the taxpayer also plans
to disclose the transaction under other published guidance, for example, § 1.6662-3(c)(2).
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (e):

# Example.
In January of 2008, F, a calendar year taxpayer, enters into a transaction that at the time is not a listed transaction and is not a transaction described in any of the paragraphs (b)(3) through (7) of this section. All the tax benefits from the transaction are reported on F's 2008 tax return filed timely in April 2009. On May 2, 2011, the IRS publishes a notice identifying the transaction as a listed transaction described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Upon issuance of the May 2, 2011 notice, the transaction becomes a reportable transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section. The period of limitations on assessment for F's 2008 taxable year is still open. F is required to file Form 8886 for the transaction with OTSA within 90 calendar days after May 2, 2011.
(f)
Rulings and protective disclosures
—(1)
Rulings.
If a taxpayer requests a ruling on the merits of a specific transaction on or before the date that disclosure would otherwise be required under this section, and receives a favorable ruling as to the transaction, the disclosure rules under this section will be deemed to have been satisfied by that taxpayer with regard to that transaction, so long as the request fully discloses all relevant facts relating to the transaction which would otherwise be required to be disclosed under this section. If a taxpayer requests a ruling as to whether a specific transaction is a reportable transaction on or before the date that disclosure would otherwise be required under this section, the Commissioner in his discretion may determine that the submission satisfies the disclosure rules under this section for the taxpayer requesting the ruling for that transaction if the request fully discloses all relevant facts relating to the transaction which would otherwise be required to be disclosed under this section. The potential obligation of the taxpayer to disclose the transaction under this section will not be suspended during the period that the ruling request is pending.
(2)
Protective disclosures.
If a taxpayer is uncertain whether a transaction must be disclosed under this section, the taxpayer may disclose the transaction in accordance with the requirements of this section and comply with all the provisions of this section, and indicate on the disclosure statement that the disclosure statement is being filed on a protective basis. The IRS will not treat disclosure statements filed on a protective basis any differently than other disclosure statements filed under this section. For a protective disclosure to be effective, the taxpayer must comply with these disclosure regulations by providing to the IRS all information requested by the IRS under this section.
(g)
Retention of documents.
(1) In accordance with the instructions to Form 8886 (or a successor form), the taxpayer must retain a copy of all documents and other records related to a transaction subject to disclosure under this section that are material to an understanding of the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction. The documents must be retained until the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the final taxable year for which disclosure of the transaction was required under this section. (This document retention requirement is in addition to any document retention requirements that section 6001 generally imposes on the taxpayer.) The documents may include the following:
(i) Marketing materials related to the transaction;
(ii) Written analyses used in decision-making related to the transaction;
(iii) Correspondence and agreements between the taxpayer and any advisor, lender, or other party to the reportable transaction that relate to the transaction;
(iv) Documents discussing, referring to, or demonstrating the purported or claimed tax benefits arising from the reportable transaction; and documents, if any, referring to the business purposes for the reportable transaction.
(2) A taxpayer is not required to retain earlier drafts of a document if the taxpayer retains a copy of the final document (or, if there is no final document, the most recent draft of the document) and the final document (or most recent draft) contains all the information in the earlier drafts of the
document that is material to an understanding of the purported tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction.

(c)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:
(1)
Charitable contribution deduction.
The term
charitable contribution deduction
means a deduction under section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), which includes a deduction arising from a qualified conservation contribution as defined in section 170(h)(1) of the Code.
(2)
Conservation easement.
The term
conservation easement
means a restriction (granted in perpetuity) on the use which may be made of the real property, within the meaning of section 170(h)(2)(C) of the Code, exclusively for conservation purposes, within the meaning of section 170(h)(1)(C) and (h)(4) of the Code.
(3)
Pass-through entity.
The term
pass-through entity
means a partnership, S corporation, or trust (other than a grantor trust within the meaning of subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code).
(4)
Promotional materials.
The term
promotional materials
includes materials described in § 301.6112-1(b)(3)(iii)(B) of this chapter and any other written or oral communication regarding the transaction provided to investors, such as marketing materials, appraisals (including preliminary appraisals, draft appraisals, and the appraisal that is attached to the taxpayer's return), websites, transactional documents such as deeds of conveyance, private placement memoranda, tax opinions, operating agreements, subscription agreements, statements of the anticipated value of the conservation easement, and statements of the anticipated amount of the charitable contribution deduction.
(5)
Qualified organization.
The term
qualified organization
means an organization described in section 170(h)(3) of the Code.
(6)
Real property.
The term
real property
includes all land, structures, and buildings, including a certified historic structure defined in section 170(h)(4)(C) of the Code.
(7)
Substantially similar.
The term
substantially similar
is defined in § 1.6011-4(c)(4). For example, transactions that meet the elements of paragraph (b) of this section, except that the pass-through entity contributes a fee simple interest in real property or a real property interest described in section 170(h)(2)(A) or (B) of the Code rather than a conservation easement, are substantially similar to the listed transaction identified in this section.
(d)
Application of the 2.5 times rule
—(1)
Bright-line rule.
Transactions for which the promotional materials offer the taxpayer the possibility of being allocated a charitable contribution deduction of only an amount less than 2.5 times the taxpayer's investment and for which the taxpayer is actually allocated a charitable contribution deduction of an amount less than 2.5 times the taxpayer's investment (so that the rebuttable presumption in paragraph (d)(3) of this section does not apply) are generally not considered
substantially similar
to the listed transaction identified in this section. However, if a pass-through entity engages in a series of transactions with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of the bright-line rule in this paragraph (d)(1), the series of transactions may be disregarded or the arrangement may be recharacterized in accordance with its substance. Whether a series of transactions has a principal purpose of avoiding the application of this bright-line rule is determined based on all the facts and circumstances.
(2)
Multiple suggested contribution amounts.
If the promotional materials suggest or imply a range of possible charitable contribution deduction amounts that may be allocated to the taxpayer, the highest suggested or implied contribution amount determines whether the 2.5 times rule in this paragraph (d) is met. In addition, if one piece of promotional materials (for example, an appraisal or oral statement) states a higher charitable contribution deduction amount than stated by other promotional materials, then the highest stated charitable contribution deduction amount determines whether the 2.5 times rule is met.
(3)
Rebuttable presumption.
The 2.5 times rule in this paragraph (d) is deemed to be met if the pass-through entity donates a real property interest within three years following the taxpayer's investment in the pass-through entity, the pass-through entity allocates a charitable contribution deduction to the taxpayer the amount of which equals or exceeds two and one-half times the amount of the taxpayer's investment, and the taxpayer claims a charitable contribution deduction the amount of which equals or exceeds two and one-half times the amount of the taxpayer's investment. This presumption may be rebutted if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that none of the promotional materials contained a suggestion or implication that investors might be allocated a charitable contribution deduction that equals or exceeds an amount that is two and one-half times the amount of their investment in the pass-through entity.
(4)
Determining the amount of the taxpayer's investment in the pass-through entity
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer may determine the amount of the taxpayer's investment in the pass-through entity for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section using either the anti-stuffing method in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section or, for contributions made after December 29, 2022, the relevant basis method in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section. No other methods may be used.
(ii)
Anti-stuffing method.
Under the anti-stuffing method, the amount of a taxpayer's investment in the pass-through entity is the portion of the cash or fair market value of the assets the taxpayer uses to acquire its interest in the pass-through entity that is attributable to the real property on which a conservation easement is placed (or the portion thereof, if an easement is placed on a portion of the real property) that gives rise to the charitable contribution described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For example, if a portion of the taxpayer's cost of acquiring the taxpayer's interest in the pass-through entity is attributable to property held directly or indirectly by the pass-through entity other than the real property on which a conservation easement is placed as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section (such other property may include other real property, cash, cash equivalents, digital assets, marketable securities, or other tangible or intangible assets), that portion of the taxpayer's acquisition cost is not considered part of the taxpayer's investment for purposes of this section because it is not attributable to the portion of the real property on which a conservation easement is placed as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)(ii), assets retained to pay for costs related to the operation and maintenance of the real property on which the conservation easement is placed, including costs that may be incurred in future years, are not attributable to the real property on which a conservation easement is placed as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. In the case of a substantially similar transaction described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the rules in this paragraph (d)(4)(ii) apply except that the relevant real property that gives rise to the charitable contribution deduction described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is the real property donated.
(iii)
Relevant basis method.
For contributions made after December 29, 2022, taxpayers may use their relevant basis, as determined in accordance with section 170(h)(7)(B) of the Code and § 1.170A-14(k), as the amount of their investment for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section.
(5)
Examples.
For the examples in this paragraph (d)(5), assume that the partnerships are respected for Federal tax purposes, and that the partnership allocations comply with the rules of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code.
(i)
Example 1
—(A)
Facts.
Individual A purchased an interest in P, a partnership that owns real property with a fair market value of $500,000 and marketable securities with a fair market value of $500,000. A is one of four equal investors in P, each of whom purchased its interest in P for $250,000 of cash. With respect to an investor's $250,000 payment for its interest in P, the promotional materials stated that P expected to allocate a $500,000 charitable contribution deduction to the investor (that is, a charitable contribution deduction that is two times the amount an investor paid for its interest in P). After all four investors have purchased their interests in P, P donates a conservation easement on all of its real property to a qualified organization as defined in section 170(h)(3) of the Code and reports a $2,000,000 charitable contribution on its Form 1065,
U.S. Return of Partnership Income,
based on P obtaining an appraisal indicating that the value of the conservation easement is $2,000,000. The Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) that P furnishes to A indicates that P allocated a charitable contribution deduction to A for the taxable year. A claims a charitable contribution deduction with respect to the charitable contribution on A's Federal income tax return.
(B)
Analysis.
A's cost of acquiring its interest in P is $250,000. The real property on which a conservation easement was placed and that gave rise to the charitable contribution deduction described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section was P's property valued at $500,000. P's only other asset was marketable securities worth $500,000. Accordingly, half of A's share of the value of the assets held by P was attributable to the real property on which P placed a conservation easement and that gave rise to the charitable contribution deduction described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of A's investment in P is $125,000 (that is, half of A's $250,000 acquisition cost, which is the portion of A's acquisition cost that is attributable to the real property on which P placed a conservation easement and that gave rise to the charitable contribution deduction described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section). Because A's investment for purposes of the 2.5 times rule is $125,000 and A's expected charitable contribution deduction, based on the promotional materials, is $500,000 (that is, an expected deduction that is four times A's investment), the 2.5 times rule of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is met. The transaction also meets the other elements of a syndicated conservation easement within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section and therefore is a listed transaction for purposes of § 1.6011-4(b)(2).
(ii)
Example 2
—(A)
Facts.
Individual B acquires a ten percent interest in InvestCo, a partnership, by making a $250,000 cash contribution. Immediately after B's acquisition, InvestCo's only asset is $2,500,000 of cash. The promotional materials state that InvestCo expects to allocate a $500,000 charitable contribution deduction to B with respect to B's partnership interest. InvestCo pays $600,000 to purchase marketable securities. InvestCo also purchases an interest in another partnership, PropCo, for $1,900,000 from one of PropCo's partners. At the same time as the purchase, InvestCo also contributes $100,000 of its marketable securities to PropCo. Immediately after InvestCo's purchase and contribution, PropCo's only assets are real property worth $2,400,000 and the marketable securities worth $100,000. PropCo donates its entire interest in the real property (a fee simple interest) to a qualified organization as defined in section 170(h)(3) of the Code and reports a $6,250,000 charitable contribution on its Form 1065,
U.S. Return of Partnership Income,
based on PropCo obtaining an appraisal indicating that the value of the real property is $6,250,000. PropCo allocates a portion of the charitable contribution deduction to InvestCo. The Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) that InvestCo furnishes to B indicates that InvestCo allocated a charitable contribution deduction to
B for the taxable year. B claims a charitable contribution deduction with respect to the contribution on B's Federal income tax return.
(B)
Analysis.
Immediately after InvestCo's acquisition of its interest in PropCo, InvestCo's only assets were its interest in PropCo and $500,000 in marketable securities. Accordingly, eighty percent of InvestCo's funds ($2,000,000/$2,500,000) were used to acquire its interest in PropCo. B's investment in InvestCo is $250,000; therefore, eighty percent of that amount, $200,000, is attributable to InvestCo's interest in PropCo. Immediately after InvestCo's acquisition of its interest in PropCo, PropCo had real property worth $2,400,000 and marketable securities worth $100,000. As such, ninety-six percent ($2,400,000/$2,500,000) of PropCo's assets were the real property that was subsequently donated. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of B's investment in InvestCo that is attributable to the donated real property that gave rise to the charitable contribution deduction described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is $200,000 multiplied by ninety-six percent, or $192,000. Because B's investment for purposes of the 2.5 times rule is $192,000 and B's expected charitable contribution deduction, based on the promotional materials, is $500,000 (that is, an expected deduction that is at least 2.5 times B's investment), the 2.5 times rule of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is met. The transaction also meets the other elements of a syndicated conservation easement within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section, except that PropCo contributed a fee simple interest in real property rather than a conservation easement. Under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the transaction is substantially similar to the listed transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section and, therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, the transaction in this example is a listed transaction for purposes of § 1.6011-4(b)(2).

In general.
Whether a taxpayer has participated in a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) of this section or a substantially similar transaction described in paragraph (d) of this section during a taxable year is determined under this paragraph (e).

A participating partnership participates in a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) or a substantially similar transaction described in paragraph (d) of this section in any taxable year in which the partnership makes a distribution of property to a participating partner in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section, or a participating partnership interest is transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(2) or (d)(2) of this section.
(4)
Related subsequent transferees.
A related subsequent transferee participates in a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) of this section or a substantially similar transaction described in paragraph (d) of this section in any taxable year in which the related subsequent transferee directly receives, in a nonrecognition transaction, a transfer (including a distribution) of property that was subject to an increase in basis as a result of a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section that was required to be disclosed under paragraph (f) of this section.
(5)
Subsequent realization of tax benefit.
A participating partnership, participating partner, or related subsequent transferee also participates in a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) or a substantially similar transaction described in paragraph (d) of this section in any taxable year in which its tax return reflects the tax consequences of a basis increase resulting from a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, taking into account the limitations provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section. For example, if a participating partner sells property the basis of which has been increased as a result of a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) of this section during a taxable year after the taxable year in which the transaction of interest occurred, the participating partner participates in a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) of this section in the taxable year of the basis increase and in the taxable year of the sale.

(D) With respect to a participating partner that transfers an interest in a participating partnership, that participating partner's adjusted basis in the participating partnership interest and share of the participating partnership's adjusted basis in its property immediately before the transfer.
(iii) Any Federal income tax consequences realized during the taxable year as a result of a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, including any cost recovery allowances attributable to any increase in basis as a result of a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section, and any gain or loss attributable to the disposition of property that was subject to an increase in basis as a result of a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. The Federal income tax consequences attributable to an increase in basis resulting from a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section are limited to those attributable to the increase in basis, taking into account the limitations of paragraph (c)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section. For example, in the case of a distribution of depreciable property that was subject to an increase in basis because of a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the Federal income tax consequences realized during the taxable year include the basis increase and cost recovery allowances attributable to the basis increase during the taxable year.
(2)
Six-year lookback period for taxable years described in special rule of § 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i).
For purposes of the special rule of § 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i) (describing the disclosure requirement with respect to a transaction that is identified as a transaction of interest after the filing of the taxpayer's tax return (including an amended return) reflecting the taxpayer's participation in the transaction of interest but before the end of the period of limitations for assessment of tax for such taxable year), a participant must provide the information described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section for such open years only if the transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section occurred within the six-year lookback period described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section.
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section.
(1)
Example 1: Reporting by a participating partner and participating partnership in the taxable year of the transaction, including cost recovery allowances
—(i)
Facts.
ABC Partnership is owned by partners A, B, and C. Partners A, B, and C are related within the meaning of paragraphs (b)(8) and (9) of this section. At the beginning of taxable year 2025, ABC Partnership distributes a depreciable asset, Property X, to Partner A in liquidation of Partner A's interest in ABC Partnership. The distribution is a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. As a result of the distribution, the basis of Property X is increased by $10 million in Partner A's hands. On its tax return for taxable year 2025, Partner A reports deductions for depreciation expense attributable to the $10 million increase in the basis of Property X resulting from the transaction under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. In addition, ABC Partnership must reduce the basis of its remaining property under section 734(b)(2) as a result of the distribution of Property X to Partner A by $10 million. ABC Partnership and Partner A use the calendar year as their taxable year.
(ii)
Analysis.
Partner A is a participant during taxable year 2025 within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section because it is a participating partner within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section since it directly received a distribution of property during taxable year 2025 in a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section. ABC Partnership is a participant during taxable year 2025 within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section because it is a participating partnership within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4) of this section since it made a distribution of property to a participating partner during taxable year 2025 in a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section. As part of its disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e), Partner A must disclose the distribution as a transaction of interest under this section on Form 8886 (or successor form) and file the form with its tax return for taxable year 2025. Partner A must include the information described in paragraph (f) of this section, including the amount of the deductions attributable to the $10 million increase in the basis of Property X resulting from the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. As part of its disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e), ABC Partnership must disclose the distribution as a transaction of interest under this section on Form 8886 (or successor form) and file the form with its tax return for taxable year 2025, including the information described in paragraph (f) of this section. In addition, Partner A and ABC Partnership must send a copy of their respective Form 8886 (or successor form) to the Office of Tax Shelter Analysis (OTSA).
(2)
Example 2: Reporting of the Federal income tax consequences (cost recovery allowances) of the transaction in all taxable years
—(i)
Facts.
Under the same facts as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1),
on its tax returns for taxable years 2026 through 2030, Partner A reports deductions for depreciation expense attributable to the $10 million increase in the basis of Property X related to the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, which occurred in taxable year 2025.
(ii)
Analysis.
As part of its disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e), Partner A must disclose the deductions on Form 8886 (or successor form) for taxable years 2026 through 2030 as the Federal income tax consequences of the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. As a result, for each of taxable years 2026 through 2030, Partner A must file the form with its tax return for the taxable year with the information described in paragraph (f) of this section, including the amount of the deductions for the taxable year attributable to the $10 million increase in the basis of Property X resulting from the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Example 3: Reporting by a participating partner, participating partnership, and related subsequent transferee in the taxable year of the transaction
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1),
except that at the beginning of taxable year 2025, instead of distributing a depreciable asset, ABC Partnership distributes a nondepreciable asset, Land with an adjusted basis of $5 million, to Partner A in liquidation of Partner A's interest in ABC Partnership. The distribution is a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. As a result of the distribution, the basis of Land is increased to $15 million in Partner A's hands. Subsequently in the same taxable year 2025, Partner A contributes Land to another partnership, AX Partnership, in a transfer that is treated as a contribution of property under section 721(a). Partner A and AX Partnership are related within the meaning of paragraph (b)(8) of this section. ABC Partnership, Partner A and AX Partnership use the calendar year as their taxable year.
(ii)
Analysis.
Partner A is a participant during taxable year 2025 within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section because it is a participating partner within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section since Partner A directly received a distribution of property during taxable year 2025 in a transaction described in paragraph
(c) of this section. ABC Partnership is a participant during taxable year 2025 within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section because it is a participating partnership within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4) of this section since it made a distribution of property to a participating partner during taxable year 2025 in a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section. AX Partnership is a participant during taxable year 2025 within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section because it is a related subsequent transferee within the meaning of paragraph (b)(10) of this section since it directly received in a nonrecognition transaction a transfer of property during taxable year 2025 that was subject to an increase in basis because of a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section. As part of its disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e), Partner A must disclose the distribution as a transaction of interest under this section on Form 8886 (or successor form) and file the form with its tax return for taxable year 2025. Partner A must include the information described in paragraph (f) of this section. As part of its disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e), ABC Partnership must disclose the distribution as a transaction of interest under this section on Form 8886 (or successor form) and file the form with its tax return for taxable year 2025, including the information described in paragraph (f) of this section. Further, AX Partnership is subject to the disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e). AX Partnership must disclose that it is a related subsequent transferee within the meaning of paragraph (b)(10) of this section that received, in a nonrecognition transaction, a transfer of property that was distributed in a transaction of interest under this section on Form 8886 (or successor form) and file the form with its tax return for taxable year 2025. In addition, Partner A, ABC Partnership and AX Partnership must send a copy of their respective Form 8886 (or successor form) to the OTSA.
(4)
Example 4: Reporting of the Federal income tax consequences (reduced taxable gain) of the transaction in the taxable year of disposition of the property
—(i)
Facts.
Under the same facts as in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section (
Example 3),
in taxable year 2026, AX Partnership disposes of Land in a taxable sale for its fair market value of $15 million and recognizes no gain or loss.
(ii)
Analysis.
As part of its disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e), AX Partnership must disclose the taxable gain (zero) on the disposition of Land on Form 8886 (or successor form) for taxable year 2026 as the Federal income tax consequences of the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. AX Partnership must file the form with its tax return for taxable year 2026. Partner A does not have a disclosure requirement with respect to AX Partnership's disposition of Land because the disposition is a subsequent realization of a tax benefit within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5) of this section with respect to AX Partnership.
(5)
Example 5. Reporting of a transaction of interest that occurred within the six-year lookback period
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1),
except that instead of ABC Partnership distributing Property X in taxable year 2025, the distribution is made in May of taxable year 2022, which is within the six-year lookback period described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section. That is, the distribution occurred within the seventy-two months immediately preceding January 2025, the first month of the taxpayer's most recent taxable year that began before January 14, 2025. Further, taxable year 2022 is an open taxable year subject to the special rule of § 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i). Additionally, neither Partner A nor ABC Partnership engages in any other transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section for taxable year 2022.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because the transaction occurred within the six-year lookback period described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section, the applicable threshold described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section is $25 million as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The distribution of Property X to Partner A
is not a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to either Partner A or ABC Partnership because the applicable threshold is not met for taxable year 2022. Had the applicable threshold for taxable year 2022 been met, all the information required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section must be reported in its disclosure for taxable year 2022 and for any subsequent taxable year for which the taxpayer's return reflected the tax consequences of the transaction.
(6)
Example 6. No reporting of a transaction of interest for transaction that occurred prior to the six-year lookback period
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1),
except that as a result of the distribution of Property X to Partner A, the basis of Property X is increased by $30 million, and the distribution occurred in December of taxable year 2018, which is prior to the six-year lookback period described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section. That is, the transaction occurred prior to January 2019, which is the beginning of the seventy-two-month period that ends in December 2024. In addition, taxable year 2018 is an open taxable year subject to the special rule of § 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i). Further, Partner A realized Federal income tax consequences (depreciation expense) in taxable year 2019 attributable to the $30 million increase to the basis of Property X and taxable year 2019 is an open taxable year subject to the special rule of § 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i).
(ii)
Analysis.
Because taxable year 2018 is not within the six-year lookback period, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, neither the distribution of Property X to Partner A, nor any of the Federal income tax consequences arising in that taxable year or later taxable years (such as depreciation expense in taxable year 2019 or any later taxable year) from such distribution, is required to be disclosed under paragraph (f) of this section and §§ 1.6011-4(d) and (e).
(7)
Example 7. Corresponding basis decrease under section 734(b)(2)(B) shared by an unrelated partner
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1),
except Partner C is unrelated to Partners A and B and is not a tax-indifferent party. As a result of the distribution of Property X to Partner A, and the increase to the basis of Property X by $10 million in Partner A's hands, ABC Partnership is required to reduce the adjusted basis of its remaining properties under section 734(b)(2)(B) by $10 million. Partner B's and Partner C's share of ABC Partnership's basis decrease to its remaining properties is $5 million each. Neither Partner A nor ABC Partnership engages in any other transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section for taxable year 2025.
(ii)
Analysis.
For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(3)(i) of this section, under paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, only $5 million of the $10 million basis increase to Property X counts toward the applicable threshold because $5 million of the basis increase corresponds to unrelated Partner C's share of the decrease to the basis of ABC Partnership's remaining properties under section 734(b)(2)(B) and thus, is excluded from the calculation of the applicable threshold. Thus, the distribution of Property X to Partner A is not a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to either Partner A or ABC Partnership because the applicable threshold is not met for taxable year 2025.
(h)
Extension of time—(1) Taxpayer disclosures.
Taxpayers will be treated as having met their requirements to disclose timely under § 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i) if they file their disclosure with the OTSA by July 14, 2025.
(2)
Material advisor disclosures.
Material advisors who have made a tax statement before January 14, 2025 will be treated as having met their requirements to disclose timely under § 301.6111-3(e) of this chapter if they file their disclosure with the OTSA by the date that is an additional 90 days beyond the last day for filing specified in § 301.6111-3(e) of this chapter.
(i)
Applicability date
—(1)
In general.
This section's identification of transactions that are the same as or substantially similar (within the meaning of § 1.6011-4(c)(4)) to the transactions described in paragraph (c) of this section as transactions of interest for purposes of § 1.6011-4(b)(6) and sections 6111
and 6112 of the Code is effective January 14, 2025.
(2)
Material advisors.
Notwithstanding § 301.6111-3(b)(4)(i) and (iii) of this chapter, material advisors are required to disclose only if they have made a tax statement on or after January 14, 2019.
[T.D. 10028, 90 FR 2972, Jan. 14, 2025]
§ 1.6012-1
Individuals required to make returns of income.
(a)
Individual citizen or resident
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, an income tax return must be filed by every individual for each taxable year beginning before January 1, 1973, during which he receives $600 or more of gross income, and for each taxable year beginning after December 31, 1972, during which he receives $750 or more of gross income, if such individual is:
(i) A citizen of the United States, whether residing at home or abroad,
(ii) A resident of the United States even though not a citizen thereof, or
(iii) An alien bona fide resident of Puerto Rico or any section 931 possession, as defined in § 1.931-1(c)(1), during the entire taxable year
(2)
Special rules.
(i) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, an individual who is described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and who has attained the age of 65 before the close of his taxable year must file an income tax return only if he receives $1,200 or more of gross income during his taxable year.
(ii) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and before January 1, 1973, an individual described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (other than an individual referred to in section 142(b)):
(
a
) Who is not married (as determined by applying section 143(a) and the regulations thereunder) must file an income tax return only if he receives $1,700 or more of gross income during his taxable year, except that if such an individual has attained the age of 65 before the close of his taxable year an income tax return must be filed by such individual only if he receives $2,300 or more of gross income during his taxable year.
(
b
) Who is entitled to make a joint return under section 6013 and the regulations thereunder must file an income tax return only if his gross income received during his taxable year, when combined with the gross income of his spouse received during his taxable year, is $2,300 or more. However, if such individual or his spouse has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year an income tax return must be filed by such individual only if their combined gross income is $2,900 or more. If both the individual and his spouse have attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year such return must be filed only if their combined gross income is $3,500 or more. However, this subdivision (ii)(
b
) shall not apply if the individual and his spouse did not have the same household as their home at the close of their taxable year, if such spouse files a separate return for a taxable year which includes any part of such individual's taxable year, or if any other taxpayer is entitled to an exemption for such individual or his spouse under section 151(e) for such other taxpayer's taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which such individual's taxable year begins. For example, a married student more than half of whose support is furnished by his father must file an income tax return if he receives $600 or more of gross income during his taxable year.
(iii) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1972, an individual described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (other than an individual referred to in section 142(b)):
(
a
) Who is not married (as determined by applying section 143(a) and the regulations thereunder) must file an income tax return only if he receives $1,750 or more of gross income during his taxable year, except that if such an individual has attained the age of 65 before the close of his taxable year an income tax return must be filed by such individual only if he receives $2,500 or more of gross income during his taxable year.
(
b
) Who is entitled to make a joint return under section 6013 and the regulations thereunder must file an income tax return only if his gross income received during his taxable year, when combined with the gross income of his spouse received during his taxable
year, is $2,500 or more. However, if such individual or his spouse has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year an income tax return must be filed by such individual only if their combined gross income is $3,250 or more. If both the individual and his spouse attain the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year such return must be filed only if their combined gross income is $4,000 or more. However, this subdivision (iii)(
b
) shall not apply if the individual and his spouse did not have the same household as their home at the close of their taxable year, if such spouse files a separate return for a taxable year which includes any part of such individual's taxable year, or if any other taxpayer is entitled to an exemption for the taxpayer or his spouse under section 151(e) for such other taxpayer's taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which such individual's taxable year begins. For example, a married student more than half of whose support is furnished by his father must file an income tax return if he receives $750 or more of gross income during the taxable year.
(iv) For purposes of section 6012(a)(1)(A)(ii) and subdivisions (ii)(
b
) and (iii)(
b
) of this subparagraph, an individual and his spouse are considered to have the same household as their home at the close of a taxable year if the same household constituted the principal place of abode of both the individual and his spouse at the close of such taxable year (or on the date of death, if the individual or his spouse died within the taxable year). The individual and his spouse will be considered to have the same household as their home at the close of the taxable year notwithstanding a temporary absence from the household due to special circumstances, as, for example, in the case of a nonpermanent failure on the part of the individual and his spouse to have a common abode by reason of illness, education, business, vacation, or military service. For example, A, a calendar-year individual under 65 years of age, is married to B, also under 65 years of age, and is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States. During 1970 A is transferred to an overseas base. A and B give up their home, which they had jointly occupied until that time; B moves to the home of her parents for the duration of A's absence. They fully intend to set up a new joint household upon A's return. Neither A nor B must file a return for 1970 if their combined gross income for the year is less than $2,300 and if no other taxpayer is entitled to a dependency exemption for A or B under section 151(e).
(v) In the case of a short taxable year referred to in section 443(a)(1), an individual described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall file an income tax return if his gross income received during such short taxable year equals or exceeds his own personal exemption allowed by section 151(b) (prorated as provided in section 443(c)) and, when applicable, his additional exemption for age 65 or more allowed by section 151(c)(1) (prorated as provided in section 443(c)).
(vi) For rules relating to returns required to be made by every individual who is liable for one or more qualified State individual income taxes, as defined in section 6362, for a taxable year, see paragraph (b) of § 301.6361-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
(vii) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978, an individual who receives payments during the calendar year in which the taxable year begins under section 3507 (relating to advance payment of earned income credit) must file an income tax return.
(viii) For rules relating to returns required of taxpayers who receive advance payments of the premium tax credit under section 36B, see § 1.6011-8(a).
(3)
Earned income from without the United States and gain from sale of residence.
For the purpose of determining whether an income tax return must be filed for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, gross income shall be computed without regard to the exclusion provided for in section 911 (relating to earned income from sources without the United States). For the purpose of determining whether an income tax return must be filed for any taxable year ending after December 31, 1963, gross income shall be computed without regard to the exclusion provided for in section 121 (relating to sale of residence by individual
who has attained age 65). In the case of an individual claiming an exclusion under section 121, he shall attach Form 2119 to the return required under this paragraph and in the case of an individual claiming an exclusion under section 911, he shall attach Form 2555 to the return required under this paragraph.
(4)
Return of income of minor.
A minor is subject to the same requirements and elections for making returns of income as are other individuals. Thus, for example, for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1972, a return must be made by or for a minor who has an aggregate of $1,750 of gross income from funds held in trust for him and from his personal services, regardless of the amount of his taxable income. The return of a minor must be made by the minor himself or must be made for him by his guardian or other person charged with the care of the minor's person or property. See paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.6012-3. See § 1.73-1 for inclusion in the minor's gross income of amounts received for his personal services. For the amount of tax which is considered to have been properly assessed against the parent, if not paid by the child, see section 6201(c) and paragraph (c) of § 301.6201-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
(5)
Returns made by agents.
The return of income may be made by an agent if, by reason of disease or injury, the person liable for the making of the return is unable to make it. The return may also be made by an agent if the taxpayer is unable to make the return by reason of continuous absence from the United States (including Puerto Rico as if a part of the United States) for a period of at least 60 days prior to the date prescribed by law for making the return. In addition, a return may be made by an agent if the taxpayer requests permission, in writing, of the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the legal residence or principal place of business of the person liable for the making of the return, and such district director determines that good cause exists for permitting the return to be so made. However, assistance in the preparation of the return may be rendered under any circumstances. Whenever a return is made by an agent it must be accompanied by a power of attorney (or copy thereof) authorizing him to represent his principal in making, executing, or filing the return. A form 2848, when properly completed, is sufficient. In addition, where one spouse is physically unable by reason of disease or injury to sign a joint return, the other spouse may, with the oral consent of the one who is incapacitated, sign the incapacitated spouse's name in the proper place on the return followed by the words “By __________ Husband (or Wife),” and by the signature of the signing spouse in his own right, provided that a dated statement signed by the spouse who is signing the return is attached to and made a part of the return stating:
(i) The name of the return being filed,
(ii) The taxable year,
(iii) The reason for the inability of the spouse who is incapacitated to sign the return, and
(iv) That the spouse who is incapacitated consented to the signing of the return.
The taxpayer and his agent, if any, are responsible for the return as made and incur liability for the penalties provided for erroneous, false, or fraudulent returns.
(6)
Form of return.
Form 1040 is prescribed for general use in making the return required under this paragraph. Form 1040A is an optional short form which, in accordance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section, may be used by certain taxpayers. A taxpayer otherwise entitled to use Form 1040A as his return for any taxable year may not make his return on such form if he elects not to take the standard deduction provided in section 141, and in such case he must make his return on Form 1040. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, a taxpayer entitled under section 6014 and § 1.6014-1 to elect not to show his tax on his return must, if he desires to exercise such election, make his return on Form 1040A. Form 1040W is an optional short form which, in accordance with paragraph (a)(8) of this section, may be used only with respect to taxable years
beginning after December 31, 1958, and ending before December 31, 1961.
(7)(i)
Use of Form 1040A.
Form 1040A may be filed only by those individuals entitled to use such form as provided by and in accordance with the instructions for such form.
(ii)
Computation and payment of tax.
Unless a taxpayer is entitled to elect under section 6014 and § 1.6014-1 not to show the tax on Form 1040A and does so elect, he shall compute and show on his return on Form 1040A the amount of the tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code and shall, without notice and demand therefor, pay any unpaid balance of such tax not later than the date fixed for filing the return.
(iii)
Change of election to use Form 1040A.
A taxpayer who has elected to make his return on Form 1040A may change such election. Such change of election shall be within the time and subject to the conditions prescribed in section 144(b) and § 1.144-2 relating to change of election to take, or not to take the standard deduction.
(8)
Use of Form 1040W for certain taxable years
—(i)
In general.
An individual may use Form 1040W as his return for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958, and ending before December 31, 1961, in which the gross income of the individual, regardless of the amount thereof:
(
a
) Consists entirely of remuneration for personal services performed as an employee (whether or not such remuneration constitutes wages as defined in section 3401(a)), dividends, or interest, and
(
b
) Does not include more than $200 from dividends and interest.
For purposes of determining whether gross income from dividends and interest exceeds $200, dividends from domestic corporations are taken into account to the extent that they are includible in gross income. For purposes of this subparagraph, any reference to Form 1040 in §§ 1.4-2, 1.142-1, and 1.144-1 and this section shall also be deemed a reference to Form 1040W.
(ii)
Change of election to use Form 1040W.
A taxpayer who has elected to make his return on Form 1040W may change such election. Such change of election shall be within the time and subject to the conditions prescribed in section 144(b) and § 1.144-2, relating to change of election to take, or not to take, the standard deduction.
(iii)
Joint return of husband and wife on Form 1040W.
A husband and wife, eligible under section 6013 and the regulations thereunder to file a joint return for the taxable year, may, subject to the provisions of this subparagraph, make a joint return on Form 1040W for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958, and ending before December 31, 1961, in which the aggregate gross income of the spouses (regardless of amount) consists entirely of remuneration for personal services performed as an employee (whether or not such remuneration constitutes wages as defined in section 3401(a)), dividends, or interest, and does not include more than $200 from dividends and interest. For purposes of determining whether gross income from sources to which the $200 limitation applies exceeds such amount in cases where both spouses receive dividends from domestic corporations, the amount of such dividends received by each spouse is taken into account to the extent that such dividends are includible in gross income. See section 116 and §§ 1.116-1 and 1.116-2. If a joint return is made by husband and wife on Form 1040W, the liability for the tax shall be joint and several.
(9)
Items of tax preference.
For a taxable year ending after December 31, 1969, an individual shall attach Form 4625 to the return required by this paragraph if during the year the individual:
(i) Has items of tax preference (described in section 57) in excess of its minimum tax exemption (determined under § 1.58-1) or
(ii) Uses a net operating loss carryover from a prior taxable year in which it deferred minimum tax under section 56(b).
(b)
Return of nonresident alien individual
—(1)
Requirement of return
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, every nonresident alien individual (other than one treated as a resident under section 6013 (g) or (h)) who is engaged in trade or business in the United States at any time during the taxable year or who has income which is subject to taxation under subtitle A
of the Code shall make a return on Form 1040NR. For this purpose it is immaterial that the gross income for the taxable year is less than the minimum amount specified in section 6012(a) for making a return. Thus, a nonresident alien individual who is engaged in a trade or business in the United States at any time during the taxable year is required to file a return on Form 1040 NR even though (
a
) he has no income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, (
b
) he has no income from sources within the United States, or (
c
) his income is exempt from income tax by reason of an income tax convention or any section of the Code. However, if the nonresident alien individual has no gross income for the taxable year, he is not required to complete the return schedules but must attach a statement to the return indicating the nature of any exclusions claimed and the amount of such exclusions to the extent such amounts are readily determinable.
(ii)
Treaty income.
If the gross income of a nonresident alien individual includes treaty income, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.871-12, a statement shall be attached to the return on Form 1040NR showing with respect to that income:
(
a
) The amounts of tax withheld,
(
b
) The names and post office addresses of withholding agents, and
(
c
) Such other information as may be required by the return form, or by the instructions issued with respect to the form, to show the taxpayer's entitlement to the reduced rate of tax under the tax convention.
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
Return not required when tax is fully paid at source.
A nonresident alien individual (other than one treated as a resident under section 6013 (g) or (h)) who at no time during the taxable year is engaged in a trade or business in the United States is not required to make a return for the taxable year if his tax liability for the taxable year is fully satisfied by the withholding of tax at source under chapter 3 of the Code. This subdivision does not apply to a nonresident alien individual who has income for the taxable year which is treated under section 871 (c) or (d) and § 1.871-9 (relating to students or trainees) or § 1.871-10 (relating to real property income) as income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that individual, or to a nonresident alien individual making a claim under § 301.6402-3 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations) for the refund of an overpayment of tax for the taxable year. In addition, this subdivision does not apply to a nonresident alien individual who has income for the taxable year that is treated under section 871(b)(1) as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by reason of the operation of section 897. For purposes of this subdivision, some of the items of income from sources within the United States upon which the tax liability will not have been fully satisfied by the withholding of tax at source under chapter 3 of the Code are:
(
a
) Interest upon so-called tax-free covenant bonds upon which, in accordance with section 1451 and § 1.1451-1, a tax of only 2 percent is required to be withheld at the source,
(
b
) In the case of bonds or other evidences of indebtedness issued after September 28, 1965, amounts described in section 871(a)(1)(C),
(
c
) Capital gains described in section 871(a)(2) and paragraph (d) of § 1.871-7, and
(
d
) Accrued interest received in connection with the sale of bonds between interest dates, which, in accordance with paragraph (h) of § 1.1441-4, is not subject to withholding of tax at the source.
(ii)
Return of individual for taxable year of change of U.S. citizenship or residence
—(
a
) If an alien individual becomes a citizen or resident of the United States during the taxable year and is a citizen or resident of the United States on the last day of such year, he must make a return on Form 1040 for the taxable year. However, a separate schedule is required to be attached to this return to show the income tax computation for the part of the taxable year during which the alien was neither a citizen nor resident of the United States, unless an election under section 6013 (g) or (h) is in effect
for the alien. A Form 1040NR, clearly marked “Statement” across the top, may be used as such a separate schedule.
(
b
) If an individual abandons his U.S. citizenship or residence during the taxable year and is not a citizen or resident of the United States on the last day of such year, he must make a return on Form 1040NR for the taxable year, even if an election under section 6013(g) was in effect for the taxable year preceding the year of abandonment. However, a separate schedule is required to be attached to this return to show the income tax computation for the part of the taxable year during which the individual was a citizen or resident of the United States. A Form 1040, clearly marked “Statement” across the top, may be used as such a separate schedule.
(
c
) A return is required under this subdivision (ii) only if the individual is otherwise required to make a return for the taxable year.
(iii)
Beneficiaries of estates or trusts.
A nonresident alien individual who is a beneficiary of an estate or trust which is engaged in trade or business in the United States is not required to make a return for the taxable year merely because he is deemed to be engaged in trade or business within the United States under section 875(2). However, such nonresident alien beneficiary will be required to make a return if he otherwise satisfies the conditions of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph for making a return.
(iv)
Certain alien residents of Puerto Rico.
This paragraph does not apply to a nonresident alien individual who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico during the taxable year. See section 876 and paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
(3)
Representative or agent for nonresident alien individual
—(i)
Cases where power of attorney is not required.
The responsible representative or agent within the United States of a nonresident alien individual shall make on behalf of his nonresident alien principal a return of, and shall pay the tax on, all income coming within his control as representative or agent which is subject to the income tax under subtitle A of the Code. The agency appointment will determine how completely the agent is substituted for the principal for tax purposes. Any person who collects interest or dividends on deposited securities of a nonresident alien individual, executes ownership certificates in connection therewith, or sells such securities under special instructions shall not be deemed merely by reason of such acts to be the responsible representative or agent of the nonresident alien individual. If the responsible representative or agent does not have a specific power of attorney from the nonresident alien individual to file a return in his behalf, the return shall be accompanied by a statement to the effect that the representative or agent does not possess specific power of attorney to file a return for such individual but that the return is being filed in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision.
(ii)
Cases where power of attorney is required.
Whenever a return of income of a nonresident alien individual is made by an agent acting under a duly authorized power of attorney for that purpose, the return shall be accompanied by the power of attorney in proper form, or a copy thereof, specifically authorizing him to represent his principal in making, executing, and filing the income tax return. Form 2848 may be used for this purpose. The agent, as well as the taxpayer, may incur liability for the penalties provided for erroneous, false, or fraudulent returns. For the requirements regarding signing of returns, see § 1.6061-1. The rules of paragraph (e) of § 601.504 of this chapter (Statement of Procedural Rules) shall apply under this subparagraph in determining whether a copy of a power of attorney must be certified.
(iii)
Limitation.
A return of income shall be required under this subparagraph only if the nonresident alien individual is otherwise required to make a return in accordance with this paragraph.
(4)
Disallowance of deductions and credits.
For provisions disallowing deductions and credits when a return of income has not been filed by or on behalf of a nonresident alien individual, see section 874(a) and the regulations thereunder.
(5)
Effective date.
This paragraph shall apply for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 1966, except that it shall not be applied to require (i) the filing of a return for any taxable year ending before January 1, 1974, which, pursuant to instructions applicable to the return, is not required to be filed or (ii) the amendment of a return for such a taxable year which, pursuant to such instructions, is required to be filed. For corresponding rules applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see 26 CFR 1.6012-1(b) (Revised as of January 1, 1967).

§ 1.6012-2
Corporations required to make returns of income.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Requirement of return.
Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (g)(1) of this section with respect to charitable and other organizations having unrelated business income and to certain foreign corporations, respectively, every corporation, as defined in section 7701(a)(3), subject to taxation under subtitle A of the Code shall make a return of income regardless of whether it has taxable income or regardless of the amount of its gross income.
(2)
Existence of corporation.
A corporation in existence during any portion of a taxable year is required to make a return. If a corporation was not in existence throughout an annual accounting period (either calendar year or fiscal year), the corporation is required to make a return for that fractional part of a year during which it was in existence. A corporation is not in existence after it ceases business and dissolves, retaining no assets, whether or not under State law it may thereafter be treated as continuing as a corporation for certain limited purposes connected with winding up its affairs, such as for the purpose of suing and being sued. If the corporation has valuable claims for which it will bring suit during this period, it has retained assets and therefore continues in existence. A corporation does not go out of existence if it is turned over to receivers or trustees who continue to operate it. If a corporation has received a charter but has never perfected its organization and has transacted no business and has no income from any source, it may upon presentation of the facts to the district director be relieved from the necessity of making a return. In the absence of a proper showing of such facts to the district director, a corporation will be required to make a return.
(3)
Form of return.
The return required of a corporation under this section shall be made on Form 1120 unless the corporation is a type for which a special form is prescribed. The special forms of returns and schedules required of particular types of corporations are set forth in paragraphs (b) to (g), inclusive, of this section.

Disclosure of uncertain tax positions.
A corporation required to make a return under this section shall attach Schedule UTP, Uncertain Tax Position Statement, or any successor form, to such return, in accordance with forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance provided by the IRS.

A personal holding company, as defined in section 542, including a foreign corporation within the definition of such section, shall attach Schedule PH, Computation of U.S. Personal Holding Company Tax, to the return required by paragraph (a) or (g), as the case may be, of this section.

Mutual savings banks.
Mutual savings banks conducting life insurance business and meeting the requirements of section 594 are subject to partial tax computed on Form 1120, “U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return,” and partial tax computed on Form 1120-L.

(2)
Domestic nonlife insurance companies.
Every domestic insurance company other than a life insurance company shall make a return on Form 1120-PC, “U.S. Property and Casualty Insurance Company Income Tax Return.” This includes organizations described in section 501(m)(1) that provide commercial-type insurance and organizations described in section 833. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, such company shall file with its return a copy of its annual statement (or a pro forma annual statement), including the underwriting and investment exhibit (or any successor thereto) for the year covered by such return.
(3)
Foreign insurance companies.
The provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section concerning the returns and statements of insurance companies subject to tax under section 801 or section 831 also apply to foreign insurance companies subject to tax under those sections, except that the copy of the annual statement required to be submitted with the return shall, in the case of a foreign insurance company that is not required to file an annual statement, be a copy of the pro forma annual statement relating to the United States business of such company.
(4)
Special rule for insurance companies filing their Federal income tax returns electronically.
If an insurance company described in paragraph (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section files its Federal income tax return electronically, it must include on or with such return its annual statement (or pro forma annual statement), or a portion thereof, as and to the extent required by forms or instructions. If the full annual statement is not required to be included with the return, such statement must be available at all times for inspection by authorized Internal Revenue Service officers or employees and retained for so long as such statements may be material in the administration of any internal revenue law. See § 1.6001-1(e).
(5)
Definition.

The filing of a return of unrelated business income does not relieve the organization of the duty of filing other required returns.
(f)

—(1)
In general.
For taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2007, a cooperative organization described in section 1381 (including a farmers' cooperative exempt from tax under section 521) is required to make a return, whether or not it has taxable income and regardless of the amount of its gross income, on Form 1120-C, “U.S. Income Tax Return for Cooperative Associations,” or such other form as may be designated by the Commissioner.
(2)
Farmers' cooperatives.

farmers' cooperative that is not exempt from tax under section 521) is required to make a return on Form 990-C, “Farmers' Cooperative Association Income Tax Return.”
(3)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (f) is applicable on or after July 30, 2007.
(g)
Returns by foreign corporations
—(1)
Requirement of return
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, every foreign corporation which is engaged in trade or business in the United States at any time during the taxable year or which has income which is subject to taxation under subtitle A of the Code (relating to income taxes) shall make a return on Form 1120-F. Thus, for example, a foreign corporation which is engaged in trade or business in the United States at any time during the taxable year is required to file a return on Form 1120-F even though (
a
) it has no income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, (
b
) it has no income from sources within the United States, or (
c
) its income is exempt from income tax by reason of an income tax convention or any section of the Code. However, if the foreign corporation has no gross income for the taxable year, it is not required to complete the return schedules but must attach a statement to the return indicating the nature of any exclusions claimed and the amount of such exclusions to the extent such amounts are readily determinable.
(ii)
Treaty income.
If the gross income of a foreign corporation includes treaty income, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.871-12, a statement shall be attached to the return on Form 1120-F showing with respect to that income:
(
a
) The amounts of tax withheld,
(
b
) The names and post office addresses of withholding agents, and
(
c
) Such other information as may be required by the return form or by the instructions issued with respect to the form, to show the taxpayer's entitlement to the reduced rate of tax under the tax convention.
(iii)
Balance sheet and reconciliation of income.
At the election of the taxpayer, the balance sheets and reconciliation of income, as shown on Form 1120-F, may be limited to:
(
a
) The assets of the corporation located in the United States and to its other assets used in the trade or business conducted in the United States, and

—(
a
)
In general.
A foreign corporation which at no time during the taxable year is engaged in a trade or business in the United States is not required to make a return for the taxable year if its tax liability for the taxable year is fully satisfied by the withholding of tax at source under chapter 3 of the Code. For purposes of this subdivision, some of the items of income from sources within the United States upon which the tax liability will not have been fully satisfied by the withholding of tax at source under chapter 3 of the Code are:

(
2
) In the case of bonds or other evidence of indebtedness issued after September 25, 1965, amounts described in section 881(a)(3),

This subdivision (i) shall not apply:
(

) To a foreign corporation which has income for the taxable year which is treated under section 882(d) or (e) and § 1.882-2 as income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation,
(
2
) To a foreign corporation making a claim under § 301.6402-3 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations) for the refund of an overpayment of tax for the taxable year, or
(
3
) To a foreign corporation described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of § 1.532-1 whose
accumulated taxable income for the taxable year is determined under paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.535-1.
(ii)
Beneficiaries of estates or trusts.
A foreign corporation which is a beneficiary of an estate or trust which is engaged in trade or business in the United States is not required to make a return for the taxable year merely because it is deemed to be engaged in trade or business within the United States under section 875(2). However, such foreign corporation will be required to make a return if it otherwise satisfies the conditions of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph for making a return.
(iii)
Special returns and schedules.
The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section shall apply to a foreign corporation except that a foreign corporation which is an insurance company to which paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies shall make a return on Form 1120-F and not on Form 1120. If a foreign corporation which is an insurance company to which paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section applies has income for the taxable year from sources within the United States which is not effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation, the corporation shall attach to its return on Form 1120L or 1120M, as the case may be, a separate schedule showing the nature and amount of the items of such income, the rate of tax applicable thereto, and the amount of tax withheld therefrom under chapter 3 of the Code.

The responsible representative or agent within the United States of a foreign corporation shall make on behalf of his principal a return of, and shall pay the tax on, all income coming within his control as representative or agent which is subject to the income tax under subtitle A of the Code. The agency appointment will determine how completely the agent is substituted for the principal for tax purposes. Any person who collects interest or dividends on deposited securities of a foreign corporation, executes ownership certificates in connection therewith, or sells such securities under special instructions shall not be deemed merely by reason of such acts to be the responsible representative or agent of the foreign corporation. If the responsible representative or agent does not have a specific power of attorney from the foreign corporation to file a return in its behalf, the return shall be accompanied by a statement to the effect that the representative or agent does not possess specific power of attorney to file a return for such corporation but that the return is being filed in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision.
(ii)
Cases where power of attorney is required.
Whenever a return of income of a foreign corporation is made by an agent acting under a duly authorized power of attorney for that purpose, the return shall be accompanied by the power of attorney in proper form, or a copy thereof specifically authorizing him to represent his principal in making, executing, and filing the income tax return.

perjury that it is a true and complete copy, shall be filed together with a statement by the fiduciary indicating the provisions of the will or trust instrument (including any amendments) which, in the fiduciary's opinion, determine the extent to which the income of the estate or trust is taxable to the estate or trust, the beneficiaries, or the grantor, respectively.
(3)
Domiciliary and ancillary representatives.
In the case of an estate required to file a return under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, having both domiciliary and ancillary representatives, the domiciliary and ancillary representatives must each file a return on Form 1041. The domiciliary representative is required to include in the return rendered by him as such domiciliary representative the entire income of the estate. The return of the ancillary representative shall be filed with the district director for his internal revenue district and shall show the name and address of the domiciliary representative, the amount of gross income received by the ancillary representative, and the deductions to be claimed against such income, including any amount of income properly paid or credited by the ancillary representative to any legatee, heir, or other beneficiary. If the ancillary representative for the estate of a nonresident alien is a citizen or resident of the United States, and the domiciliary representative is a nonresident alien, such ancillary representative is required to render the return otherwise required of the domiciliary representative.
(4)
Two or more trusts.
A trustee of two or more trusts must make a separate return for each trust, even though such trusts were created by the same grantor for the same beneficiary or beneficiaries.
(5)
Trusts with unrelated business income.
Every fiduciary for a trust described in section 511(b)(2) which is subject to the tax imposed on its unrelated business taxable income by section 511(b)(1) shall make a return on Form 990-T for each taxable year if the trust has gross income, included in computing unrelated business taxable income for such taxable year, of $1,000 or more. The filing of a return of unrelated business income does not relieve the fiduciary of such trust from the duty of filing other required returns.
(6)
Charitable remainder trusts.
Every fiduciary for a charitable remainder annuity trust (as defined in § 1.664-2) or a charitable remainder unitrust (as defined in § 1.664-3) shall make a return on Form 1041-B for each taxable year of the trust even though it is nonexempt because it has unrelated business taxable income. The return on Form 1041-B shall be made in accordance with the instructions for the form and shall be filed with the designated Internal Revenue office on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year of the trust. A copy of the instrument governing the trust, accompanied by a written declaration of the fiduciary under the penalties of perjury that it is a true and complete copy, shall be attached to the return for the first taxable year of the trust.
(7)
Certain trusts described in section 4947(a)(1).
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980, in the case of a trust described in section 4947(a)(1) which has no taxable income for a taxable year, the filing requirements of section 6012 and this section shall be satisfied by the filing, pursuant to § 53.6011-1 of this chapter (Foundation Excise Tax Regulations) and § 1.6033-2(a), by the fiduciary of such trust of—
(i) Form 990-PF if such trust is treated as a private foundation, or
(ii) Form 990 if such trust is not treated as a private foundation.
When the provisions of this paragraph (a)(7) are met, the fiduciary shall not be required to file Form 1041.
(8)
Estate and trusts liable for qualified tax.
In the case of an estate or trust which is liable for one or more qualified State individual income taxes, as defined in section 6362, for a taxable year, see paragraph (b) of § 301.6361-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) for rules relating to returns required to be made.
(9)
A trust any portion of which is treated as owned by the grantor or another person pursuant to sections 671 through 678.
In the case of a trust any portion of which is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under the provisions of subpart E (section 671 and following) part I, subchapter J,
chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code see § 1.671-4.
(10)
Hospital organizations organized as trusts with noncompliant hospital facilities.
Every fiduciary for a hospital organization (as defined in § 1.501(r)-1(b)(18)) organized as a trust described in section 511(b)(2) that is subject to the tax imposed by § 1.501(r)-2(d) shall make a return on Form 990-T. The filing of a return to pay the tax described in § 1.501(r)-2(d) does not relieve the organization of the duty of filing other required returns.
(b)
For other persons
—(1)
Decedents.
The executor or administrator of the estate of a decedent, or other person charged with the property of a decedent, shall make the return of income required in respect of such decedent. For the decedent's taxable year which ends with the date of his death, the return shall cover the period during which he was alive. For the filing of returns of income for citizens and alien residents of the United States, and alien residents of Puerto Rico, see paragraph (a) of § 1.6012-1. For the filing of a joint return after death of spouse, see paragraph (d) of § 1.6013-1.
(2)
Nonresident alien individuals
—(i)
In general.
A resident or domestic fiduciary or other person charged with the care of the person or property of a nonresident alien individual shall make a return for that individual and pay the tax unless:
(
a
) The nonresident alien individual makes a return of, and pays the tax on, his income for the taxable year,
(
b
) A responsible representative or agent in the United States of the nonresident alien individual makes a return of, and pays the tax on, the income of such alien individual for the taxable year, or
(
c
) The nonresident alien individual has appointed a person in the United States to act as his agent for the purpose of making a return of income and, if such fiduciary is required to file a Form 1041 for an estate or trust of which such alien individual is a beneficiary, such fiduciary attaches a copy of the agency appointment to his return on Form 1041.
(ii)
Income to be returned.
A return of income shall be required under this subparagraph only if the nonresident alien individual is otherwise required to make a return in accordance with paragraph (b) of § 1.6012-1. The provisions of that paragraph shall apply in determining the form of return to be used and the income to be returned.
(iii)
Disallowance of deductions and credits.
For provisions disallowing deductions and credits when a return of income has not been filed by or on behalf of a nonresident alien individual, see section 874 and the regulations thereunder.
(iv)
Alien resident of Puerto Rico.
This subparagraph shall not apply to the return of a nonresident alien individual who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico during the entire taxable year. See § 1.876-1.
(v)
Cross reference.
For requirements of withholding tax at source on nonresident alien individuals and of returns with respect to such withheld taxes, see §§ 1.1441-1 to 1.1465-1, inclusive.
(3)
Persons under a disability.
A fiduciary acting as the guardian of a minor, or as the guardian or committee of an insane person, must make the return of income required in respect of such person unless, in the case of a minor, the minor himself makes the return or causes it to be made.
(4)
Corporations.
A receiver, trustee in dissolution, trustee in bankruptcy, or assignee, who, by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, by operation of law or otherwise, has possession of or holds title to all or substantially all the property or business of a corporation, shall make the return of income for such corporation in the same manner and form as corporations are required to make such returns. Such return shall be filed whether or not the receiver, trustee, or assignee is operating the property or business of the corporation. A receiver in charge of only a small part of the property of a corporation, such as a receiver in mortgage foreclosure proceedings involving merely a small portion of its property, need not make the return of income. See also § 1.6041-1, relating to returns regarding information at source; §§ 1.6042-1 to 1.6042-3, inclusive, relating to returns regarding payments of dividends; §§ 1.6044-1 to 1.6044-4, inclusive, relating to returns regarding payments
of patronage dividends; and §§ 1.6049-1 and 1.6049-2, relating to returns regarding certain payments of interest.
(5)
Individuals in receivership.
A receiver who stands in the place of an individual must make the return of income required in respect of such individual. A receiver of only part of the property of an individual need not file a return, and the individual must make his own return.
(c)
Joint fiduciaries.
In the case of joint fiduciaries, a return is required to be made by only one of such fiduciaries. A return made by one of joint fiduciaries shall contain a statement that the fiduciary has sufficient knowledge of the affairs of the person for whom the return is made to enable him to make the return, and that the return is, to the best of his knowledge and belief, true and correct.
(d)
Other provisions.
For the definition of the term “fiduciary”, see section 7701(a)(6) and the regulations thereunder. For information returns required to be made by fiduciaries under section 6041, see § 1.6041-1. As to further duties and liabilities of fiduciaries, see section 6903 and § 301.6903-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).

For the convenience of the user §§ 16.15 and 17.16 of 26 CFR (1939) are set forth below:
§ 16.15 Annual reports for income taxable years.
(a)
General requirements.
Every contracting party completing a contract or subcontract within the contracting party's income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939 shall file with the district director of internal revenue for the internal revenue district in which the contracting party's Federal income tax returns are required to be filed an annual report on the prescribed form of the profit and excess profit on all contracts and subcontracts coming within the scope of the act and the regulations in this part and completed within the particular income-taxable year. There shall be included as a part of such a report a statement, preferably in columnar form, showing separately for each such contract or subcontract completed by the contracting party within the income-taxable year the total contract price, the cost of performing the contract or subcontract and the resulting profit or loss on each contract or subcontract together with a summary statement showing in detail the computation of the net profit or net loss upon all contracts and subcontracts completed within the income-taxable year and the amount of the excess profit, if any, for the income-taxable year covered by the report. A copy of the report made to the Secretary of the Army (see § 16.14) with respect to each contract or subcontract covered in the annual report, shall be filed as a part of such annual report. In case the income-taxable year of the contracting party is a period of less than twelve months (see § 16.1), the report required by this section shall be made for such period and not for a full year.
(b)
Time for filing annual reports.
Annual reports of contracts and subcontracts coming within the scope of the act and the regulations in this part completed by a contracting party within an income-taxable year must be filed on or before the 15th day of the ninth month following the close of the contracting party's income-taxable year. It is important that the contracting party render on or before the due date an annual report as nearly complete and final as it is possible for the contracting party to prepare. An extension of time granted the contracting party for filing its Federal income tax return does not serve to extend the time for filing the annual report required by this section. Authority consistent with authorizations for granting extensions of time for filing Federal income
tax returns is hereby delegated to the various collectors of internal revenue for granting extensions of time for filing the reports required by this section. Application for extensions of time for filing such reports should be addressed to the district director of internal revenue for the district in which the contracting party files its Federal income tax returns and must contain a full recital of the causes for the delay.
§ 17.16 Annual reports for income-taxable years.
(a)
General requirements.
Every contracting party completing a contract or subcontract within the contracting party's income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939 shall file, with the district director of internal revenue for the internal revenue district in which the contracting party's Federal income tax return is required to be filed, annual reports on the prescribed forms of the profit and excess profit on all contracts and subcontracts coming within the scope of the act. If any contracts or subcontracts so completed by the contracting party were entered into for the construction or manufacture of any complete naval vessel or any portion thereof, the profit and excess profit on all such contracts and subcontracts completed within the income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939 shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of § 17.6. If any contracts or subcontracts so completed by the contracting party were entered into for the construction or manufacture of any complete naval aircraft or any portion thereof, the profit and excess profit on all such contracts and subcontracts completed within the income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939 shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of § 17.7. There shall be included as a part of the annual report a statement, preferably in columnar form, showing separately for each contract or subcontract completed by the contracting party within the income-taxable year and covered by the report, the total contract price, the cost of performing the contract or subcontract and resulting profit or loss on each contract or subcontract together with a summary statement showing in detail the computation of the net profit or net loss upon each group of contracts and subcontracts covered by the report and the amount of the excess profit, if any, with respect to each group of contracts and subcontracts covered by the report. A copy of the report made to the Secretary of the Navy (see § 17.15) with respect to each contract or subcontract covered in the annual report, shall be filed as a part of such annual report. In case the income-taxable year of the contracting party is a period of less than twelve months (see § 17.1), the reports required by this section shall be made for such period and not for a full year.
(b)
Time for filing annual reports.
Annual reports of contracts and subcontracts completed by a contracting party within an income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939 shall be filed on or before the 15th day of the ninth month following the close of the contracting party's income-taxable year. It is important that the contracting party render on or before the due date annual reports as nearly complete and final as it is possible for the contracting party to prepare. An extension of time granted the contracting party for filing its Federal income tax return does not serve to extend the time for filing the annual reports required by this section. Authority consistent with authorizations for granting extensions of time for filing Federal income tax returns is hereby delegated to the various district directors of internal revenue for granting extensions of time for filing the reports required by this section. Application for extension of time for filing such reports should be addressed to the district director of internal revenue for the district in which the contracting party files its Federal income tax returns and must contain a full recital of the causes for the delay.
§ 1.6012-5
Composite return in lieu of specified form.
The Commissioner may authorize the use, at the option of a person required to make a return, of a composite return in lieu of any form specified in this part for use by such a person, subject to such conditions, limitations, and special rules governing the preparation, execution, filing, and correction thereof as the Commissioner may deem appropriate. Such composite return shall consist of a form prescribed by the Commissioner and an attachment or attachments of magnetic tape or other approved media. Notwithstanding any provisions in this part to the contrary, a single form and attachment may comprise the returns of more than one such person. To the extent that the use of a composite return has been authorized by the Commissioner, references in this part to a specific form for use by such a person shall be deemed to refer also to a composite return under this section.
[T.D. 7200, 37 FR 16544, Aug. 16, 1972]
§ 1.6012-6
Returns by political organizations.
(a)
Requirement of return
—(1)
In general.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1974, every political organization described in section 527(e)(1),
and every fund described in section 527(f)(3) or section 527(g), and every organization described in section 501(c) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) shall, if a tax is imposed on such an organization or fund by section 527(b), make a return of income on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year.
(2)
Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, and before January 1, 1975.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, and before January 1, 1975, any political organization which would be described in section 527(e)(1) if such section applied to such years shall not be required to make a return if such organization would not be required to make a return under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b)
Form of return.
The return required by an organization or fund upon which a tax is imposed by section 527(b) shall be made on Form 1120-POL.
(c)
Applicability date.
This section applies to returns filed on or after January 30, 2020. Section 1.6012-6T (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2019) applies to returns filed before January 30, 2020.
[T.D. 7516, 42 FR 57312, Nov. 2, 1977; 43 FR 2721, Jan. 19, 1978; T.D. 9821, 82 FR 33444, July 20, 2017; T.D. 9892, 85 FR 5324, Jan. 30, 2020]
§ 1.6013-1
Joint returns.
(a)
In general.
(1) A husband and wife may elect to make a joint return under section 6013(a) even though one of the spouses has no gross income or deductions. For rules for determining whether individuals occupy the status of husband and wife for purposes of filing a joint return, see paragraph (a) of § 1.6013-4. For any taxable year with respect to which a joint return has been filed, separate returns shall not be made by the spouses after the time for filing the return of either has expired. See, however, paragraph (d)(5) of this section for the right of an executor to file a late separate return for a deceased spouse and thereby disaffirm a timely joint return made by the surviving spouse.
(2) A joint return of a husband and wife (if not made by an agent of one or both spouses) shall be signed by both spouses. The provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.6012-1, relating to returns made by agents, shall apply where one spouse signs a return as agent for the other, or where a third party signs a return as agent for one or both spouses.
(b)
Nonresident alien.
A joint return shall not be made if either the husband or wife at any time during the taxable year is a nonresident alien, unless an election is in effect for the taxable year under section 6013 (g) or (h) and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Different taxable years.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, a husband and wife shall not file a joint return if they have different taxable years.
(d)
Joint return after death.
(1) Section 6013(a)(2) provides that a joint return may be made for the survivor and the deceased spouse or for both deceased spouses if the taxable years of such spouses begin on the same day and end on different days only because of the death of either or both. Thus, if a husband and wife make this return on a calendar year basis, and the wife dies on August 1, 1956, a joint return may be made with respect to the calendar year 1956 of the husband and the taxable year of the wife beginning on January 1, 1956, and ending with her death on August 1, 1956. Similarly, if husband and wife both make their returns on the basis of a fiscal year beginning on July 1 and the wife dies on October 1, 1956, a joint return may be made with respect to the fiscal year of the husband beginning on July 1, 1956, and ending on June 30, 1957, and with respect to the taxable year of the wife beginning on July 1, 1956, and ending with her death on October 1, 1956.
(2) The provision allowing a joint return to be made for the taxable year in which the death of either or both spouses occurs is subject to two limitations. The first limitation is that if the surviving spouse remarries before the close of his taxable year, he shall not make a joint return with the first spouse who died during the taxable year. In such a case, however, the surviving spouse may make a joint return with his new spouse provided the other requirements with respect to the filing of a joint return are met. The second limitation is that the surviving spouse shall not make a joint return with the
deceased spouse if the taxable year of either spouse is a fractional part of a year under section 443(a)(1) resulting from a change of accounting period. For example, if a husband and wife make their returns on the calendar year basis and the wife dies on March 1, 1956, and thereafter the husband receives permission to change his annual accounting period to a fiscal year beginning July 1, 1956, no joint return shall be made for the short taxable year ending June 30, 1956. Similarly, if a husband and wife who make their returns on a calendar year basis receive permission to change to a fiscal year beginning July 1, 1956, and the wife dies on June 1, 1956, no joint return shall be made for the short taxable year ending June 30, 1956.
(3) Section 6013(a)(3) provides for the method of making a joint return in the case of the death of one spouse or both spouses. The general rule is that, in the case of the death of one spouse, or of both spouses, the joint return with respect to the decedent may be made only by his executor or administrator, as defined in paragraph (c) of § 1.6013-4. An exception is made to this general rule whereby, in the case of the death of one spouse, the joint return may be made by the surviving spouse with respect to both him and the decedent if all the following conditions exist:
(i) No return has been made by the decedent for the taxable year in respect of which the joint return is made;
(ii) No executor or administrator has been appointed at or before the time of making such joint return; and
(iii) No executor or administrator is appointed before the last day prescribed by law for filing the return of the surviving spouse.
These conditions are to be applied with respect to the return for each of the taxable years of the decedent for which a joint return may be made if more than one such taxable year is involved. Thus, in the case of husband and wife on the calendar year basis, if the wife dies in February 1957, a joint return for the husband and wife for 1956 may be made if the conditions set forth in this subparagraph are satisfied with respect to such return. A joint return also may be made by the survivor for both himself and the deceased spouse for the calendar year 1957 if it is separately determined that the conditions set forth in this subparagraph are satisfied with respect to the return for such year. If, however, the deceased spouse should, prior to her death, make a return for 1956, the surviving spouse may not thereafter make a joint return for himself and the deceased spouse for 1956.
(4) If an executor or administrator is appointed at or before the time of making the joint return or before the last day prescribed by law for filing the return of the surviving spouse, the surviving spouse cannot make a joint return for himself and the deceased spouse whether or not a separate return for the deceased spouse is made by such executor or administrator. In such a case, any return made solely by the surviving spouse shall be treated as his separate return. The joint return, if one is to be made, must be made by both the surviving spouse and the executor or administrator. In determining whether an executor or administrator is appointed before the last day prescribed by law for filing the return of the surviving spouse, an extension of time for making the return is included.
(5) If the surviving spouse makes the joint return provided for in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph and thereafter an executor or administrator of the decedent is appointed, the executor or administrator may disaffirm such joint return. This disaffirmance, in order to be effective, must be made within one year after the last day prescribed by law for filing the return of the surviving spouse (including any extension of time for filing such return) and must be made in the form of a separate return for the taxable year of the decedent with respect to which the joint return was made. In the event of such proper disaffirmance the return made by the survivor shall constitute his separate return, that is, the joint return made by him shall be treated as his return and the tax thereon shall be computed by excluding all items properly includible in the return of the deceased spouse. The separate return made by the executor or administrator shall constitute the return of the deceased spouse for the taxable year.
(6) The time allowed the executor or administrator to disaffirm the joint return by the making of a separate return does not establish a new due date for the return of the deceased spouse. Accordingly, the provisions of sections 6651 and 6601, relating to delinquent returns and delinquency in payment of tax, are applicable to such return made by the executor in disaffirmance of the joint return.
(e)
Return of surviving spouse treated as joint return.
For provisions relating to the treatment of the return of a surviving spouse as a joint return for each of the next two taxable years following the year of the death of the spouse, see section 2 and § 1.2-2.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12108, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7274, 38 FR 11345, May 7, 1973; T.D. 7670, 45 FR 6929, Jan. 31, 1980]
§ 1.6013-2
Joint return after filing separate return.
(a)
In general.
(1) Where an individual has filed a separate return for a taxable year for which a joint return could have been made by him and his spouse under section 6013(a), and the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year has expired, such individual and his spouse may, under conditions hereinafter set forth, make a joint return for such taxable year. The joint return filed pursuant to section 6013(b) shall constitute the return of the husband and wife for such year, and all payments, credits, refunds, or other repayments, made or allowed with respect to the separate return of either spouse are to be taken into account in determining the extent to which the tax based on the joint return has been paid.
(2) If a joint return is made under section 6013(b), any election, other than the election to file a separate return, made by either spouse in his separate return for the taxable year with respect to the treatment of any income, deduction, or credit of such spouse shall not be changed in the making of the joint return where such election would have been irrevocable if the joint return had not been made. Thus, if one spouse has made an irrevocable election to adopt and use the last-in, first-out inventory method under section 472, this election may not be changed upon making the joint return under section 6013(b).
(3) A joint return made under section 6013(b) after the death of either spouse shall, with respect to the decedent, be made only by his executor or administrator. Thus, where no executor or administrator has been appointed, a joint return cannot be made under section 6013(b).
(4) A nonresidential alien treated as a resident under section 6013 (g) or (h) for any taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1975, and the alien's U.S. citizen or resident spouse may file a joint return for that taxable year, even though one or both of the spouses have previously filed separate returns for that taxable year. In this case, the rule in paragraph (a)(3) of this section does not apply.
(b)
Limitations with respect to making of election.
A joint return shall not be made under section 6013(b)(1) with respect to a taxable year:
(1) Beginning on or before July 30, 1996, unless there is paid in full at or before the time of the filing of the joint return the amount shown as tax upon such joint return; or
(2) After the expiration of three years from the last day prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year determined without regard to any extension of time granted to either spouse; or
(3) After there has been mailed to either spouse, with respect to such taxable year, a notice of deficiency under section 6212, if the spouse, as to such notice, files a petition with the Tax Court of the United States within the time prescribed in section 6213; or
(4) After either spouse has commenced a suit in any court for the recovery of any part of the tax for such taxable year; or
(5) After either spouse has entered into a closing agreement under section 7121 with respect to such taxable year, or after any civil or criminal case arising against either spouse with respect to such taxable year has been compromised under section 7122.
(c)
When return deemed filed; assessment and collection; credit or refund.
(1) For the purpose of section 6501, relating to the period of limitations upon assessment and collection, and section
6651, relating to delinquent returns, a joint return made under section 6013(b) shall be deemed to have been filed, giving due regard to any extension of time granted to either spouse, on the following date:
(i) Where both spouses filed separate returns, prior to making the joint return under section 6013(b), on the date the last separate return of either spouse was filed for the taxable year, but not earlier than the last date prescribed by law for the filing of the return of either spouse;
(ii) Where only one spouse was required and did file a return prior to the making of the joint return under section 6013(b), on the date of the filing of the separate return, but not earlier than the last day prescribed by law for the filing of such return; or
(iii) Where both spouses were required to file a return, but only one spouse did so file, on the date of the filing of the joint return under section 6013(b).
(2) For the purpose of section 6511, relating to refunds and credits, a joint return made under section 6013(b) shall be deemed to have been filed on the last date prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year, determined without regard to any extension of time granted to either spouse for filing the return or paying the tax.
(d)
Additional time for assessment.
In the case of a joint return made under section 6013(b), the period of limitations provided in sections 6501 and 6502 shall not be less than one year after the date of the actual filing of such joint return. The expiration of the one year is to be determined without regard to the rules provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, relating to the application of sections 6501 and 6651 with respect to a joint return made under section 6013(b).
(e)
Additions to the tax and penalties.
(1) Where the amount shown as the tax by the husband and wife on a joint return made under section 6013(b) exceeds the aggregate of the amounts shown as tax on the separate return of each spouse, and such excess is attributable to negligence, intentional disregard of rules and regulations, or fraud at the time of the making of such separate return, there shall be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner as if it were a deficiency an additional amount as provided by the following:
(i) If any part of such excess is attributable to negligence, or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, at the time of the making of such separate return, but without any intent to defraud, this additional amount shall be 5 percent of the total amount of the excess.
(ii) If any part of such excess is attributable to fraud with intent to evade tax at the time of the making of such separate return, this additional amount shall be 50 percent of the total amount of the excess. The latter addition is in lieu of the 50 percent addition to the tax provided in section 6653(b).
(2) For purposes of section 7206 (1) and (2) and section 7207 (relating to criminal penalties in the case of fraudulent returns), the term “return” includes a separate return filed by a spouse with respect to a taxable year for which a joint return is made under section 6013(b) after the filing of a separate return.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12108, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7670, 45 FR 6929, Jan. 31, 1980; T.D. 8725, 62 FR 39117, July 22, 1997]
§ 1.6013-3
Treatment of joint return after death of either spouse.
For purposes of section 21 (relating to change in rates during a taxable year), section 443 (relating to returns for a period of less than 12 months), and section 7851(a)(1)(A) (relating to the applicability of certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), where the husband and wife have different taxable years because of death of either spouse, the joint return shall be treated as if the taxable years of both ended on the date of the closing of the surviving spouse's taxable year. Thus, in cases where the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 otherwise would apply to the taxable year of the decedent spouse and the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 would apply to the taxable year of the surviving spouse, this provision makes the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applicable to the taxable years of both spouses if a joint return is filed.
§ 1.6013-4
Applicable rules.
(a)
Status as husband and wife.
For the purpose of filing a joint return under section 6013, the status as husband and wife of two individuals having taxable years beginning on the same day shall be determined:
(1) If the taxable year of each individual is the same, as of the close of such year; and
(2) If the close of the taxable year is different by reason of the death of one spouse, as of the time of such death.
An individual legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance shall not be considered as married. However, the mere fact that spouses have not lived together during the course of the taxable year shall not prohibit them from making a joint return. A husband and wife who are separated under an interlocutory decree of divorce retain the relationship of husband and wife until the decree becomes final. The fact that the taxpayer and his spouse are divorced or legally separated at any time after the close of the taxable year shall not deprive them of their right to file a joint return for such taxable year under section 6013.
(b)
Computation of income, deductions, and tax.
If a joint return is made, the gross income and adjusted gross income of husband and wife on the joint return are computed in an aggregate amount and the deductions allowed and the taxable income are likewise computed on an aggregate basis. Deductions limited to a percentage of the adjusted gross income, such as the deduction for charitable, etc., contributions and gifts, under section 170, will be allowed with reference to such aggregate adjusted gross income. A similar rule is applied in the case of the limitation of section 1211(b) on the allowance of losses resulting from the sale or exchange of capital assets (see § 1.1211-1). Although there are two taxpayers on a joint return, there is only one taxable income. The tax on the joint return shall be computed on the aggregate income and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several. For computation of tax in the case of a joint return, see § 1.2-1. For tax in the case of a joint return of husband and wife electing to pay the optional tax under section 3, see § 1.3-1. For the election not to show on a joint return the amount of tax due in connection therewith, see paragraph (c) of § 1.6014-1 and paragraph (d) of § 1.6014-2. For separate computations of the self-employment tax of each spouse on a joint return, see paragraph (b) of § 1.6017-1.
(c)
Definition of executor or administrator.
For purposes of section 6013 the term “executor or administrator” means the person who is actually appointed to such office and not a person who is merely in charge of the property of the decedent.
(d)
Return signed under duress.
If an individual asserts and establishes that he or she signed a return under duress, the return is not a joint return. The individual who signed such return under duress is not jointly and severally liable for the tax shown on the return or any deficiency in tax with respect to the return. The return is adjusted to reflect only the tax liability of the individual who voluntarily signed the return, and the liability is determined at the applicable rates in section 1(d) for married individuals filing separate returns. Section 6212 applies to the assessment of any deficiency in tax on such return.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12108, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7102, 36 FR 5497, Mar. 24, 1971; T.D. 9003, 67 FR 47285, July 18, 2002]
§ 1.6013-6
Election to treat nonresident alien individual as resident of the United States.
(a)
Election for special treatment
—(1)
In general.
Two individuals who are husband and wife at the close of a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1975, may make an election under this section for that taxable year if, at the close of that year, one spouse is a citizen or resident of the United States and the other spouse is a nonresident alien. The effect of the election is that each spouse is treated as a resident of the United States for purposes of chapters 1, 5, and 24 and sections 6012, 6013, 6072, and 6091 of the Code for the entire taxable year. An election made under this section is in effect for the taxable year for which made and for all subsequent years of the husband and wife, except:
(i) Any taxable year for which the election is suspended, as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and
(ii) Any taxable year for which the election is terminated in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and all subsequent taxable years.
A husband and wife may not make an election if an election previously made under this section by either spouse has been terminated under paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Particular rules.
(i) As used in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the term “U.S. spouse” means any married individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States at any time during a taxable year.
(ii) An individual's residence is determined by application of the principles of §§ 301.7701(b)-1 through 301.7701(b)-9 of this chapter relating to what constitutes residence in the United States by an alien individual.
(iii) Whether two individuals are married at the close of a taxable year is determined by application of the rules in § 1.6013-4(a).
(iv) The provisions of section 879 and the regulations thereunder shall not apply for any taxable year for which an election under this section is in effect.
(v) An individual who makes an election under this section may not, for United States income tax purposes, claim under any United States income tax treaty not to be a U.S. resident. The relationship of U.S. income tax treaties and the election under this section is illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
H, a U.S. citizen, is married to W, a nonresident alien of the United States and a domiciliary of country X. H and W maintain their only permanent home in country X. W receives both U.S. source and country X source interest during the taxable year. The interest is not effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base in any country. H and W make the section 6013 (g) election. Under article ii (1) of the United States—country X Income Tax Convention interest derived and beneficially owned by a resident of one contracting state is exempt from tax in the other contracting state. Article 4 (1) of the treaty provides that an individual is a resident of a contracting state if subject to tax in that country by reason of the individual's domicile, residence, or citizenship. Under article 4 (1) of the treaty, W is a resident of country X by virtue of her domicile in country X and also of the United States by virtue of the section 6013 (g) election. Article 4 (2) of the treaty provides that if an individual is a resident of both the United States and country X by reason of article 4 (1), the individual shall be deemed to be a resident of the contracting state in which he or she has a permanent home available. Because W's sole permanent home is in country X, under article 4 (2) of the treaty W is treated as a resident of country X for purposes of the treaty. Because W has elected under section 6013(g) to be treated as a U.S. resident (and thus to be taxed on worldwide income), W may not, for U.S. income tax purposes, claim under the treaty not to be a U.S. resident. W, therefore, is subject to U.S. income tax on the interest. For purposes of country X income tax, W is considered a resident of country X under the treaty.
(3)
Suspension of election.
(i) An election made under this section is suspended and is not in effect for a taxable year subsequent to the first taxable year for which made if neither spouse is a U.S. spouse during that subsequent taxable year. Thus, for example, the election is in suspense if both spouses are nonresident aliens for the entire taxable year.
(ii) If either spouse dies during any taxable year for which the election under this section is in effect, other than the first taxable year for which the election is to be in effect, the taxable year shall include, solely for purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), only those days during the taxable year on which both spouses are alive. Thus, for example, if the U.S. spouse dies during the taxable year, the election is not suspended for that year even if the surviving nonresident alien spouse never acquires U.S. citizenship or residency. Similarly, if the nonresident alien spouse dies during the taxable year, the election is not suspended for that year even if the surviving U.S. spouse subsequently abandons U.S. citizenship or residency. However, if neither spouse was a U.S. spouse at any time during the period of the taxable year when both spouses were alive, the election is suspended for that year even if the surviving spouse subsequently acquires U.S. citizenship or residency.
For the effect of the death of either spouse on the status of the election in subsequent taxable years, see paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4)
Time and manner of making an election.
(i) A husband and wife shall make the election under this section by attaching a statement to a joint return for the first taxable year for which the election is to be in effect. The election must be made before the expiration of the period prescribed by section 6511(a) (or section 6511(c) if the period is extended by agreement) for making a claim for credit or refund. If either or both spouses die after the close of the taxable year but before the joint return is filed, the election may be made by the executor, administrator, or other person charged with the property of the deceased spouse. If the election is made with a joint amended return, the amended return should be made on Form 1040 or 1040A, the word “Amended” should be written clearly on the front of the return, and an amended return also must be filed for each subsequent taxable year as to which a return previously has been filed by either spouse.
(ii) The statement must contain a declaration that the election is being made and that the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are met for the taxable year. The statement must also contain the name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of each spouse. If the election is being made on behalf of a deceased spouse, the statement must contain the name and address of the executor, administrator, or other person making the election on behalf of the decreased spouse. The statement must be signed by both persons making the election.
(b)
Termination of election
—(1)
Revocation.
(i) An election under this section shall terminate if either spouse revokes the election. An election that is revoked terminates as of the first taxable year for which the last day prescribed by section 6072(a) and 6081(a) for filing the return of tax has not yet occurred.
(ii) Revocation of the election is made by filing a statement of revocation in the following manner. If the spouse revoking the election is required to file a return under section 6012, the statement is filed by attaching it to the return for the first taxable year to which the revocation applies. If the spouse revoking the election is not required to file a return under section 6012, but files a claim for refund under section 6511, the statement is filed by attaching it to the claim for refund. If the spouse revoking the election is not required to file a return and does not file a claim for refund, the statement is filed by submitting it to the service center director with whom was filed the most recent joint return of the spouses. The revocation may, if the revoking spouse dies after the close of the first taxable year to which the revocation applies but before the return, claim for refund, or statement of revocation is filed, be made by the executor, administrator or other person charged with the property of the deceased spouse.
(iii) A revocation of the election is effective as of a particular taxable year if it is filed on or before the last day prescribed by section 6072(a) and 6081(a) for filing the return of tax for that taxable year. However, the revocation is not final until that last day.
(iv) The statement of revocation must contain a declaration that the election under this section is being revoked. The statement must also contain the name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of each spouse. If the revocation is being made on behalf of a deceased spouse, the statement must contain the name and address of the executor, administrator, or other person revoking the election on behalf of the deceased spouse. The statement must also include a list of the States, foreign countries, and possessions of the United States which have community property laws and in which:
(A) Each spouse is domiciled, or
(B) real property is located from which either of the spouses receives income.
The statement must be signed by the person revoking the election.
(2)
Death.
An election under this section shall terminate if either spouse dies. An election that terminates on account of death terminates as of the first taxable year of the surviving spouse following the taxable year in which the death occurred. However, if the surviving spouse is a citizen or resident of the United States who is entitled to the benefits of section 2, the
election terminates as of the first taxable year following the last taxable year for which the surviving spouse is entitled to the benefits of section 2. If both spouses die within the same taxable year, the election terminates as of the first day after the close of the taxable year in which the deaths occurred.
(3)
Legal separation.
An election under this section terminates if the spouses legally separate under a degree of divorce or of separate maintenance. An election that terminates on account of legal separation terminates as of the close of the taxable year preceding the taxable year in which the separation occurs. The rules in § 1.6013-4(a) are relevant in determining whether two spouses are legally separated.
(4)
Inadequate records.
An election under this section may be terminated by the Commissioner if it is determined that either spouse has failed to keep adequate records. An election that is terminated on account of inadequate records terminates as of the close of the taxable year preceding the taxable year for which the Commissioner determines that the election should be terminated. Adequate records are the books, records, and other information reasonably necessary to ascertain the amount of liability for taxes under chapters 1, 5, and 24 of the code of either spouse for the taxable year. Adequate records also includes the granting of access to the books and records.
(c)
Illustrations.
The application of this section is illustrated by the following examples. In each case the individual's taxable year is the calendar year and the spouses are not legally separated.

# Example 1.
W, a U.S. citizen for the entire taxable year 1979, is married to H, a nonresident alien individual. W and H may make the section 6013(g) election for 1979 by filing the statement of election with a joint return. If W and H make the election, income from sources within and without the United States received by W and H in 1979 and subsequent years must be included in gross income for each taxable year unless the election later is terminated or suspended. While W and H must file a joint return for 1979, joint or separate returns may be filed for subsequent years.

# Example 2.
H and W are husband and wife and are both nonresident alien individuals. In June 1980 H becomes a U.S. resident and remains a resident for the balance of the year. H and W may make the section 6013(g) election for 1980. If H and W make the election, income from sources within and without the United States received by H and W for the entire taxable year 1980 and subsequent years must be included in gross income for each taxable year, unless the election later is terminated or suspended.

# Example 3.
W, a U.S. resident on December 31, 1981, is married to H, a nonresident alien. W and H make the section 6013(g) election and file joint returns for 1981 and succeeding years. On January 10, 1987, W becomes a nonresident alien. H has remained a nonresident alien. W and H may file a joint return or separate returns for 1987. As neither W or H is a U.S. resident at any time during 1988, their election is suspended for 1988. If W and H have U.S. source or foreign source income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business in 1988, they must file separate returns as nonresident aliens. W becomes a U.S. resident again on January 5, 1990. Their election no longer is in suspense. Income from sources within and without the United States received by W or H in the years their election is not suspended must be included in gross income for each taxable year.

# Example 4.
H, a U.S. citizen for the entire taxable year 1979, is married to W, who is not a U.S. citizen. While W believes that she is a U.S. resident, H and W make the section 6013(g) election for 1979 to cover the possibility that later it would be determined that she is a nonresident alien during 1979. The election for 1979 will not be considered evidence that W was a nonresident alien in prior years. Income from sources within and without the United States received by H and W in 1979 and subsequent years must be included in gross income for each taxable year, unless the election later is terminated or suspended.

§ 1.6013-7
Joint return for year in which nonresident alien becomes resident of the United States.
(a)
Election for special treatment
—(1)
In general.
Two individuals who are husband and wife at the close of a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1975, may make an election under this section for that taxable year if one spouse is a citizen or resident of the United States on the last day of that taxable year and the other spouse is a nonresident alien at the beginning of that taxable year and a citizen or resident of the United States at the close
of that taxable year. Two married individuals who are nonresident aliens at the beginning of a taxable year and who are U.S. citizens or residents on the last day of that taxable year qualify for the election. The effect of the election is that each spouse is treated as a resident of the United States for purposes of chapters 1, 5, and 24 and sections 6012, 6013, 6072, and 6091 of the code for all of that taxable year. A husband and wife may not make an election if an election has previously been made under this section by either spouse.
(2)
Particular rules.
The rules in subdivisions (ii) through (v) of § 1.6013-6(a)(2) are applicable to this section.
(3)
Time and manner of making an election.
A husband and wife shall make the election under this section in accordance with the rules in § 1.6013-6(a)(4).
(b)
Section 6013(g) election in effect.
If an election under section 6013(g) is in effect for a year subsequent to the first taxable year for which made and during that subsequent year the husband and wife meet the requirements of section 6013(h) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, then the election under section 6013(g) shall apply to that subsequent taxable year. A separate election under section 6013(h) is not required for that subsequent taxable year.
[T.D. 7670, 45 FR 6931, Jan. 31, 1980]
§ 1.6014-1
Tax not computed by taxpayer for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970.
(a)
In general.
If an individual is entitled under paragraph (a)(7) of § 1.6012-1 to use as his return Form 1040A, he may elect not to show thereon the amount of the tax due in connection with such return if his gross income is less than $5,000.
(b)
Computation and payment of tax.
A taxpayer who, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, elects not to show the tax on Form 1040A is not required to pay the unpaid balance of such tax at the time he files the return. In such case, the tax will be computed for the taxpayer by the Internal Revenue Service, and a notice will be mailed to the taxpayer stating the amount of tax due. Where it is determined that a refund of tax is due, the Internal Revenue Service will send such refund to the taxpayer. See paragraph (c) of § 301.6402-3 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
(c)
Joint return.
(1) A husband and wife who, pursuant to paragraph (a)(7) of § 1.6012-1, file a joint return on Form 1040A may elect not to show the tax on such return if their aggregate gross income for the taxable year is less than $5,000.
(2) The tax computed for the taxpayer who files Form 1040A and elects not to show thereon the tax due shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
(i) A tax computed as though the return on Form 1040A constituted the separate returns of the spouses, or
(ii) A tax computed as though the return on Form 1040A constituted a joint return.
(d)
Married individuals filing separate returns.
In the case of a married individual who files a separate return and who elects under this section not to show his tax on Form 1040A his tax shall be computed with reference to the 10-percent standard deduction rather than the minimum standard deduction.
(e) This section shall apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12108, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6581, 26 FR 11678, Dec. 6, 1961; T.D. 6792, 30 FR 531, Jan. 15, 1965; T.D. 7102, 36 FR 5497, Mar. 24, 1971]
§ 1.6014-2
Tax not computed by taxpayer for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.
(a)
In general.
An individual subject to the tax imposed by section 1 of the Code may, in accordance with the instructions applicable to the income tax return to be filed, elect, for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, not to show on his income tax return for such year the amount of tax due in connection with such return.
(b)
Restriction on making an election.
The election pursuant to this section shall not be made by an individual who does not file his return (or amended return) making such election on or before the date prescribed in section 6072(a) for the filing of the original return (determined without regard to any extension of time).
(c)
Effects of election.
(1) A taxpayer who, in accordance with the provisions of this section, elects not to show the tax on his income tax return is not required to pay the unpaid balance of such tax at the time he files the return. In such case, the tax will be computed for the taxpayer by the Internal Revenue Service, and a notice will be mailed to the taxpayer stating the amount of tax due. Where it is determined that a refund of tax is due, the Internal Revenue Service will send such refund to the taxpayer. See paragraph (c) of § 301.6402-3 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration). The computation of tax by the Internal Revenue Service shall be treated for purposes of this chapter as if made by the taxpayer, and such computation or the issuance of a notice or refund pursuant thereto shall not relieve the taxpayer of liability for any deficiency (although the deficiency is based upon an amount of tax different from that computed for the taxpayer by the Internal Revenue Service) or affect the rights of the Internal Revenue Service with respect to any subsequent audit or other review of the taxpayer's return.
(2) Where the election provided for in this section is made by a taxpayer who takes the standard deduction and who has adjusted gross income of less than $10,000, such election constitutes an election to pay the tax imposed by section 3.
(3) A taxpayer who makes an election under section 6014 shall not be precluded from claiming:
(i) Status as a head of household or a surviving spouse;
(ii) The credit under section 31 (relating to tax withheld on wages);
(iii) The credit under section 37 (relating to retirement income);
(iv) The credit under section 38 (relating to investment in certain depreciable property);
(v) The credit under section 39 (relating to certain uses of gasoline and lubricating oil);
(vi) The credit under section 41 (relating to contributions to candidates for public office);
(vii) The credit under section 42 (relating to personal exemptions);
(viii) The credit under section 43 (relating to earned income);
(ix) The credit under section 44 (relating to purchase of new principal residence); or
(x) The credit under section 45 (relating to overpayments of tax).
(d)
Joint returns.
(1) A husband and wife who file a joint return may elect not to show the tax on such return in accordance with the rules prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(2) The tax computed for a husband and wife who elect pursuant to this section not to show their tax on their joint income tax return shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
(i) A tax computed as though the return of income constituted a joint return, or
(ii) If sufficient information is provided for the taxable income of each spouse to be determined, a tax computed as though the return of income constituted the separate returns of the spouses.
(e)
Married individuals filing separate returns.
This section shall apply to married individuals filing separate returns unless otherwise provided in the instructions accompanying a return. The instructions may require the taxpayer to attach to his return a statement to the effect that his tax and the tax of his spouse were determined in accordance with the rules of sections 141(d) and 142(a).
(f)
Revocation of election.
An election pursuant to this section may be revoked on an amended return (whether such return is filed before or after the date prescribed in section 6072(a) for filing the original return).

§ 1.6015-1
Relief from joint and several liability on a joint return.
(a)
In general.
(1) An individual who qualifies and elects under section 6013 to file a joint Federal income tax return with another individual is jointly and severally liable for the joint Federal income tax liabilities for that year. A spouse or former spouse may be relieved of joint and several liability for Federal income tax for that year under the following three relief provisions:
(i) Innocent spouse relief under § 1.6015-2.
(ii) Allocation of deficiency under § 1.6015-3.
(iii) Equitable relief under § 1.6015-4.
(2) A requesting spouse may submit a single claim electing relief under both or either §§ 1.6015-2 and 1.6015-3, and requesting relief under § 1.6015-4. However, equitable relief under § 1.6015-4 is available only to a requesting spouse who fails to qualify for relief under §§ 1.6015-2 and 1.6015-3. If a requesting spouse elects the application of either § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3, the Internal Revenue Service will consider whether relief is appropriate under the other elective provision and, to the extent relief is unavailable under either, under § 1.6015-4. If a requesting spouse seeks relief only under § 1.6015-4, the Secretary may not grant relief under § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3 in the absence of an affirmative election made by the requesting spouse under either of those sections. If in the course of reviewing a request for relief only under § 1.6015-4, the IRS determines that the requesting spouse may qualify for relief under § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3 instead of § 1.6015-4, the Internal Revenue Service will correspond with the requesting spouse to see if the requesting spouse would like to amend his or her request to elect the application of § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3. If the requesting spouse chooses to amend the claim for relief, the requesting spouse must submit an affirmative election under § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3. The amended claim for relief will relate back to the original claim for purposes of determining the timeliness of the claim.
(3) Relief is not available for liabilities that are required to be reported on a joint Federal income tax return but are not income taxes imposed under Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., domestic service employment taxes under section 3510).
(b)
Duress.
For rules relating to the treatment of returns signed under duress, see § 1.6013-4(d).
(c)
Prior closing agreement or offer in compromise
—(1)
In general.
A requesting spouse is not entitled to relief from joint and several liability under § 1.6015-2, 1.6015-3, or 1.6015-4 for any tax year for which the requesting spouse has entered into a closing agreement with the Commissioner that disposes of the same liability that is the subject of the claim for relief. In addition, a requesting spouse is not entitled to relief from joint and several liability under § 1.6015-2, 1.6015-3, or 1.6015-4 for any tax year for which the requesting spouse has entered into an offer in compromise with the Commissioner. For rules relating to the effect of closing agreements and offers in compromise, see sections 7121 and 7122, and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Exception for agreements relating to TEFRA partnership proceedings.
The rule in paragraph (c)(1) of this section regarding the unavailability of relief from joint and several liability when the liability to which the claim for relief relates was the subject of a prior closing agreement entered into by the requesting spouse, shall not apply to an agreement described in section 6224(c) with respect to partnership items (or any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to adjustments to partnership items) that is entered into while the requesting spouse is a party to a pending partnership-level proceeding conducted under the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code (TEFRA partnership proceeding). If, however, a requesting spouse enters into a closing agreement pertaining to any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to adjustments to partnership items, at a time when the requesting spouse is not a party to a pending TEFRA partnership proceeding (e.g., in connection with an affected items proceeding),
then the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) shall apply. Similarly, if a requesting spouse enters into a closing agreement with respect to both partnership items (including affected items) and nonpartnership items, while the requesting spouse is a party to a pending TEFRA partnership proceeding, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) shall apply to the portion of the closing agreement that relates to nonpartnership items and the provisions of this paragraph (c)(2) shall apply to the remainder of the closing agreement.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1.
H and W file joint returns for taxable years 2002-2004, on which they claim losses attributable to H's limited partnership interest in Partnership A. In January 2006, the Internal Revenue Service commences an audit under the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code (TEFRA partnership proceeding) regarding Partnership A's 2002-2004 taxable years, and sends H and W a notice under section 6223(a)(1). In September 2007, H files a bankruptcy petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and receives a discharge in April 2008. In August 2008, H and W enter into a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service, in which H and W agree to the disallowance of some of the claimed losses from Partnership A for taxable years 2002 through 2007. W may not later claim relief from joint and several liability under section 6015 as to the disallowed losses attributable to Partnership A for taxable years 2002 to 2007. This is because at the time W entered into the closing agreement, H's partnership items attributable to Partnership A had converted to nonpartnership items as a result of H's filing of the bankruptcy petition. The conversion of H's items also terminated W's status as a partner in the TEFRA partnership proceeding regarding Partnership A. Consequently, the closing agreement did not pertain to partnership items and W was not a party to a pending partnership-level proceeding regarding Partnership A when she entered into the closing agreement. Accordingly, the exception in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for agreements relating to TEFRA partnership proceedings does not apply.

# Example 2.
H and W file a joint return for taxable year 2002, on which they claim $25,000 in losses attributable to H's general partnership interest in Partnership B. In November 2003, the Service proposes a deficiency in tax relating to H's and W's 2002 joint return arising from omitted taxable interest income in the amount of $2,000 that is attributable to H. In July 2005, the Internal Revenue Service commences a TEFRA partnership proceeding regarding Partnership B's 2002 and 2003 taxable years, and sends H and W a notice under section 6223(a)(1). In March 2006, H and W enter into a closing agreement with the Service. The closing agreement provides for the disallowance of the claimed losses from Partnership B in excess of H's and W's out-of-pocket expenditures relating to Partnership B for taxable year 2002 and any subsequent year(s) in which H and W claimed losses from Partnership B. In addition, H and W agree to the imposition of the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 with respect to the disallowed losses attributable to partnership B. In the closing agreement, H and W also agree to the deficiency resulting from the omitted interest income for taxable year 2002. W may not later claim relief from joint and several liability under section 6015 as to the deficiency in tax attributable to the omitted income of $2,000 for taxable year 2002, because this portion of the closing agreement pertains to nonpartnership items. In contrast, W may claim relief from joint and several liability as to the disallowed losses and accuracy-related penalty attributable to Partnership B for taxable year 2002 or any subsequent year(s). This is because this portion of the closing agreement pertains to partnership and affected items and was entered into at a time when W was a party to the pending partnership-level proceeding regarding Partnership B. Consequently, W never had the opportunity to raise the innocent spouse defense in the course of that TEFRA partnership proceeding. (See § 1.6015-5(b)(5) relating to premature claims).
(d)
Fraudulent scheme.
If the Secretary establishes that a spouse transferred assets to the other spouse as part of a fraudulent scheme, relief is not available under section 6015, and section 6013(d)(3) applies to the return. For purposes of this section, a fraudulent scheme includes a scheme to defraud the Service or another third party, including, but not limited to, creditors, ex-spouses, and business partners.
(e)
Res judicata and collateral estoppel.
A requesting spouse is barred from relief from joint and several liability under section 6015 by res judicata for any tax year for which a court of competent jurisdiction has rendered a final decision on the requesting spouse's tax liability if relief under section 6015 was at issue in the prior proceeding, or if the requesting spouse meaningfully participated in that proceeding and
could have raised relief under section 6015. A requesting spouse has not meaningfully participated in a prior proceeding if, due to the effective date of section 6015, relief under section 6015 was not available in that proceeding. Also, any final decisions rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction regarding issues relevant to section 6015 are conclusive and the requesting spouse may be collaterally estopped from relitigating those issues.
(f)
Community property laws
—(1)
In general.
In determining whether relief is available under § 1.6015-2, 1.6015-3, or 1.6015-4, items of income, credits, and deductions are generally allocated to the spouses without regard to the operation of community property laws. An erroneous item is attributed to the individual whose activities gave rise to such item. See § 1.6015-3(d)(2).
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (f):

# Example.
(i) H and W are married and have lived in State A (a community property state) since 1987. On April 15, 2003, H and W file a joint Federal income tax return for the 2002 taxable year. In August 2005, the Internal Revenue Service proposes a $17,000 deficiency with respect to the 2002 joint return. A portion of the deficiency is attributable to $20,000 of H's unreported interest income from his individual bank account. The remainder of the deficiency is attributable to $30,000 of W's disallowed business expense deductions. Under the laws of State A, H and W each own
1/2
of all income earned and property acquired during the marriage.
(ii) In November 2005, H and W divorce and W timely elects to allocate the deficiency. Even though the laws of State A provide that
1/2
of the interest income is W's, for purposes of relief under this section, the $20,000 unreported interest income is allocable to H, and the $30,000 disallowed deduction is allocable to W. The community property laws of State A are not considered in allocating items for this purpose.
(g)
Scope of this section and §§ 1.6015-2 through 1.6015-9.
This section and §§ 1.6015-2 through 1.6015-9 do not apply to any portion of a liability for any taxable year for which a claim for credit or refund is barred by operation of law or rule of law.
(h)
Definitions
—(1)
Requesting spouse.
A requesting spouse is an individual who filed a joint return and elects relief from Federal income tax liability arising from that return under § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3, or requests relief from Federal income tax liability arising from that return under § 1.6015-4.
(2)
Nonrequesting spouse.
A nonrequesting spouse is the individual with whom the requesting spouse filed the joint return for the year for which relief from liability is sought.
(3)
Item.
An item is that which is required to be separately listed on an individual income tax return or any required attachments. Items include, but are not limited to, gross income, deductions, credits, and basis.
(4)
Erroneous item.
An erroneous item is any item resulting in an understatement or deficiency in tax to the extent that such item is omitted from, or improperly reported (including improperly characterized) on an individual income tax return. For example, unreported income from an investment asset resulting in an understatement or deficiency in tax is an erroneous item. Similarly, ordinary income that is improperly reported as capital gain resulting in an understatement or deficiency in tax is also an erroneous item. In addition, a deduction for an expense that is personal in nature that results in an understatement or deficiency in tax is an erroneous item of deduction. An erroneous item is also an improperly reported item that affects the liability on other returns (e.g., an improper net operating loss that is carried back to a prior year's return). Penalties and interest are not erroneous items. Rather, relief from penalties and interest will generally be determined based on the proportion of the total erroneous items from which the requesting spouse is relieved. If a penalty relates to a particular erroneous item, see § 1.6015-3(d)(4)(iv)(B).
(5)
Election or request.
A qualifying election under § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3, or request under § 1.6015-4, is the first timely claim for relief from joint and several liability for the tax year for which relief is sought. A qualifying election also includes a requesting spouse's second election to seek relief from joint and several liability for the same tax year under § 1.6015-3 when the additional qualifications of paragraphs (h)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section are met—
(i) The requesting spouse did not qualify for relief under § 1.6015-3 when the Internal Revenue Service considered the first election solely because the qualifications of § 1.6015-3(a) were not satisfied; and
(ii) At the time of the second election, the qualifications for relief under § 1.6015-3(a) are satisfied.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Transferee liability
—(1)
In general.
The relief provisions of section 6015 do not negate liability that arises under the operation of other laws. Therefore, a requesting spouse who is relieved of joint and several liability under § 1.6015-2, 1.6015-3, or 1.6015-4 may nevertheless remain liable for the unpaid tax (including additions to tax, penalties, and interest) to the extent provided by Federal or state transferee liability or property laws. For the rules regarding the liability of transferees, see sections 6901 through 6904 and the regulations thereunder. In addition, the requesting spouse's property may be subject to collection under Federal or state property laws.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (j):

# Example.
H and W timely file their 1998 joint income tax return on April 15, 1999. H dies in March 2000, and the executor of H's will transfers all of the estate's assets to W. In July 2001, the Internal Revenue Service assesses a deficiency for the 1998 return. The items giving rise to the deficiency are attributable to H. W is relieved of the liability under section 6015, and H's estate remains solely liable. The Internal Revenue Service may seek to collect the deficiency from W to the extent permitted under Federal or state transferee liability or property laws.
[T.D. 9003, 67 FR 47285, July 18, 2002]
§ 1.6015-2
Relief from liability applicable to all qualifying joint filers.
(a)
In general.
A requesting spouse may be relieved of joint and several liability for tax (including additions to tax, penalties, and interest) from an understatement for a taxable year under this section if the requesting spouse elects the application of this section in accordance with §§ 1.6015-1(h)(5) and 1.6015-5, and—
(1) A joint return was filed for the taxable year;
(2) On the return there is an understatement attributable to erroneous items of the nonrequesting spouse;
(3) The requesting spouse establishes that in signing the return he or she did not know and had no reason to know of the understatement; and
(4) It is inequitable to hold the requesting spouse liable for the deficiency attributable to the understatement.
(b)
Understatement.
The term
understatement
has the meaning given to such term by section 6662(d)(2)(A) and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Knowledge or reason to know.
A requesting spouse has knowledge or reason to know of an understatement if he or she actually knew of the understatement, or if a reasonable person in similar circumstances would have known of the understatement. For rules relating to a requesting spouse's actual knowledge, see § 1.6015-3(c)(2). All of the facts and circumstances are considered in determining whether a requesting spouse had reason to know of an understatement. The facts and circumstances that are considered include, but are not limited to, the nature of the erroneous item and the amount of the erroneous item relative to other items; the couple's financial situation; the requesting spouse's educational background and business experience; the extent of the requesting spouse's participation in the activity that resulted in the erroneous item; whether the requesting spouse failed to inquire, at or before the time the return was signed, about items on the return or omitted from the return that a reasonable person would question; and whether the erroneous item represented a departure from a recurring pattern reflected in prior years' returns (e.g., omitted income from an investment regularly reported on prior years' returns).
(d)
Inequity.
All of the facts and circumstances are considered in determining whether it is inequitable to hold a requesting spouse jointly and severally liable for an understatement. One relevant factor for this purpose is whether the requesting spouse significantly benefitted, directly or indirectly, from the understatement. A significant benefit is any benefit in excess
of normal support. Evidence of direct or indirect benefit may consist of transfers of property or rights to property, including transfers that may be received several years after the year of the understatement. Thus, for example, if a requesting spouse receives property (including life insurance proceeds) from the nonrequesting spouse that is beyond normal support and traceable to items omitted from gross income that are attributable to the nonrequesting spouse, the requesting spouse will be considered to have received significant benefit from those items. Other factors that may also be taken into account, if the situation warrants, include the fact that the requesting spouse has been deserted by the nonrequesting spouse, the fact that the spouses have been divorced or separated, or that the requesting spouse received benefit on the return from the understatement. For guidance concerning the criteria to be used in determining whether it is inequitable to hold a requesting spouse jointly and severally liable under this section, see Rev. Proc. 2000-15 (2000-1 C.B. 447), or other guidance published by the Treasury and IRS (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(e)
Partial relief
—(1)
In general.
If a requesting spouse had no knowledge or reason to know of only a portion of an erroneous item, the requesting spouse may be relieved of the liability attributable to that portion of that item, if all other requirements are met with respect to that portion.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (e):

# Example.
H and W are married and file their 2004 joint income tax return in March 2005. In April 2006, H is convicted of embezzling $2 million from his employer during 2004. H kept all of his embezzlement income in an individual bank account, and he used most of the funds to support his gambling habit. H and W had a joint bank account into which H and W deposited all of their reported income. Each month during 2004, H transferred an additional $10,000 from the individual account to H and W's joint bank account. W paid the household expenses using this joint account, and regularly received the bank statements relating to the account. W had no knowledge or reason to know of H's embezzling activities. However, W did have knowledge and reason to know of $120,000 of the $2 million of H's embezzlement income at the time she signed the joint return because that amount passed through the couple's joint bank account. Therefore, W may be relieved of the liability arising from $1,880,000 of the unreported embezzlement income, but she may not be relieved of the liability for the deficiency arising from $120,000 of the unreported embezzlement income of which she knew and had reason to know.
[T.D. 9003, 67 FR 47285, July 18, 2002]
§ 1.6015-3
Allocation of deficiency for individuals who are no longer married, are legally separated, or are not members of the same household.
(a)
Election to allocate deficiency.
A requesting spouse may elect to allocate a deficiency if, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, the requesting spouse is divorced, widowed, or legally separated, or has not been a member of the same household as the nonrequesting spouse at any time during the 12-month period ending on the date an election for relief is filed. For purposes of this section, the marital status of a deceased requesting spouse will be determined on the earlier of the date of the election or the date of death in accordance with section 7703(a)(1). Subject to the restrictions of paragraph (c) of this section, an eligible requesting spouse who elects the application of this section in accordance with §§ 1.6015-1(h)(5) and 1.6015-5 generally may be relieved of joint and several liability for the portion of any deficiency that is allocated to the nonrequesting spouse pursuant to the allocation methods set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. Relief may be available to both spouses filing the joint return if each spouse is eligible for and elects the application of this section.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Divorced.
A determination of whether a requesting spouse is divorced for purposes of this section will be made in accordance with section 7703 and the regulations thereunder. Such determination will be made as of the date the election is filed.
(2)
Legally separated.
A determination of whether a requesting spouse is legally separated for purposes of this section will be made in accordance with section 7703 and the regulations thereunder. Such determination will be
made as of the date the election is filed.
(3)
Members of the same household
—(i)
Temporary absences.
A requesting spouse and a nonrequesting spouse are considered members of the same household during either spouse's temporary absences from the household if it is reasonable to assume that the absent spouse will return to the household, and the household or a substantially equivalent household is maintained in anticipation of such return. Examples of temporary absences may include, but are not limited to, absence due to incarceration, illness, business, vacation, military service, or education.
(ii)
Separate dwellings.
A husband and wife who reside in the same dwelling are considered members of the same household. In addition, a husband and wife who reside in two separate dwellings are considered members of the same household if the spouses are not estranged or one spouse is temporarily absent from the other's household within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(c)
Limitations
—(1)
No refunds.
Relief under this section is only available for unpaid liabilities resulting from understatements of liability. Refunds are not authorized under this section.
(2)
Actual knowledge
—(i)
In general.
If, under section 6015(c)(3)(C), the Secretary demonstrates that, at the time the return was signed, the requesting spouse had actual knowledge of an erroneous item that is allocable to the nonrequesting spouse, the election to allocate the deficiency attributable to that item is invalid, and the requesting spouse remains liable for the portion of the deficiency attributable to that item. The Service, having both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion, must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the requesting spouse had actual knowledge of the erroneous item in order to invalidate the election.
(A)
Omitted income.
In the case of omitted income, knowledge of the item includes knowledge of the receipt of the income. For example, assume W received $5,000 of dividend income from her investment in X Co. but did not report it on the joint return. H knew that W received $5,000 of dividend income from X Co. that year. H had actual knowledge of the erroneous item (i.e., $5,000 of unreported dividend income from X Co.), and no relief is available under this section for the deficiency attributable to the dividend income from X Co. This rule applies equally in situations where the other spouse has unreported income although the spouse does not have an actual receipt of cash (e.g., dividend reinvestment or a distributive share from a flow-through entity shown on Schedule K-1, “Partner's Share of Income, Credits, Deductions, etc.”).
(B)
Deduction or credit
—(
1
)
Erroneous deductions in general.
In the case of an erroneous deduction or credit, knowledge of the item means knowledge of the facts that made the item not allowable as a deduction or credit.
(
2
)
Fictitious or inflated deduction.
If a deduction is fictitious or inflated, the IRS must establish that the requesting spouse actually knew that the expenditure was not incurred, or not incurred to that extent.
(ii)
Partial knowledge.
If a requesting spouse had actual knowledge of only a portion of an erroneous item, then relief is not available for that portion of the erroneous item. For example, if H knew that W received $1,000 of dividend income and did not know that W received an additional $4,000 of dividend income, relief would not be available for the portion of the deficiency attributable to the $1,000 of dividend income of which H had actual knowledge. A requesting spouse's actual knowledge of the proper tax treatment of an item is not relevant for purposes of demonstrating that the requesting spouse had actual knowledge of an erroneous item. For example, assume H did not know W's dividend income from X Co. was taxable, but knew that W received the dividend income. Relief is not available under this section. In addition, a requesting spouse's knowledge of how an erroneous item was treated on the tax return is not relevant to a determination of whether the requesting spouse had actual knowledge of the item. For example, assume that H knew of W's dividend income, but H failed to review the completed return and did not know that W omitted the
dividend income from the return. Relief is not available under this section.
(iii)
Knowledge of the source not sufficient.
Knowledge of the source of an erroneous item is not sufficient to establish actual knowledge. For example, assume H knew that W owned X Co. stock, but H did not know that X Co. paid dividends to W that year. H's knowledge of W's ownership in X Co. is not sufficient to establish that H had actual knowledge of the dividend income from X Co. In addition, a requesting spouse's actual knowledge may not be inferred when the requesting spouse merely had reason to know of the erroneous item. Even if H's knowledge of W's ownership interest in X Co. indicates a reason to know of the dividend income, actual knowledge of such dividend income cannot be inferred from H's reason to know. Similarly, the IRS need not establish that a requesting spouse knew of the source of an erroneous item in order to establish that the requesting spouse had actual knowledge of the item itself. For example, assume H knew that W received $1,000, but he did not know the source of the $1,000. W and H omit the $1,000 from their joint return. H has actual knowledge of the item giving rise to the deficiency ($1,000), and relief is not available under this section.
(iv)
Factors supporting actual knowledge.
To demonstrate that a requesting spouse had actual knowledge of an erroneous item at the time the return was signed, the IRS may rely upon all of the facts and circumstances. One factor that may be relied upon in demonstrating that a requesting spouse had actual knowledge of an erroneous item is whether the requesting spouse made a deliberate effort to avoid learning about the item in order to be shielded from liability. This factor, together with all other facts and circumstances, may demonstrate that the requesting spouse had actual knowledge of the item, and the requesting spouse's election would be invalid with respect to that entire item. Another factor that may be relied upon in demonstrating that a requesting spouse had actual knowledge of an erroneous item is whether the requesting spouse and the nonrequesting spouse jointly owned the property that resulted in the erroneous item. Joint ownership is a factor supporting a finding that the requesting spouse had actual knowledge of an erroneous item. For purposes of this paragraph, a requesting spouse will not be considered to have had an ownership interest in an item based solely on the operation of community property law. Rather, a requesting spouse who resided in a community property state at the time the return was signed will be considered to have had an ownership interest in an item only if the requesting spouse's name appeared on the ownership documents, or there otherwise is an indication that the requesting spouse asserted dominion and control over the item. For example, assume H and W live in State A, a community property state. After their marriage, H opens a bank account in his name. Under the operation of the community property laws of State A, W owns
1/2
of the bank account. However, W does not have an ownership interest in the account for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv) because the account is not held in her name and there is no other indication that she asserted dominion and control over the item.
(v)
Abuse exception.
If the requesting spouse establishes that he or she was the victim of domestic abuse prior to the time the return was signed, and that, as a result of the prior abuse, the requesting spouse did not challenge the treatment of any items on the return for fear of the nonrequesting spouse's retaliation, the limitation on actual knowledge in this paragraph (c) will not apply. However, if the requesting spouse involuntarily executed the return, the requesting spouse may choose to establish that the return was signed under duress. In such a case, § 1.6013-4(d) applies.
(3)
Disqualified asset transfers
—(i)
In general.
The portion of the deficiency for which a requesting spouse is liable is increased (up to the entire amount of the deficiency) by the value of any disqualified asset that was transferred to the requesting spouse. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), the value of a disqualified asset is the fair market value of the asset on the date of the transfer.
(ii)
Disqualified asset defined.
A disqualified asset is any property or right to property that was transferred from
the nonrequesting spouse to the requesting spouse if the principal purpose of the transfer was the avoidance of tax or payment of tax (including additions to tax, penalties, and interest).
(iii)
Presumption.
Any asset transferred from the nonrequesting spouse to the requesting spouse during the 12-month period before the mailing date of the first letter of proposed deficiency (e.g., a 30-day letter or, if no 30-day letter is mailed, a notice of deficiency) is presumed to be a disqualified asset. The presumption also applies to any asset that is transferred from the nonrequesting spouse to the requesting spouse after the mailing date of the first letter of proposed deficiency. The presumption does not apply, however, if the requesting spouse establishes that the asset was transferred pursuant to a decree of divorce or separate maintenance or a written instrument incident to such a decree. If the presumption does not apply, but the Internal Revenue Service can establish that the purpose of the transfer was the avoidance of tax or payment of tax, the asset will be disqualified, and its value will be added to the amount of the deficiency for which the requesting spouse remains liable. If the presumption applies, a requesting spouse may still rebut the presumption by establishing that the principal purpose of the transfer was not the avoidance of tax or payment of tax.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules in this paragraph (c):

# Example 1. Actual knowledge of an erroneous item.
(i) H and W file their 2001 joint Federal income tax return on April 15, 2002. On the return, H and W report W's self-employment income, but they do not report W's self-employment tax on that income. H and W divorce in July 2003. In August 2003, H and W receive a 30-day letter from the Internal Revenue Service proposing a deficiency with respect to W's unreported self-employment tax on the 2001 return. On November 4, 2003, H files an election to allocate the deficiency to W. The erroneous item is the self-employment income, and it is allocable to W. H knows that W earned income in 2001 as a self-employed musician, but he does not know that self-employment tax must be reported on and paid with a joint return.
(ii) H's election to allocate the deficiency to W is invalid because, at the time H signed the joint return, H had actual knowledge of W's self-employment income. The fact that H was unaware of the tax consequences of that income (i.e., that an individual is required to pay self-employment tax on that income) is not relevant.

# Example 2. Actual knowledge not inferred from a requesting spouse's reason to know.
(i) H has long been an avid gambler. H supports his gambling habit and keeps all of his gambling winnings in an individual bank account, held solely in his name. W knows about H's gambling habit and that he keeps a separate bank account, but she does not know whether he has any winnings because H does not tell her, and she does not otherwise know of H's bank account transactions. H and W file their 2001 joint Federal income tax return on April 15, 2002. On October 31, 2003, H and W receive a 30-day letter proposing a $100,000 deficiency relating to H's unreported gambling income. In February 2003, H and W divorce, and in March 2004, W files an election under section 6015(c) to allocate the $100,000 deficiency to H.
(ii) While W may have had reason to know of the gambling income because she knew of H's gambling habit and separate account, W did not have actual knowledge of the erroneous item (i.e., the gambling winnings). The Internal Revenue Service may not infer actual knowledge from W's reason to know of the income. Therefore, W's election to allocate the $100,000 deficiency to H is valid.

# Example 3. Actual knowledge and failure to review return.
(i) H and W are legally separated. In February 1999, W signs a blank joint Federal income tax return for 1998 and gives it to H to fill out. The return was timely filed on April 15, 1999. In September 2001, H and W receive a 30-day letter proposing a deficiency relating to $100,000 of unreported dividend income received by H with respect to stock of ABC Co. owned by H. W knew that H received the $100,000 dividend payment in August 1998, but she did not know whether H reported that payment on the joint return.
(ii) On January 30, 2002, W files an election to allocate the deficiency from the 1998 return to H. W claims she did not review the completed joint return, and therefore, she had no actual knowledge that there was an understatement of the dividend income. W's election to allocate the deficiency to H is invalid because she had actual knowledge of the erroneous item (dividend income from ABC Co.) at the time she signed the return. The fact that W signed a blank return is irrelevant. The result would be the same if W had not reviewed the completed return or if W had reviewed the completed return and had not noticed that the item was omitted.

# Example 4. Actual knowledge of an erroneous item of income.
(i) H and W are legally separated. In June 2004, a deficiency is proposed with respect to H's and W's 2002 joint Federal income tax return that is attributable to
$30,000 of unreported income from H's plumbing business that should have been reported on a Schedule C. No Schedule C was attached to the return. At the time W signed the return, W knew that H had a plumbing business but did not know whether H received any income from the business. W's election to allocate to H the deficiency attributable to the $30,000 of unreported plumbing income is valid.
(ii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 5
except that, at the time W signed the return, W knew that H received $20,000 of plumbing income. W's election to allocate to H the deficiency attributable to the $20,000 of unreported plumbing income (of which W had actual knowledge) is invalid. W's election to allocate to H the deficiency attributable to the $10,000 of unreported plumbing income (of which W did not have actual knowledge) is valid.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 5
except that, at the time W signed the return, W did not know the exact amount of H's plumbing income. W did know, however, that H received at least $8,000 of plumbing income. W's election to allocate to H the deficiency attributable to $8,000 of unreported plumbing income (of which W had actual knowledge) is invalid. W's election to allocate to H the deficiency attributable to the remaining $22,000 of unreported plumbing income (of which W did not have actual knowledge) is valid.
(iv) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 5
except that H reported $26,000 of plumbing income on the return and omitted $4,000 of plumbing income from the return. At the time W signed the return, W knew that H was a plumber, but she did not know that H earned more than $26,000 that year. W's election to allocate to H the deficiency attributable to the $4,000 of unreported plumbing income is valid because she did not have actual knowledge that H received plumbing income in excess of $26,000.
(v) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 5
except that H reported only $20,000 of plumbing income on the return and omitted $10,000 of plumbing income from the return. At the time W signed the return, W knew that H earned at least $26,000 that year as a plumber. However, W did not know that, in reality, H earned $30,000 that year as a plumber. W's election to allocate to H the deficiency attributable to the $6,000 of unreported plumbing income (of which W had actual knowledge) is invalid. W's election to allocate to H the deficiency attributable to the $4,000 of unreported plumbing income (of which W did not have actual knowledge) is valid.

# Example 5. Actual knowledge of a deduction that is an erroneous item.
(i) H and W are legally separated. In February 2005, a deficiency is asserted with respect to their 2002 joint Federal income tax return. The deficiency is attributable to a disallowed $1,000 deduction for medical expenses H claimed he incurred. At the time W signed the return, W knew that H had not incurred any medical expenses. W's election to allocate to H the deficiency attributable to the disallowed medical expense deduction is invalid because W had actual knowledge that H had not incurred any medical expenses.
(ii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 6
except that, at the time W signed the return, W did not know whether H had incurred any medical expenses. W's election to allocate to H the deficiency attributable to the disallowed medical expense deduction is valid because she did not have actual knowledge that H had not incurred any medical expenses.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 6
except that the Internal Revenue Service disallowed $400 of the $1,000 medical expense deduction. At the time W signed the return, W knew that H had incurred some medical expenses but did not know the exact amount. W's election to allocate to H the deficiency attributable to the disallowed medical expense deduction is valid because she did not have actual knowledge that H had not incurred medical expenses (in excess of the floor amount under section 213(a)) of more than $600.
(iv) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 6
except that H claims a medical expense deduction of $10,000 and the Internal Revenue Service disallows $9,600. At the time W signed the return, W knew H had incurred some medical expenses but did not know the exact amount. W also knew that H incurred medical expenses (in excess of the floor amount under section 213(a)) of no more than $1,000. W's election to allocate to H the deficiency attributable to the portion of the overstated deduction of which she had actual knowledge ($9,000) is invalid. W's election to allocate the deficiency attributable to the portion of the overstated deduction of which she had no knowledge ($600) is valid.

# Example 6. Disqualified asset presumption.
(i) H and W are divorced. In May 1999, W transfers $20,000 to H, and in April 2000, H and W receive a 30-day letter proposing a $40,000 deficiency on their 1998 joint Federal income tax return. The liability remains unpaid, and in October 2000, H elects to allocate the deficiency under this section. Seventy-five percent of the net amount of erroneous items are allocable to W, and 25% of the net amount of erroneous items are allocable to H.
(ii) In accordance with the proportionate allocation method (see paragraph (d)(4) of this section), H proposes that $30,000 of the deficiency be allocated to W and $10,000 be allocated to himself. H submits a signed statement providing that the principal purpose of the $20,000 transfer was not the avoidance of tax or payment of tax, but he does
not submit any documentation indicating the reason for the transfer. H has not overcome the presumption that the $20,000 was a disqualified asset. Therefore, the portion of the deficiency for which H is liable ($10,000) is increased by the value of the disqualified asset ($20,000). H is relieved of liability for $10,000 of the $30,000 deficiency allocated to W, and remains jointly and severally liable for the remaining $30,000 of the deficiency (assuming that H does not qualify for relief under any other provision).

# Example 7. Disqualified asset presumption inapplicable.
On May 1, 2001, H and W receive a 30-day letter regarding a proposed deficiency on their 1999 joint Federal income tax return relating to unreported capital gain from H's sale of his investment in Z stock. W had no actual knowledge of the stock sale. The deficiency is assessed in November 2001, and in December 2001, H and W divorce. According to a decree of divorce, H must transfer
1/2
of his interest in mutual fund A to W. The transfer takes place in February 2002. In August 2002, W elects to allocate the deficiency to H. Although the transfer of
1/2
of H's interest in mutual fund A took place after the 30-day letter was mailed, the mutual fund interest is not presumed to be a disqualified asset because the transfer of H's interest in the fund was made pursuant to a decree of divorce.

# Example 8. Overcoming the disqualified asset presumption.
(i) H and W are married for 25 years. Every September, on W's birthday, H gives W a gift of $500. On February 28, 2002, H and W receive a 30-day letter from the Internal Revenue Service relating to their 1998 joint individual Federal income tax return. The deficiency relates to H's Schedule C business, and W had no knowledge of the items giving rise to the deficiency. H and W are legally separated in June 2003, and, despite the separation, H continues to give W $500 each year for her birthday. H is not required to give such amounts pursuant to a decree of divorce or separate maintenance.
(ii) On January 27, 2004, W files an election to allocate the deficiency to H. The $1,500 transferred from H to W from February 28, 2001 (a year before the 30-day letter was mailed) to the present is presumed disqualified. However, W may overcome the presumption that such amounts were disqualified by establishing that such amounts were birthday gifts from H and that she has received such gifts during their entire marriage. Such facts would show that the amounts were not transferred for the purpose of avoidance of tax or payment of tax.
(d)
Allocation
—(1)
In general.
(i) An election to allocate a deficiency limits the requesting spouse's liability to that portion of the deficiency allocated to the requesting spouse pursuant to this section.
(ii) Only a requesting spouse may receive relief. A nonrequesting spouse who does not also elect relief under this section remains liable for the entire amount of the deficiency. Even if both spouses elect to allocate a deficiency under this section, there may be a portion of the deficiency that is not allocable, for which both spouses remain jointly and severally liable.
(2)
Allocation of erroneous items.
For purposes of allocating a deficiency under this section, erroneous items are generally allocated to the spouses as if separate returns were filed, subject to the following four exceptions:
(i)
Benefit on the return.
An erroneous item that would otherwise be allocated to the nonrequesting spouse is allocated to the requesting spouse to the extent that the requesting spouse received a tax benefit on the joint return.
(ii)
Fraud.
The Internal Revenue Service may allocate any item between the spouses if the Internal Revenue Service establishes that the allocation is appropriate due to fraud by one or both spouses.
(iii)
Erroneous items of income.
Erroneous items of income are allocated to the spouse who was the source of the income. Wage income is allocated to the spouse who performed the services producing such wages. Items of business or investment income are allocated to the spouse who owned the business or investment. If both spouses owned an interest in the business or investment, the erroneous item of income is generally allocated between the spouses in proportion to each spouse's ownership interest in the business or investment, subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this section. In the absence of clear and convincing evidence supporting a different allocation, an erroneous income item relating to an asset that the spouses owned jointly is generally allocated 50% to each spouse, subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this section and the exceptions in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section. For rules regarding the effect of community property laws, see § 1.6015-1(f) and paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
(iv)
Erroneous deduction items.
Erroneous deductions related to a business or investment are allocated to the spouse who owned the business or investment. If both spouses owned an interest in the business or investment, an erroneous deduction item is generally allocated between the spouses in proportion to each spouse's ownership interest in the business or investment. In the absence of clear and convincing evidence supporting a different allocation, an erroneous deduction item relating to an asset that the spouses owned jointly is generally allocated 50% to each spouse, subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this section and the exceptions in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Deduction items unrelated to a business or investment are also generally allocated 50% to each spouse, unless the evidence shows that a different allocation is appropriate.
(3)
Burden of proof.
Except for establishing actual knowledge under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the requesting spouse must prove that all of the qualifications for making an election under this section are satisfied and that none of the limitations (including the limitation relating to transfers of disqualified assets) apply. The requesting spouse must also establish the proper allocation of the erroneous items.
(4)
General allocation method
—(i)
Proportionate allocation.
(A) The portion of a deficiency allocable to a spouse is the amount that bears the same ratio to the deficiency as the net amount of erroneous items allocable to the spouse bears to the net amount of all erroneous items. This calculation may be expressed as follows:
ER18JY02.004
where X = the portion of the deficiency allocable to the spouse.
(B) The proportionate allocation applies to any portion of the deficiency other than—
(
1
) Any portion of the deficiency attributable to erroneous items allocable to the nonrequesting spouse of which the requesting spouse had actual knowledge;
(
2
) Any portion of the deficiency attributable to separate treatment items (as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section);
(
3
) Any portion of the deficiency relating to the liability of a child (as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section) of the requesting spouse or nonrequesting spouse;
(
4
) Any portion of the deficiency attributable to alternative minimum tax under section 55;
(
5
) Any portion of the deficiency attributable to accuracy-related or fraud penalties;
(
6
) Any portion of the deficiency allocated pursuant to alternative allocation methods authorized under paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
(ii)
Separate treatment items.
Any portion of a deficiency that is attributable to an item allocable solely to one spouse and that results from the disallowance of a credit, or a tax or an addition to tax (other than tax imposed by section 1 or section 55) that is required to be included with a joint return (a separate treatment item) is allocated separately to that spouse. If such credit or tax is attributable in whole or in part to both spouses, then the IRS will determine on a case by case basis how such item will be allocated. Once the proportionate allocation is made, the liability for the requesting spouse's separate treatment items is added to the requesting spouse's share of the liability.
(iii)
Child's liability.
Any portion of a deficiency relating to the liability of a child of the requesting and nonrequesting spouse is allocated jointly to both spouses. For purposes of this paragraph, a child does not include the
taxpayer's stepson or stepdaughter, unless such child was legally adopted by the taxpayer. If the child is the child of only one of the spouses, and the other spouse had not legally adopted such child, any portion of a deficiency relating to the liability of such child is allocated solely to the parent spouse.
(iv)
Allocation of certain items
—(A)
Alternative minimum tax.
Any portion of a deficiency relating to the alternative minimum tax under section 55 will be allocated appropriately.
(B)
Accuracy-related and fraud penalties.
Any accuracy-related or fraud penalties under section 6662 or 6663 are allocated to the spouse whose item generated the penalty.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d). In each example, assume that the requesting spouse or spouses qualify to elect to allocate the deficiency, that any election is timely made, and that the deficiency remains unpaid. In addition, unless otherwise stated, assume that neither spouse has actual knowledge of the erroneous items allocable to the other spouse. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. Allocation of erroneous items.
(i) H and W file a 2003 joint Federal income tax return on April 15, 2004. On April 28, 2006, a deficiency is assessed with respect to their 2003 return. Three erroneous items give rise to the deficiency—
(A) Unreported interest income, of which W had actual knowledge, from H's and W's joint bank account;
(B) A disallowed business expense deduction on H's Schedule C; and
(C) A disallowed Lifetime Learning Credit for W's post-secondary education, paid for by W.
(ii) H and W divorce in May 2006, and in September 2006, W timely elects to allocate the deficiency. The erroneous items are allocable as follows:
(A) The interest income would be allocated
1/2
to H and
1/2
to W, except that W has actual knowledge of it. Therefore, W's election to allocate the portion of the deficiency attributable to this item is invalid, and W remains jointly and severally liable for it.
(B) The business expense deduction is allocable to H.
(C) The Lifetime Learning Credit is allocable to W.

# Example 2. Proportionate allocation.
(i) W and H timely file their 2001 joint Federal income tax return on April 15, 2002. On August 16, 2004, a $54,000 deficiency is assessed with respect to their 2001 joint return. H and W divorce on October 14, 2004, and W timely elects to allocate the deficiency. Five erroneous items give rise to the deficiency—
(A) A disallowed $15,000 business deduction allocable to H;
(B) $20,000 of unreported income allocable to H;
(C) A disallowed $5,000 deduction for educational expense allocable to H;
(D) A disallowed $40,000 charitable contribution deduction allocable to W; and
(E) A disallowed $40,000 interest deduction allocable to W.
(ii) In total, there are $120,000 worth of erroneous items, of which $80,000 are attributable to W and $40,000 are attributable to H.
W's items
H's items
$40,000

business deduction
40,000
interest deduction
20,000
unreported income
5,000
education deduction
$80,000
$40,000
(iii) The ratio of erroneous items allocable to W to the total erroneous items is
2/3
($80,000/$120,000). W's liability is limited to $36,000 of the deficiency (
2/3
of $54,000). The Internal Revenue Service may collect up to $36,000 from W and up to $54,000 from H (the total amount collected, however, may not exceed $54,000). If H also made an election, there would be no remaining joint and several liability, and the Internal Revenue Service would be permitted to collect $36,000 from W and $18,000 from H.

# Example 3. Proportionate allocation with joint erroneous item.
(i) On September 4, 2001, W elects to allocate a $3,000 deficiency for the 1998 tax year to H. Three erroneous items give rise to the deficiency—
(A) Unreported interest in the amount of $4,000 from a joint bank account;
(B) A disallowed deduction for business expenses in the amount of $2,000 attributable to H's business; and
(C) Unreported wage income in the amount of $6,000 attributable to W's second job.
(ii) The erroneous items total $12,000. Generally, income, deductions, or credits from jointly held property that are erroneous
items are allocable 50% to each spouse. However, in this case, both spouses had actual knowledge of the unreported interest income. Therefore, W's election to allocate the portion of the deficiency attributable to this item is invalid, and W and H remain jointly and severally liable for this portion. Assume that this portion is $1,000. W may allocate the remaining $2,000 of the deficiency.
H's items
W's items
$2,000
business deduction
$6,000
wage income
Total allocable items: $8,000
(iii) The ratio of erroneous items allocable to W to the total erroneous items is
3/4
($6,000/$8,000). W's liability is limited to $1,500 of the deficiency (
3/4
of $2,000) allocated to her. The Internal Revenue Service may collect up to $2,500 from W (
3/4
of the total allocated deficiency plus $1,000 of the deficiency attributable to the joint bank account interest) and up to $3,000 from H (the total amount collected, however, cannot exceed $3,000).
(iv) Assume H also elects to allocate the 1998 deficiency. H is relieved of liability for
3/4
of the deficiency, which is allocated to W. H's relief totals $1,500 (
3/4
of $2,000). H remains liable for $1,500 of the deficiency (
1/4
of the allocated deficiency plus $1,000 of the deficiency attributable to the joint bank account interest).

# Example 4. Separate treatment items (STIs).
(i) On September 1, 2006, a $28,000 deficiency is assessed with respect to H's and W's 2003 joint return. The deficiency is the result of 4 erroneous items—
(A) A disallowed Lifetime Learning Credit of $2,000 attributable to H;
(B) A disallowed business expense deduction of $8,000 attributable to H;
(C) Unreported income of $24,000 attributable to W; and
(D) Unreported self-employment tax of $14,000 attributable to W.
(ii) H and W both elect to allocate the deficiency.
(iii) The $2,000 Lifetime Learning Credit and the $14,000 self-employment tax are STIs totaling $16,000. The amount of erroneous items included in computing the proportionate allocation ratio is $32,000 ($24,000 unreported income and $8,000 disallowed business expense deduction). The amount of the deficiency subject to proportionate allocation is reduced by the amount of STIs ($28,000−$16,000 = $12,000).
(iv) Of the $32,000 of proportionate allocation items, $24,000 is allocable to W, and $8,000 is allocable to H.
W's share of allocable items
H's share of allocable items
3/4
($24,000/$32,000)
1/4
($8,000/$32,000)
(v) W's liability for the portion of the deficiency subject to proportionate allocation is limited to $9,000 (
3/4
of $12,000) and H's liability for such portion is limited to $3,000 (
1/4
of $12,000).
(vi) After the proportionate allocation is completed, the amount of the STIs is added to each spouse's allocated share of the deficiency.
W's share of total deficiency
H's share of total deficiency
$ 9,000
allocated deficiency
$3,000
allocated deficiency
14,000
self-employment tax
2,000
Lifetime Learning Credit
$23,000
$5,000
(vii) Therefore, W's liability is limited to $23,000 and H's liability is limited to $5,000.

# Example 5. Requesting spouse receives a benefit on the joint return from the nonrequesting spouse's erroneous item.
(i) In 2001, H reports gross income of $4,000 from his business on Schedule C, and W reports $50,000 of wage income. On their 2001 joint Federal income tax return, H deducts $20,000 of business expenses resulting in a net loss from his business of $16,000. H and W divorce in September 2002, and on May 22, 2003, a $5,200 deficiency is assessed with respect to their 2001 joint return. W elects to allocate the deficiency. The deficiency on the joint return results from a disallowance of all of H's $20,000 of deductions.
(ii) Since H used only $4,000 of the disallowed deductions to offset gross income from his business, W benefitted from the other $16,000 of the disallowed deductions used to offset her wage income. Therefore, $4,000 of the disallowed deductions are allocable to H and $16,000 of the disallowed deductions are allocable to W. W's liability is limited to $4,160 (
4/5
of $5,200). If H also elected to allocate the deficiency, H's election to
allocate the $4,160 of the deficiency to W would be invalid because H had actual knowledge of the erroneous items.

# Example 6. Calculation of requesting spouse's benefit on the joint return when the nonrequesting spouse's erroneous item is partially disallowed.
Assume the same facts as in Example 5, except that H deducts $18,000 for business expenses on the joint return, of which $16,000 are disallowed. Since H used only $2,000 of the $16,000 disallowed deductions to offset gross income from his business, W received benefit on the return from the other $14,000 of the disallowed deductions used to offset her wage income. Therefore, $2,000 of the disallowed deductions are allocable to H and $14,000 of the disallowed deductions are allocable to W. W's liability is limited to $4,550 (
7/8
of $5,200).
(6)
Alternative allocation methods
—(i)
Allocation based on applicable tax rates.
If a deficiency arises from two or more erroneous items that are subject to tax at different rates (e.g., ordinary income and capital gain items), the deficiency will be allocated after first separating the erroneous items into categories according to their applicable tax rate. After all erroneous items are categorized, a separate allocation is made with respect to each tax rate category using the proportionate allocation method of paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(ii)
Allocation methods provided in subsequent published guidance.
Additional alternative methods for allocating erroneous items under section 6015(c) may be prescribed by the Treasury and IRS in subsequent revenue rulings, revenue procedures, or other appropriate guidance.
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (d)(6):

# Example. Allocation based on applicable tax rates.
H and W timely file their 1998 joint Federal income tax return. H and W divorce in 1999. On July 13, 2001, a $5,100 deficiency is assessed with respect to H's and W's 1998 return. Of this deficiency, $2,000 results from unreported capital gain of $6,000 that is attributable to W and $4,000 of capital gain that is attributable to H (both gains being subject to tax at the 20% marginal rate). The remaining $3,100 of the deficiency is attributable to $10,000 of unreported dividend income of H that is subject to tax at a marginal rate of 31%. H and W both timely elect to allocate the deficiency, and qualify under this section to do so. There are erroneous items subject to different tax rates; thus, the alternative allocation method of this paragraph (d)(6) applies. The three erroneous items are first categorized according to their applicable tax rates, then allocated. Of the total amount of 20% tax rate items ($10,000), 60% is allocable to W and 40% is allocable to H. Therefore, 60% of the $2,000 deficiency attributable to these items (or $1,200) is allocated to W. The remaining 40% of this portion of the deficiency ($800) is allocated to H. The only 31% tax rate item is allocable to H. Accordingly, H is liable for $3,900 of the deficiency ($800 + $3,100), and W is liable for the remaining $1,200.

§ 1.6015-4
Equitable relief.
(a) A requesting spouse who files a joint return for which a liability remains unpaid and who does not qualify for full relief under § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3 may request equitable relief under this section. The Internal Revenue Service has the discretion to grant equitable relief from joint and several liability to a requesting spouse when, considering all of the facts and circumstances, it would be inequitable to hold the requesting spouse jointly and severally liable.
(b) This section may not be used to circumvent the limitation of § 1.6015-3(c)(1) (i.e., no refunds under § 1.6015-3). Therefore, relief is not available under this section to obtain a refund of liabilities already paid, for which the requesting spouse would otherwise qualify for relief under § 1.6015-3.
(c) For guidance concerning the criteria to be used in determining whether it is inequitable to hold a requesting spouse jointly and severally liable under this section, see Rev. Proc. 2000-15 (2000-1 C.B. 447), or other guidance published by the Treasury and IRS (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
[T.D. 9003, 67 FR 47285, July 18, 2002]
§ 1.6015-5
Time and manner for requesting relief.
(a)
Requesting relief.
To elect the application of § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3, or to request equitable relief under § 1.6015-4, a requesting spouse must file Form 8857, “Request for Innocent Spouse Relief” (or other specified form); submit a written statement containing the same information required on Form 8857, which is signed under penalties of perjury; or submit information in the
manner prescribed by the Treasury and IRS in forms, relevant revenue rulings, revenue procedures, or other published guidance (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(b)
Time period for filing a request for relief
—(1)
In general.
To elect the application of § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3, or to request equitable relief under § 1.6015-4, a requesting spouse must file Form 8857 or other similar statement with the Internal Revenue Service no later than two years from the date of the first collection activity against the requesting spouse after July 22, 1998, with respect to the joint tax liability.
(2)
Definitions
—(i)
Collection activity.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), collection activity means a section 6330 notice; an offset of an overpayment of the requesting spouse against a liability under section 6402; the filing of a suit by the United States against the requesting spouse for the collection of the joint tax liability; or the filing of a claim by the United States in a court proceeding in which the requesting spouse is a party or which involves property of the requesting spouse. Collection activity does not include a notice of deficiency; the filing of a Notice of Federal Tax Lien; or a demand for payment of tax. The term
property of the requesting spouse,
for purposes of this paragraph (b), means property in which the requesting spouse has an ownership interest (other than solely through the operation of community property laws), including property owned jointly with the nonrequesting spouse.
(ii)
Section 6330 notice.
A section 6330 notice refers to the notice sent, pursuant to section 6330, providing taxpayers notice of the Service's intent to levy and of their right to a collection due process (CDP) hearing.
(3)
Requests for relief made before commencement of collection activity.
An election or request for relief may be made before collection activity has commenced. For example, an election or request for relief may be made in connection with an audit or examination of the joint return or a demand for payment, or pursuant to the CDP hearing procedures under section 6320 in connection with the filing of a Notice of Federal Tax Lien. For more information on the rules regarding collection due process for liens, see the Treasury regulations under section 6320. However, no request for relief may be made before the date specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b):

# Example 1.
On January 11, 2000, a section 6330 notice is mailed to H and W regarding their 1997 joint Federal income tax liability. The Internal Revenue Service levies on W's employer on June 5, 2000. The Internal Revenue Service levies on H's employer on July 10, 2000. An election or request for relief must be made by January 11, 2002, which is two years after the Internal Revenue Service sent the section 6330 notice.

# Example 2.
The Internal Revenue Service offsets an overpayment against a joint liability for 1995 on January 12, 1998. The offset only partially satisfies the liability. The Internal Revenue Service takes no other collection actions. On July 24, 2001, W elects relief with respect to the unpaid portion of the 1995 liability. W's election is timely because the Internal Revenue Service has not taken any collection activity after July 22, 1998; therefore, the two-year period has not commenced.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2,
except that the Internal Revenue Service sends a section 6330 notice on January 22, 1999. W's election is untimely because it is filed more than two years after the first collection activity after July 22, 1998.

# Example 4.
H and W do not remit full payment with their timely filed joint Federal income tax return for the 1989 tax year. No collection activity is taken after July 22, 1998, until the United States files a suit against both H and W to reduce the tax assessment to judgment and to foreclose the tax lien on their jointly-held business property on July 1, 1999. H elects relief on October 2, 2000. The election is timely because it is made within two years of the filing of a collection suit by the United States against H.

# Example 5.
W files a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on July 10, 2000. On September 5, 2000, the United States files a proof of claim for her joint 1998 income tax liability. W elects relief with respect to the 1998 liability on August 20, 2002. The election is timely because it is made within two years of the date the United States filed the proof of claim in W's bankruptcy case.
(5)
Premature requests for relief.
The Internal Revenue Service will not consider premature claims for relief under § 1.6015-2, 1.6015-3, or 1.6015-4. A premature claim is a claim for relief that
is filed for a tax year prior to the receipt of a notification of an audit or a letter or notice from the IRS indicating that there may be an outstanding liability with regard to that year. Such notices or letters do not include notices issued pursuant to section 6223 relating to TEFRA partnership proceedings. A premature claim is not considered an election or request under § 1.6015-1(h)(5).
(c)
Effect of a final administrative determination
—(1)
In general.
A requesting spouse is entitled to only one final administrative determination of relief under § 1.6015-1 for a given assessment, unless the requesting spouse properly submits a second request for relief that is described in § 1.6015-1(h)(5).
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (c):

# Example:
In January 2001, W becomes a limited partner in partnership P, and in February 2001, she starts her own business from which she earns $100,000 of net income for the year. H and W file a joint return for tax year 2001, on which they claim $20,000 in losses from their investment in P, and they omit W's self-employment tax. In March 2003, the Internal Revenue Service commences an audit under the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code (TEFRA partnership proceeding) and sends H and W a notice under section 6223(a)(1). In September 2003, the Internal Revenue Service audits H's and W's 2001 joint return regarding the omitted self-employment tax. H may file a claim for relief from joint and several liability for the self-employment tax liability because he has received a notification of an audit indicating that there may be an outstanding liability on the joint return. However, his claim for relief regarding the TEFRA partnership proceeding is premature under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. H will have to wait until the Internal Revenue Service sends him a notice of computational adjustment or assesses the liability resulting from the TEFRA partnership proceeding before he files a claim for relief with respect to any such liability. The assessment relating to the TEFRA partnership proceeding is separate from the assessment for the self-employment tax; therefore, H's subsequent claim for relief for the liability from the TEFRA partnership proceeding is not precluded by his previous claim for relief from the self-employment tax liability under this paragraph (c).

§ 1.6015-6
Nonrequesting spouse's notice and opportunity to participate in administrative proceedings.
(a)
In general.
(1) When the Internal Revenue Service receives an election under § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3, or a request for relief under § 1.6015-4, the Internal Revenue Service must send a notice to the nonrequesting spouse's last known address that informs the nonrequesting spouse of the requesting spouse's claim for relief. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see § 301.6212-2 of this chapter. The notice must provide the nonrequesting spouse with an opportunity to submit any information that should be considered in determining whether the requesting spouse should be granted relief from joint and several liability. A nonrequesting spouse is not required to submit information under this section. Upon the request of either spouse, the Internal Revenue Service will share with one spouse the information submitted by the other spouse, unless such information would impair tax administration.
(2) The Internal Revenue Service must notify the nonrequesting spouse of the Service's preliminary and final determinations with respect to the requesting spouse's claim for relief under section 6015.
(b)
Information submitted.
The Internal Revenue Service will consider all of the information (as relevant to each particular relief provision) that the nonrequesting spouse submits in determining whether relief from joint and several liability is appropriate, including information relating to the following—
(1) The legal status of the requesting and nonrequesting spouses' marriage;
(2) The extent of the requesting spouse's knowledge of the erroneous items or underpayment;
(3) The extent of the requesting spouse's knowledge or participation in the family business or financial affairs;
(4) The requesting spouse's education level;
(5) The extent to which the requesting spouse benefitted from the erroneous items;
(6) Any asset transfers between the spouses;
(7) Any indication of fraud on the part of either spouse;
(8) Whether it would be inequitable, within the meaning of §§ 1.6015-2(d) and 1.6015-4, to hold the requesting spouse jointly and severally liable for the outstanding liability;
(9) The allocation or ownership of items giving rise to the deficiency; and
(10) Anything else that may be relevant to the determination of whether relief from joint and several liability should be granted.
(c)
Effect of opportunity to participate.
The failure to submit information pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section does not affect the nonrequesting spouse's ability to seek relief from joint and several liability for the same tax year. However, information that the nonrequesting spouse submits pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section is relevant in determining whether relief from joint and several liability is appropriate for the nonrequesting spouse should the nonrequesting spouse also submit an application for relief.
[T.D. 9003, 67 FR 47285, July 18, 2002]
§ 1.6015-7
Tax Court review.
(a)
In general.
Requesting spouses may petition the Tax Court to review the denial of relief under § 1.6015-1.
(b)
Time period for petitioning the Tax Court.
Pursuant to section 6015(e), the requesting spouse may petition the Tax Court to review a denial of relief under § 1.6015-1 within 90 days after the date notice of the Service's final determination is mailed by certified or registered mail (90-day period). If the IRS does not mail the requesting spouse a final determination letter within 6 months of the date the requesting spouse files an election under § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3, the requesting spouse may petition the Tax Court to review the election at any time after the expiration of the 6-month period, and before the expiration of the 90-day period. The Tax Court also may review a claim for relief if Tax Court jurisdiction has been acquired under another section of the Internal Revenue Code such as section 6213(a) or 6330(d).
(c)
Restrictions on collection and suspension of the running of the period of limitations
—(1)
Restrictions on collection under § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3.
Unless the Internal Revenue Service determines that collection will be jeopardized by delay, no levy or proceeding in court shall be made, begun, or prosecuted against a requesting spouse electing the application of § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3 for the collection of any assessment to which the election relates until the expiration of the 90-day period described in paragraph (b) of this section, or if a petition is filed with the Tax Court, until the decision of the Tax Court becomes final under section 7481. For more information regarding the date on which a decision of the Tax Court becomes final, see section 7481 and the regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the above, if the requesting spouse appeals the Tax Court's decision, the Internal Revenue Service may resume collection of the liability from the requesting spouse on the date the requesting spouse files the notice of appeal, unless the requesting spouse files an appeal bond pursuant to the rules of section 7485. Jeopardy under this paragraph (c)(1) means conditions exist that would require an assessment under section 6851 or 6861 and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Waiver of the restrictions on collection.
A requesting spouse may, at any time (regardless of whether a notice of the Service's final determination of relief is mailed), waive the restrictions on collection in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(3)
Suspension of the running of the period of limitations
—(i)
Relief under § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3.
The running of the period of limitations in section 6502 on collection against the requesting spouse of the assessment to which an election under § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3 relates is suspended for the period during which the Internal Revenue Service is prohibited by paragraph (c)(1) of this section from collecting by levy or a proceeding in court and for 60 days thereafter. However, if the requesting spouse signs a waiver of the restrictions on collection in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the suspension of the period of limitations in section 6502 on collection against the requesting spouse will terminate on the date that is 60 days after the date the waiver is filed with the Internal Revenue Service.
(ii)
Relief under § 1.6015-4.
If a requesting spouse seeks only equitable relief under § 1.6015-4, the restrictions on collection of paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply. Accordingly, the request for relief does not suspend the running of the period of limitations on collection.
(4)
Definitions
—(i)
Levy.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), levy means an administrative levy or seizure described by section 6331.
(ii)
Proceedings in court.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), proceedings in court means suits filed by the United States for the collection of Federal tax. Proceedings in court does not refer to the filing of pleadings and claims and other participation by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States in suits not filed by the United States, including Tax Court cases, refund suits, and bankruptcy cases.
(iii)
Assessment to which the election relates.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), the assessment to which the election relates is the entire assessment of the deficiency to which the election relates, even if the election is made with respect to only part of that deficiency.

§ 1.6015-8
Applicable liabilities.
(a)
In general.
Section 6015 applies to liabilities that arise after July 22, 1998, and to liabilities that arose prior to July 22, 1998, that were not paid on or before July 22, 1998.
(b)
Liabilities paid on or before July 22, 1998.
A requesting spouse seeking relief from joint and several liability for amounts paid on or before July 22, 1998, must request relief under section 6013(e) and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1.
H and W file a joint Federal income tax return for 1995 on April 15, 1996. There is an understatement on the return attributable to an omission of H's wage income. On October 15, 1998, H and W receive a 30-day letter proposing a deficiency on the 1995 joint return. W pays the outstanding liability in full on November 30, 1998. In March 1999, W files Form 8857, requesting relief from joint and several liability under section 6015(b). Although W's liability arose prior to July 22, 1998, it was unpaid as of that date. Therefore, section 6015 is applicable.

# Example 2.
H and W file their 1995 joint Federal income tax return on April 15, 1996. On October 14, 1997, a deficiency of $5,000 is assessed regarding a disallowed business expense deduction attributable to H. On June 30, 1998, the Internal Revenue Service levies on the $3,000 in W's bank account in partial satisfaction of the outstanding liability. On August 31, 1998, W files a request for relief from joint and several liability. The liability arose prior to July 22, 1998. Section 6015 is applicable to the $2,000 that remained unpaid as of July 22, 1998, and section 6013(e) is applicable to the $3,000 that was paid prior to July 22, 1998.

§ 1.6015-9
Effective date.
Sections 1.6015-0 through 1.6015-9 are applicable for all elections under § 1.6015-2 or 1.6015-3 or any requests for relief under § 1.6015-4 filed on or after July 18, 2002.
[T.D. 9003, 67 FR 47285, July 18, 2002]
§ 1.6016-1
Declarations of estimated income tax by corporations.
(a)
Requirement.
For taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1955, a declaration of estimated tax shall be made by every corporation (including unincorporated business enterprises electing to be taxed as domestic corporations under section 1361), which is subject to taxation under section 11 or 1201(a), or subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to insurance companies), if its income tax under such sections or such subchapter L for the taxable year can reasonably be expected to exceed the sum of $100,000 plus the amount of any estimated credits allowable under section 32 (relating to tax withheld at source on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations and on tax-free covenant bonds), section 33 (relating to taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States), and section 38 (relating to investment in certain depreciable property).
(b)
Definition of estimated tax.
The term “estimated tax”, in the case of a corporation, means the excess of the amount which such corporation estimates as its income tax liability for the taxable year under section 11 or 1201(a), or subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, over the sum of $100,000 and any estimated credits under sections 32, 33, and 38. However, for the rule
with respect to the limitation upon the $100,000 exemption for members of certain electing affiliated groups, see section 243(b)(3)(C)(v) and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Examples.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
M, a corporation subject to tax under section 11, reasonably anticipates that it will have taxable income of $224,000 for the calendar year 1964. The normal tax and surtax result in an expected liability of $105,000. M determines that it will not have any allowable credits under sections 32, 33, and 38 for 1964. Since M's expected tax ($105,000) exceeds the exemption ($100,000), a declaration of estimated tax is required to be filed, reporting an estimated tax of $5,000 ($105,000−$100,000) for the calendar year 1964.

# Example 2.
Under the facts stated in example (1), except that M estimates it will have an allowable foreign tax credit under section 33 in the amount of $4,000 and an allowable investment credit under section 38 in the amount of $3,000, no declaration is required, since M's expected tax ($105,000) does not exceed the $100,000 plus the allowable credits totaling $7,000.
[T.D. 6768, 29 FR 14921, Nov. 4, 1964]
§ 1.6016-2
Contents of declaration of estimated tax.
(a)
In general.
The declaration of estimated tax by a corporation shall be made on Form 1120-ES. For the purpose of making the declaration, the estimated tax should be based upon the amount of gross income which the taxpayer can reasonably be expected to receive or accrue as the case may be, depending upon the method of accounting upon the basis of which the taxable income is computed, and the amount of the estimated allowable deductions and credits to be taken into account. Such amounts of gross income, deductions, and credits should be determined upon the basis of facts and circumstances existing as at the time prescribed for the filing of the declaration as well as those reasonably to be anticipated for the taxable year.
(b)
Use of prescribed form.
Copies of Form 1120-ES will so far as possible be furnished taxpayers by district directors. A taxpayer will not be excused from making a declaration, however, by the fact that no form has been furnished. Taxpayers not supplied with the proper form should make application therefor to the district director in ample time to have their declarations prepared, verified, and filed with the district director on or before the date prescribed for filing the declaration. If the prescribed form is not available a statement disclosing the estimated income tax after the exemption and the credits, if any, should be filed as a tentative declaration within the prescribed time, accompanied by the payment of the required installment. Such tentative declaration should be supplemented, without unnecessary delay, by a declaration made on the proper form.
§ 1.6016-3
Amendment of declaration.
In the making of a declaration of estimated tax the corporation is required to take into account the then existing facts and circumstances as well as those reasonably to be anticipated relating to prospective gross income, allowable deductions, and estimated credits for the taxable year. Amended or revised declarations may be made in any case in which the corporation estimates that its gross income, deductions, or credits will materially change the estimated tax reported in the previous declaration. However, for the rule with respect to the number of amended declarations which may be filed for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, see paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.6074-1. Such amended declaration may be made on either Form 1120-ES (marked “Amended”) or on the reverse side of the installment notice furnished the corporation by the district director. See, however, paragraph (b) of § 1.6016-2 for procedure to be followed if the prescribed form is not available.
[T.D. 6768, 29 FR 14922, Nov. 4, 1964]
§ 1.6016-4
Short taxable year.
(a)
Requirement of declaration.
No declaration may be made for a period of more than 12 months. For purposes of this section a taxable year of 52 or 53 weeks, in the case of a corporation which computes its taxable income in accordance with the election permitted by section 441(f), shall be deemed a period of 12 months. For special rules affecting the time for filing declarations and paying estimated tax by such corporation, see paragraph (b) of § 1.441-2. A separate declaration is required
where a corporation is required to submit an income tax return for a period of less than 12 months, but only if such short period ends on or after December 31, 1955. However, no declaration is required if the short taxable year:
(1) Begins on or before December 31, 1963, and is:
(i) A period of less than 9 months, or
(ii) A period of 9 or more months but less than 12 months and the requirements of section 6016(a) are not met before the 1st day of the last month in the short taxable year, or
(2) Begins after December 31, 1963, and is:
(i) A period of less than 4 months, or
(ii) A period of 4 or more months but less than 12 months and the requirements of section 6016(a) are not met before the 1st day of the last month in the short taxable year.
(b)
Income placed on an annual basis.
In cases where the short taxable year results from a change of annual accounting period, for the purpose of determining whether the anticipated income for a short taxable year will result in an estimated tax liability requiring the filing of a declaration, such income shall be placed on an annual basis in the manner prescribed in section 443(b)(1). If a tax computed on such annualized income exceeds the sum of $100,000 and any credits under part IV, of subchapter A, chapter 1 of the Code, the estimated tax shall be the same part of the excess so computed as the number of months in the short period is of 12 months. Thus, for example, a corporation which changes from a calendar year basis to a fiscal year basis beginning October 1, 1956, will have a short taxable year beginning January 1, 1956, and ending September 30, 1956. If on or before August 31, 1956, the taxpayer anticipates that it will have income of $264,000 for the 9-month taxable year the estimated tax is computed as follows:
(1) Anticipated taxable income for 9 months
$264,000
(2) Annualized income ($264,000 × 12 ÷ 9)
352,000
(3) Tax liability on item (2)
177,540
(4) Item (3) reduced by $100,000 (there are no credits under part IV, subchapter A, chapter 1 of the Code)
77,540
(5) Estimated tax for 9-month period ($77,540 × 9 ÷ 12)
58,155
Since the tax liability on the annualized income is in excess of $100,000, a declaration is required to be filed, reporting an estimated tax of $58,155 for the 9-month taxable period. This paragraph has no application where the short taxable year does not result from a change in the taxpayer's annual accounting period.

In general.
(1) Every individual, other than a nonresident alien, having net earnings from self-employment, as defined in section 1402, of $400 or more for the taxable year shall make a return of such earnings. For purposes of this section, an individual who is a resident of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, or (for any taxable year beginning after 1960) Guam or American Samoa is not to be considered a nonresident alien individual. See paragraph (d) of § 1.1402(b)-1. A return is required under this section if an individual has self-employment income, as defined in section 1402(b), even though he may not be required to make a return under section 6012 for purposes of the tax imposed by section 1 or 3. Provisions applicable to returns under section 6012(a) shall be applicable to returns under this section.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the return required by this section shall be made on Form 1040. The form to be used by residents of the Virgin Islands, Guam, or American Samoa is From 1040SS. In the case of a resident of Puerto Rico who is not required to make a return of income under section 6012(a), the form to be used is Form 1040SS, except that Form 1040PR shall be used if it is furnished by the Internal Revenue Service to such resident for use in lieu of Form 1040SS.
(b)
Joint returns.
(1) In the case of a husband and wife filing a joint return under section 6013, the tax on self-employment income is computed on the separate self-employment income of each spouse, and not on the aggregate of the two amounts. The requirement of section 6013(d)(3) that in the case of a joint return the tax is computed on the aggregate income of the spouses is
not applicable with respect to the tax on self-employment income. Where the husband and wife each has net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more, it will be necessary for each to complete separate schedules of the computation of self-employment tax with respect to the net earnings of each spouse, despite the fact that a joint return is filed. If the net earnings from self-employment of either the husband or the wife are less than $400, such net earnings are not subject to the tax on self-employment income, even though they must be shown on the joint return for purposes of the tax imposed by section 1 or 3.
(2) Except as otherwise expressly provided, section 6013 is applicable to the return of the tax on self-employment income; therefore, the liability with respect to such tax in the case of a joint return is joint and several.
(c)
Social security account numbers.
(1) Every individual making a return of net earnings from self-employment for any period commencing before January 1, 1962, is required to show thereon his social security account number, or, if he has no such account number, to make application therefor on Form SS-5 before filing such return. However, the failure to apply for or receive a social security account number will not excuse the individual from the requirement that he file such return on or before the due date thereof. Form SS-5 may be obtained from any district office of the Social Security Administration or from any district director. The application shall be filed with a district office of the Social Security Administration or, in the case of an individual not in the United States, with the district office of the Social Security Administration at Baltimore, Md. An individual who has previously secured a social security account number as an employee shall use that account number on his return of net earnings from self-employment.
(2) For provisions applicable to the securing of identifying numbers and the reporting thereof on returns and schedules for periods commencing after December 31, 1961, see § 1.6109-1.
(d)
Declaration of estimated tax with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, section 6015 provides that the term “estimated tax” includes the amount which an individual estimates as the amount of self-employment tax imposed by chapter 2 for the taxable year. Thus, individuals upon whom self-employment tax is imposed by section 1401 must make a declaration of estimated tax if they meet the requirements of section 6015(a); except as otherwise provided under section 6015(i).
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12108, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6691, 28 FR 12816, Dec. 3, 1963; T.D. 7427, 41 FR 34028, Aug. 12, 1976]

) of this chapter), provide for an exception to partnership reporting under section 6031 and for conditions for the exception, if all or substantially all of a partnership's income is derived from the holding or disposition of tax-exempt obligations (as defined in section 1275(a)(3) and § 1.1275-1(e)) or shares in a
regulated investment company (as defined in section 851(a)) that pays exempt-interest dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(5)).

—(1)
General rule.

Filing requirement.
A foreign partnership is not required to file a partnership return, if the foreign partnership does not have gross income that is (or is treated as) effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (ECI) and does not have gross income (including gains) derived from sources within the United States (U.S.-source income). Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, a foreign partnership that has ECI or has U.S.-source income that is not ECI must file a partnership return for its taxable year in accordance with the rules for domestic partnerships in paragraph (a) of this section.
(ii)
Special rule.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1) and paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, a foreign partnership will not be considered to have derived income from sources within the United States solely because a U.S. partner marks to market his pro rata share of PFIC stock held by the foreign partnership pursuant to an election under section 1296.
(2)
Foreign partnerships with de minimis U.S.-source income and de minimis U.S. partners.
A foreign partnership (other than a withholding foreign partnership, as defined in § 1.1441-5(c)(2)(i)) that has $20,000 or less of U.S.-source income and has no ECI during its taxable year is not required to file a partnership return if, at no time during the partnership taxable year, one percent or more of any item of partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit is allocable in the aggregate to direct United States partners. The United States partners must directly report their shares of the allocable items of partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit.
(3)
Filing obligations for certain other foreign partnerships with no ECI
—(i)
General requirements for modified filing obligations.
A foreign partnership will be subject to the modified filing obligations in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section if, in addition to satisfying the requirements contained in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section—
(A) The partnership is not a withholding foreign partnership as defined in § 1.1441-5(c)(2)(i);
(B) Forms 1042 and 1042-S are filed by the partnership with respect to the amounts subject to reporting under § 1.1461-1(b) and (c), unless the partnership is not required to file such returns under § 1.1461-1(b)(2) and (c)(4), in which case Forms 1042 and 1042-S must be filed by another withholding agent or agents; and
(C) The tax liability of the partners with respect to such amounts has been fully satisfied by the withholding of tax at the source, if applicable, under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(ii)
Foreign partnerships with U.S.-source income but no U.S. partners.
A foreign partnership that has U.S.-source income is not required to file a partnership return if the partnership has no ECI and no United States partners at any time during the partnership's taxable year.
(iii)
Foreign partnerships with U.S.-source income and U.S. partners.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a foreign partnership with one or more United States partners that has U.S.-source income but no ECI must file a partnership return. However, such a foreign partnership need not file Statements of Partner's Share of Income, Credit, Deduction, etc. (Schedules K-1) for any partners other than its direct United States partners and its passthrough partners (whether U.S. or foreign) through which United States partners hold an interest in the foreign partnership. Schedules K-1 that are not excepted from filing under this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) must contain the same information required of a domestic partnership filing under paragraph (a) of this section.
(4)
Information or returns required of partners who are United States persons
—(i)
In general.
If a United States person is a partner in a partnership that is not required to file a partnership return, the district director or director of the
relevant service center may require that person to render the statements or provide the information necessary to verify the accuracy of the reporting by that person of any items of partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit.
(ii)
Controlled foreign partnerships.
Certain United States persons who are partners in a foreign partnership controlled (within the meaning of section 6038(e)(1)) by United States persons may be required to provide information with respect to the partnership under section 6038.
(5)
Certain partnership elections.
For a partnership that is not otherwise required to file a partnership return, if an election that can only be made by the partnership under section 703 (affecting the computation of taxable income derived from a partnership) is to be made by or for the partnership, a return on the form prescribed for the partnership return must be filed for the partnership. Unless otherwise provided in the form or the accompanying instructions, a return filed solely to make an election need only contain a written statement citing paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, listing the name and address of the partnership making the election, and clearly identifying the specific election being made. A return filed under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section solely to make an election is not a partnership return. Thus, such a return is not a return filed under section 6031(a) for purposes of sections 6501 (except regarding the specific election issue), 6231(a)(1)(A), and 6233. The return must be signed by—
(i) Each partner that is a partner in the partnership at the time the election is made; or
(ii) Any partner of the partnership who is authorized (under local law or the partnership's organizational documents) to make the election and who represents to having such authorization under penalties of perjury.
(6)
Exclusion for certain organizations.
The return requirement of section 6031 and this section does not apply to the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, the International Maritime Satellite Organization, or any organization that is a successor of either.
(7)
Filing obligation for certain partners of certain foreign partnerships with respect to base erosion payments.
If a foreign partnership is not required to file a partnership return and the foreign partnership has made a payment or accrual that is treated as a base erosion payment of a partner as provided in § 1.59A-7(c), a partner in the foreign partnership who is a person required to file a Form 8991 (or successor) must include the information necessary to report those base erosion payments and base erosion tax benefits on Form 8991 (or successor) in accordance with the related instructions. A partner with a Form 8991 (or successor) filing requirement who is a partner in a foreign partnership that is not required to file a partnership return must obtain the necessary information to report any base erosion payments on Form 8991 (or successor) from the foreign partnership or from any other reliable records of these payments. This paragraph does not apply to any partner described in § 1.59A-7(d)(2).

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the modification or revocation of a statement furnished to a nominee is effective for a partnership taxable year if and only if the partnership notifies the nominee of such modification or revocation by a written statement more than 60 days before the beginning of the partnership taxable year. The nominee shall retain a copy of any statement that is furnished to it by the partnership under this paragraph (a)(4) in the nominee's records so long as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law.

(B) The nominee knows or has reason to know of such election more than 60 days before the beginning of such taxable year.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a):

# Example 1.
B, a broker, holds 50 units of interest in Partnership P, a calendar year partnership, in street name for customer A, the beneficial owner. B holds the units on behalf of A at all times during 1989. B must furnish a statement to P for calendar year 1989 under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section that includes the information required under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) (A) through (D) of this section. The description of the partnership interest held by B on A's behalf on January 1, 1989, must identify the number of units of P held by B on A's behalf at that time (50), and the class of the partnership interest (including the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number of the partnership interest, if known).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that pursuant to A's instructions, B sells 25 of A's units of interest in P on August 1, 1989, receiving net proceeds from the transfer of $500. In addition to the information described in example (1), the statement that B must furnish to P must include the class of the partnership interest transferred (including the CUSIP number of the partnership interest, if known), the number of units transferred (25), the net proceeds from the transfer ($500), and the date of the transfer (August 1, 1989.)

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that A is not the beneficial owner, but rather holds the units as a nominee on behalf of C, the beneficial owner, at all times during 1989. In addition to the statement that B must furnish to P (as described in Example (1) of this paragraph (a)(5)), A must furnish a statement to P for calendar year 1989 under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section that includes the information required under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) (A) through (D) of this section. If both A and B provide P with the statement required under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, P must provide C with the statement required under § 1.6031(b)-1T (a)(1).
(b)
Time for furnishing statements.
A nominee may furnish to the partnership any statement required under paragraph (a) of this section annually, quarterly, monthly, or on any other basis, provided that all statements required to be furnished under paragraph (a) of this section for a partnership taxable year shall be furnished on or before the last day of the first month following the close of such partnership taxable year.
(c)
Use of magnetic media.
A nominee required to furnish a written statement under paragraph (a) of this section, may, in lieu of furnishing such written statement, furnish the required information on magnetic tape or by other media if the partnership and the nominee so agree.
(d)
Use of single document.
Any person who holds interests in a partnership as a nominee on behalf of more than one other person during the partnership taxable year, may, in lieu of furnishing to the partnership a separate statement for each such other person, furnish to the partnership a single document which includes, for each such
other person, the information described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. To the extent that a single document is used, references in this section to the statement required under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section shall be deemed to refer also to the information included in a single document under this paragraph (d).

Nominee reporting of REMIC information (temporary). [Reserved]
§ 1.6032-1
Returns of banks with respect to common trust funds.
(a) Every bank (as defined in section 581) maintaining a common trust fund shall make a return of income of the common trust fund, regardless of the amount of its taxable income. Member banks of an affiliated group that serve as co-trustees with respect to a common trust fund must act jointly in making a return for the fund. If a bank maintains more than one common trust fund, a separate return shall be made for each. No particular form is prescribed for making the return under this section, but Form 1065 may be used if it is designated by the bank as the return of a common trust fund. The return shall be made for the taxable year of the common trust fund and shall be filed on or before the date prescribed by section 6072(b) with the service center prescribed in the relevant Internal Revenue Service revenue procedure, publication, form, or instructions to the form (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). Such return shall state specifically with respect to the fund the items of gross income and the deductions allowed by subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, shall include each participant's name and address, the participant's proportionate share of taxable income or net loss (exclusive of gains and losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets), the participant's proportionate share of gains and losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets, and the participant's share of items which enter into the determination of the tax imposed by section 56. See §§ 1.584-2 and 1.58-5. If the common trust fund is maintained by two or more banks that are members of the same affiliated group, the return must also identify the member bank in the group that has contributed each participant's property or money to the fund. A copy of the plan of the common trust fund must be filed with the return. If, however, a copy of such plan has once been filed with a return, it need not again be filed if the return contains a statement showing when and where it was filed. If the plan is amended in any way after such copy has been filed, a copy of the amendment must be filed with the return for the taxable year in which the amendment was made. For the signing of a return of a bank with respect to common trust funds, see § 1.6062-1, relating to the manner prescribed for the signing of a return of a corporation.
(b) This section applies to returns filed on or after January 30, 2020. Section 1.6032-1T (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2019) applies to taxable years beginning before January 30, 2020.

§ 1.6033-1
Returns by exempt organizations; taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970.
(a)
In general.
(1) Except as provided in section 6033(a) and paragraph (g) of this section, every organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) shall file an annual return of information specifically stating its items of gross income, receipts and disbursements, and such other information as may be prescribed in the instructions issued with respect to the return. Such information return shall be filed annually regardless of the amount or source of the income or receipts of the organization. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, such return shall be filed annually regardless of whether such organization is chartered by, or affiliated or associated with, any central, parent, or other organization.
(2)(i) Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, every organization exempt from taxation under section 501 (a), and required to file a return under section 6033 and this section, other than an organization described in section 401 (a), 501(c)(3), or 501(d), shall file its annual return on Form 990. However, such an exempt organization, instead of filing Form 990, may file its annual return on Form 990 (SF), a short form, if its gross receipts for the taxable year do not exceed $10,000 and its total assets on the last day of its taxable year do not exceed $10,000.
(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, “gross receipts” means the gross amount received by the organization during its annual accounting period from all sources without reduction for any costs or expenses including, for example, cost of goods or assets sold, cost of operations, or expenses of earning, raising, or collecting such amounts. Thus, “gross receipts” includes, but is not limited to, (
a
) the gross amount received as contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts without reduction for the expenses of raising and collecting such amounts, (
b
) the gross amount received as dues or assessments from members or affiliated organizations without reduction for expenses attributable to the receipt of such amounts, (
c
) gross sales or receipts from business activities (including business activities unrelated to the purpose for which the organization received an exemption, the net income or loss from which may be required to be reported on Form 990-T), (
d
) the gross amount received from the sale of assets without reduction for cost or other basis and expenses of sale, and (
e
) the gross amount received as investment income such as interest, dividends, rents, and royalties.
(3) Every employees' trust described in section 401 (a) which is exempt from taxation under section 501 (a) shall file an annual return on Form 990-P. The return shall include the information required by paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of § 1.401-1. In addition, the trust must file the information required to be filed by the employer pursuant to the provisions of § 1.404(a)-2, unless the employer has notified the trustee in writing that he has or will timely file such information. If the trustee has received such notification from the employer, then such notification, or a copy thereof, shall be retained by the trust as a part of its records.
(4) Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, every organization described in section 501(c)(3), which is required to file a return under section 6033 and this section, shall file its annual return on Form 990-A. However, such an exempt organization, instead of filing Form 990-A, may file its annual return on Form 990-A (SF), a short form, if its gross receipts for the taxable year do not exceed $10,000 and its total assets on the last day of its taxable year do not exceed $10,000. For purposes of this subparagraph, “gross receipts” shall be defined in the manner prescribed in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph. The forms prescribed by this subparagraph shall be as follows:
(i) Form 990-A shall consist of parts I and II. Part I shall contain, in addition to information required in part II, such information as may be prescribed in
the return and instructions which is required to be furnished by section 6033(a) or which is necessary to show whether or not such organization is exempt from tax under section 501(a). Part II, which shall be open to public inspection pursuant to section 6104 and other applicable sections and the regulations thereunder, shall contain principally the information required by section 6033(b) and the regulations thereunder. The information contained in part II, to be furnished by the organization in duplicate in the manner prescribed by the instructions issued with respect to the return, is as follows:
(
a
) Its gross income for the year. For this purpose, gross income includes tax-exempt income, but does not include contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts received. Whether or not an item constitutes a contribution, gift, grant, or similar amount, depends upon all the surrounding facts and circumstances.
(
b
) Its expenses attributable to such income and incurred within the year.
(
c
) Its disbursements out of income (including prior years' accumulations) made within the year for the purposes for which it is exempt. Information shall be included as to the class of activity with a separate total for each activity as well as the name, address, and amount received by each individual or organization receiving cash, other property, or services within the taxable year. If the donee is related by blood, marriage, adoption, or employment (including children of employees) to any person or corporation having an interest in the exempt organization, such as a creator, donor, director, trustee, or officer, the relationship of the donee shall be stated. Activities shall be classified according to purpose in greater detail than merely charitable, educational, religious, or scientific. For example, payments for nursing service, for laboratory construction, for fellowships, or for assistance to indigent families shall be so identified. Where the fair market value of the property at the time of disbursement is used as the measure of the disbursement, the book value of such property (and a statement of how book value was determined) shall also be furnished, and any difference between the fair market value at the time of disbursement and the book value should be reflected in the books of account. The expenses allocable to making the disbursements shall be set forth in such detail as is prescribed by the form or instructions.
(
d
) Its accumulation of income within the year. The amount of such accumulation is obtained by subtracting from the amount in (
a
) of this subdivision the sum of the amounts determined in (
b
) and (
c
) of this subdivision and the expenses allocable to carrying out the purposes for which it is exempt.
(
e
) Its aggregate accumulation of income at the beginning and end of the year. The aggregate accumulation of income shall be divided between that which is attributable to the gain or loss on the sale of assets (excluding inventory items) and that which is attributable to all other income. For this purpose expenses and disbursements shall be allocated on the basis of accounting records, the governing instrument, or applicable local law.
(
f
) Its disbursements out of principal in the current and prior years for the purposes for which it is exempt. In addition, the same type of information shall be required with respect to disbursements out of principal made in the current year as is prescribed by (
c
) of this subdivision with respect to disbursements out of income.
(
g
) A balance sheet showing its assets, liabilities, and net worth as of the beginning and end of such year. Detailed information on the assets, liabilities, and net worth shall be furnished on the schedule provided for this purpose on the Form 990-A. Such schedule shall be supplemented by attachments where appropriate.
(
h
) The total of the contributions and gifts received by it during the year. A statement shall be included showing the gross amount of contributions and gifts collected by the organization, the expenses incurred by the organization in collecting such amount, and the net proceeds.
(
i
) In addition to the information required in (
a
) through (
h
) of this subdivision, the organization shall furnish such specific information and answer
such specific questions as are required by the form or instructions.
(ii) Form 990-A (SF) is a short form consisting of a single part which contains such information as may be prescribed in the return and instructions which is required to be furnished by section 6033(a) or which is necessary to show whether or not such organization is exempt from tax under section 501(a). In addition, Form 990-A (SF) shall contain the information required by section 6033(b) which must be furnished in the manner prescribed in the instructions issued with respect to the return. Form 990-A (SF) shall be open to public inspection pursuant to section 6104 and other applicable sections and the regulations thereunder.
(5)(i) Every religious or apostolic association or corporation described in section 501 (d) which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) shall file a return on Form 1065 for each taxable year, stating specifically the items of gross income and deductions, and its taxable income. There shall be attached to the return as a part thereof a statement showing the name and address of each member of the association or corporation and the amount of his distributive share of the taxable income of the association or corporation for such year.
(ii) If the taxable year of any member is different from the taxable year of the association or corporation, the distributive share of the taxable income of the association or corporation to be included in the gross income of the member for his taxable year shall be based upon the taxable income of the association or corporation for its taxable year ending with or within the taxable year of the member.
(b)
Accounting period for filing return.
A return on Form 990, 990-A, 990 (SF), 990-A (SF), or 990-P shall be on the basis of the established annual accounting period of the organization. If the organization has no such established accounting period, such return shall be on the basis of the calendar year.
(c)
Returns when exempt status not established.
An information return on Form 990, 990-A, 990 (SF), or 990-A (SF) is not required to be filed by an organization claiming an exempt status under section 501(a) prior to the establishment by the organization of such exempt status under section 501 and § 1.501(a)-1. If the date for filing an income tax return and paying the tax occurs before the tax-exempt status of the organization has been established, the organization is required to file the income tax return and pay the tax. However, see sections 6081 and 6161 and the regulations thereunder for extensions of time for filing the return and paying the tax. Upon establishment of its exempt status, the organization may file a claim for a refund of income taxes paid for the period for which its exempt status is established.
(d)
Group returns.
(1) A central, parent, or like organization (referred to in this paragraph as “central organization”), exempt under section 501(a) and described in section 501(c), although required to file a separate annual return for itself under section 6033 and paragraph (a) of this section, may file annually, in addition to such separate annual return, a group return on Form 990 or 990-A, 990 (SF), or 990-A (SF), as may be appropriate. Form 990 (SF) or 990-A (SF) may be used where each local organization qualifies under paragraph (a) of this section. Such group return may be filed for two or more of the local organizations, chapters, or the like (referred to in this paragraph as “local organizations”) which are (i) affiliated with such central organization at the close of its annual accounting period, (ii) subject to the general supervision or control of the central organization, and (iii) exempt from taxation under the same paragraph of section 501(c) of the Code, although the local organizations are not necessarily exempt under the paragraph under which the central organization is exempt.
(2)(i) The filing of the group return shall be in lieu of the filing of a separate return by each of the local organizations included in the group return. The group return shall include only those local organizations which in writing have authorized the central organization to include them in the group return, and which have made and filed, with the central organization, their statements, specifically stating their items of gross income, receipts,
and disbursements, and such other information relating to them as is required to be stated in the group return. Such an authorization by a local organization shall be made annually, under the penalties of perjury, and shall be signed by a duly authorized officer of the local organization in his official capacity and shall contain the following statement, or a statement of like import: “I hereby declare under the penalties of perjury that this authorization (including any accompanying schedules and statements) has been examined by me and to the best of my knowledge and belief is true, correct and complete and made in good faith for the taxable year stated.” Such authorizations and statements shall be permanently retained by the central organization.
(ii) There shall be attached to the group return and made a part thereof a schedule showing the name and address of each of the local organizations and the total number thereof included in such return, and a schedule showing the name and address of each of the local organizations and the total number thereof not included in the group return.
(3) The group return shall be on the basis of the established annual accounting period of the central organization. Where such central organization has no established annual accounting period, such return shall be on the basis of the calendar year. The same income, receipts, and disbursements of a local organization shall not be included in more than one group return.
(4) The group return shall be filed in accordance with these regulations and the instructions issued with respect to Form 990, 990-A, 990 (SF), or 990-A (SF), whichever is appropriate, and shall be considered the return of each local organization included therein. The tax-exempt status of a local organization must be established under a group exemption letter issued to the central organization before a group return including the local organization will be considered as the return of the local organization. See § 1.501(a)-1 for requirements for establishing a tax-exempt status.
(e)
Time and place for filing.
The annual return of information on Form 990, 990-A, 990 (SF), 990-A (SF), or 990-P shall be filed on or before the 15th day of the fifth calendar month following the close of the period for which the return is required to be filed. The annual return on Form 1065 required to be filed by a religious or apostolic association or corporation shall be filed on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year for which the return is required to be filed. Each such return shall be filed in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto.
(f)
Penalties.
For criminal penalties for failure to file a return and filing a false or fraudulent return, see sections 7203, 7206, and 7207.
(g)
Organizations not required to file annual returns.
(1)(i) Annual returns on Form 990-A or Form 990-A (SF) are not required to be filed by an organization described in section 501(c)(3) which has established its right to exemption from taxation under section 501 (a) and which is:
(
a
) Organized and operated exclusively for religious purposes;
(
b
) Operated, supervised, or controlled by or in connection with an organization which is organized and operated exclusively for religious purposes;
(
c
) An educational organization which normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly organized body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on; or
(
d
) A charitable organization, or an organization for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, which is supported, in whole or in part, by funds contributed by the United States or any State or political subdivision thereof, or which is primarily supported by contributions of the general public.
(ii) An educational organization which normally maintains and has a regular faculty, curriculum, and student body and meets the conditions of subdivision (i)(
c
) of this subparagraph, which relieves it from the requirement of filing annual returns, shall not be considered as having thereafter failed to continue meeting such conditions if
it is temporarily compelled to curtail or discontinue its normal and regular activities during the existence of abnormal circumstances and conditions.
(iii) An organization organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals is “primarily supported by contributions of the general public” for any accounting period if more than 50 percent of its income and receipts for such period is actually derived from voluntary contributions and gifts made by the general public, as distinguished from a few contributors or donors or from related or associated persons. For purposes of this subdivision, the words “related or associated persons” refer to persons of a particular group who are connected with or are interested in the activities of the organization, such as founders, incorporators, shareholders, members, fiduciaries, officers, employees, or the like, or who are connected with such persons by family or business relationships. An organization claiming an exception from the filing of an information return under this subdivision must maintain adequate records in order to substantiate such claim. Furthermore, if it is doubtful to an organization that it falls within this exception for filing annual information returns, it must file the return on Form 990-A or Form 990-A (SF).
(2) The annual return on Form 990 or Form 990 (SF) need not be filed by:
(i) A fraternal beneficiary society, order, or association, described in section 501(c)(8), or
(ii) An organization described in section 501(c)(1) if it is a corporation wholly owned by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or is a wholly owned subsidiary of such a corporation,
which has established its exemption from tax under section 501(a).
(3) The provisions of section 6033(a) relieving certain specified types of organizations exempt from tax under section 501(a) from filing annual returns do not abridge or impair in any way the powers and authority of district directors or directors of service centers provided for in other provisions of the Code and in the regulations thereunder to require the filing of such returns by such organizations. See section 6001 and § 1.6001-1.
(h)
Records, statements, and other returns of tax-exempt organizations.
(1) An organization which has established its right to exemption from tax under section 501(a) and has also established that it is not required to file annually the return of information on Form 990, 990-A, 990 (SF), or 990-A (SF) shall immediately notify in writing the district director for the internal revenue district in which its principal office is located of any changes in its character, operations, or purpose for which it was originally created.
(2) Every organization which has established its right to exemption from tax, whether or not it is required to file an annual return of information, shall submit such additional information as may be required by the district director for the purpose of enabling him to inquire further into its exempt status and to administer the provisions of subchapter F (section 501 and following), chapter 1 of the Code, and of section 6033. See section 6001 and § 1.6001-1 with respect to the authority of the district director or directors of service centers to require such additional information and with respect to the permanent books of account or records to be kept by such organizations.
(3) An organization which has established its right to exemption from tax under section 501(a), including an organization which is relieved under section 6033 and this section from filing annual returns of information, is not, however, relieved from the duty of filing other returns of information. See, for example, sections 6041 and 6051 and the regulations thereunder.
(i)
Unrelated business tax returns.
In addition to the foregoing requirements of this section, certain organizations otherwise exempt from tax under section 501(a) and described in section 501(c) (2), (3), (5), (6), or (17) or section 401(a) which are subject to tax on unrelated business taxable income are also required to file returns on Form 990-T. See paragraph (e) of § 1.6012-2 and paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.6012-3 for requirements with respect to such returns.

(ii) Subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the information generally required to be furnished by an organization exempt under section 501(a) is:
(A) Its gross income for the year. For this purpose, gross income includes tax-exempt income, but does not include contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts received. Whether an item constitutes a contribution, gift, grant, or similar amount depends upon all the surrounding facts and circumstances. The computation of gross income shall be made by subtracting the cost of goods sold from all receipts other than gross contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts received and nonincludible dues and assessments from members and affiliates.
(B) To the extent not included in gross income, its dues and assessments from members and affiliates for the year.
(C) Its expenses incurred within the year attributable to gross income.

In the case of a private foundation (as defined in section 509(a)), the names and addresses of all persons who became substantial contributors (as defined in section 507(d)(2)) during the taxable year shall be furnished. In addition, for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, each private foundation shall furnish the names and addresses of all persons who became substantial contributors before such taxable year. For special rules with respect to contributors and donors, see paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.

managers, within the meaning of section 4946(b)(1). Organizations must also attach a schedule showing the names and addresses and/or total numbers of key employees, highly compensated employees, and independent contractors as prescribed by publication, form, or instructions.
(H) A schedule showing the compensation and other payments made to each person whose name is required to be listed pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(G) of this section during the calendar year ending within the organization's annual accounting period, or during such other period as prescribed by publication, form, or instructions.
(I) For any taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1971, such information as is required by Forms 4848 and 4849 and, only with respect to any such taxable year ending before December 31, 1972, such information as is required by Form 2950. Such forms are required by this section to be filed by an organization exempt from tax under section 501(a) which is an employer who maintains a funded pension or annuity plan for its employees. See paragraph (g) of this section for exceptions from filing. Form 4849 need not be filed by the organization if the fiduciary for the plan has given written notification to the organization that such form will be filed as an attachment to Form 990-P filed by the fiduciary. Form 4848 (and Form 4849 if required to be filed by the organization) shall be filed as a separate return on or before the due date for Form 990. For rules relating to the extension of time for filing, see section 6081 and the regulations thereunder and the instructions for Form 4848. A central organization which files Form 990 as a group return under paragraph (d) of this section may also file Form 4848 as a group return. The rules provided by paragraph (d) of this section with respect to a group return filed on Form 990 shall apply to a group return filed on Form 4848. Unless otherwise expressly provided therein, an authorization to include a local organization in a group for purposes of filing Form 990 as a group return shall be treated as an authorization to include such local organization in a group for purposes of filing Form 4848 as a group return. A group return on Form 4848 shall be filed in accordance with this section and the instructions to Form 4848 and shall be considered the return of each local organization included therein. In addition to the information required to be furnished by Forms 4848 and 4849, the district director may require any further information that he considers necessary to determine qualification of the plan under section 401 or the taxability under section 403(b) of a beneficiary under an annuity purchased by a section 501(c)(3) organization.

(M) Its lobbying expenditures, grass roots expenditures, exempt purpose expenditures, lobbying nontaxable amount, and grass roots nontaxable amount for the taxable year and for prior taxable years that are base years (within the meaning of § 1.501(h)-3(c)(7)), if the organization has an election under section 501(h) in effect for the taxable year. An organization that is a member of an affiliated group of organizations (as defined in § 56.4911-7(e)) but that is not a member of a limited affiliated group (as defined in § 56.4911-10(b)) shall report this information based on the expenditures of all members of the group during the taxable year of the group that ends with or within the member's taxable year and for prior taxable years of the group that are base years (within the meaning of § 56.4911-9(b)). For additional information required to be furnished by members of an affiliated group of organizations, and by controlling members in a limited affiliated group, see §§ 56.4911-9(d) and 56.4911-10(f)(1), respectively.

(iii)
Special rules.
In providing the names and addresses of contributors and donors under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(F) of this section:
(A) An organization described in section 501(c)(3) which meets the 33
1/3
percent-of-support test of the regulations under section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) (without regard to whether such organization otherwise qualifies as an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)) is required to provide the name and address of a person who contributed, bequeathed, or devised $5,000 or more during the year only if his amount is in excess of 2 percent of the total contributions, bequests and devises received by the organization during the year.
(B) An organization other than a private foundation is required to report only the names and addresses of contributors of whom it has actual knowledge. For instance, an organization need not require an employer who withholds contributions from the compensation of employees and pays over to the organization periodically the total amounts withheld, to specify the amounts paid over with respect to a particular employee. In such case, unless the organization has actual knowledge that a particular employee gave more than $5,000 (and in excess of 2 percent if paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is applicable), the organization need report only the name and address of the employer, and the total amount paid over by the employer.
(C) Separate and independent gifts made by one person in a particular year need be aggregated to determine whether his contributions and bequests exceed $5,000 (and are in excess of 2 percent if paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is applicable), only if such gifts are of $1,000 or more.
(D)(
1
) Organizations described in section 501(c)(7), (8), or (10) that receive contributions or bequests to be used exclusively for purposes described in section 170(c)(4), 2055(a)(3), or 2522(a)(3), must attach a schedule with respect to all gifts that aggregate more than
$1,000 from any one person showing the total amount of the contributions or bequests from each such person, the specific purpose or purposes for which such amount was received, and the specific use or uses to which such amount was put.In the case of an amount set aside for such purposes, the organization shall indicate the manner in which such amount is held (for instance, whether such amount is commingled with amounts held for other purposes). If the contribution or bequest was transferred to another organization, the schedule must include the name of the transferee organization, a description of the nature of such organization, and a description of the relationship between the transferee and transferor organizations.
(
2
) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, such organizations must also attach a statement showing the total dollar amount of contributions and bequests received for such purposes which are $1,000 or less.
(iv)
Listing of States.
A private foundation is required to attach to its return required by this section a list of all States:
(A) To which the organization reports in any fashion concerning its organization, assets, or activities, or
(B) With which the organization has registered (or which it has otherwise notified in any manner) that it intends to be, or is, a charitable organization or a holder of property devoted to a charitable purpose.
(3)(i) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and ending before December 31, 1971, every employee's trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) shall file an annual return on Form 990-P. The return shall include the information required by paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of § 1.401-1. For such years, in addition, the trust must file the information required to be filed by the employer pursuant to the provisions of § 1.404(a)-2, unless the employer has notified the trustee in writing that he has filed or will timely file such information. If the trustee has received such notification from the employer, then such notification, or a copy thereof, shall be retained by the trust as a part of its records.
(ii) For taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1971, and before December 31, 1975, every employee's trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) shall file an annual return on Form 990-P. The trust shall furnish such information as is required by such form and the instructions issued with respect thereto.
(4) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980, trusts described in section 4947(a)(1) and nonexempt private foundations shall comply with the requirements of section 6033 and this section in the same manner as organizations described in section 501(c)(3) which are exempt from tax under section 501(a). This section shall be applied for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980 as if trusts described in section 4947(a)(1) and nonexempt private foundations were described in section 501(c)(3). Therefore, for purposes of this section, all references to exempt organizations shall include section 4947(a)(1) trusts and nonexempt private foundations and all references to private foundations shall include section 4947(a)(1) trusts that would be private foundations if they were described in section 501(c)(3) and all nonexempt private foundations. Similarly, for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(d), the purposes for which a section 4947(a)(1) trust or a nonexempt private foundation is organized shall be treated as the purposes for which it is exempt. Similarly, for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, the purposes for which a section 4947(a)(1) trust or a nonexempt private foundation is organized shall be treated as the purposes for which it is exempt. See section 509(b) and § 1.509(b)-1. See also section 642(c)(6) and § 1.642(c)-4.
(5) Political organizations, as defined by section 527(e)(1), that have gross receipts of $25,000 or more for the taxable year (or in the case of a qualified State or local political organization, as defined in section 527(e)(5), that has gross receipts of $100,000 or more for the taxable year) generally must comply with the requirements of section 6033 and this section in the same manner as organizations exempt from tax under section 501(a), except to the extent that
the Commissioner may modify such requirements through forms, instructions to forms, or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin as appropriate for carrying out the purposes of section 527. For the purposes of this section, all references to organizations exempt from tax under section 501(a) shall include political organizations referred to in section 6033(g), other than those referred to in section 6033(g)(3) and except to the extent the Commissioner exercises discretion under section 6033(g)(4). This discretion may be exercised through forms, instructions to forms, or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. In addition to the reporting requirements applicable to organizations exempt under section 501(a), such political organizations generally must report the names and addresses of all persons that contributed, bequeathed, or devised $5,000 or more (in money or other property) during the taxable year.
(6) Each controlling organization (within the meaning of section 512(b)(13)) that is subject to the requirements of section 6033(a) shall include on its annual return such information required by that return regarding—
(i) Any interest, annuities, royalties, or rents received from each controlled entity (within the meaning of section 512(b)(13));
(ii) Any loans made to each such controlled entity; and
(iii) Any transfers of funds between such controlling organization and each such controlled entity.
(7) Every organization described in section 4966(d)(1) shall, on its annual return for the taxable year—
(i) List the total number of donor advised funds (as defined in section 4966(d)(2)) it owns at the end of such taxable year;
(ii) Report the aggregate value of assets held in such funds at the end of such taxable year; and
(iii) Report the aggregate contributions to and grants made from such funds during such taxable year.
(8) Every organization described in section 509(a)(3) shall, on its annual return—
(i) List the supported organizations (as defined in section 509(f)(3)) with respect to which such organization provides support;
(ii) Specify whether the organization meets the requirements of clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of section 509(a)(3)(B); and
(iii) Certify that the organization meets the requirements of section 509(a)(3)(C).
(b)
Accounting period for filing return.
A return required by this section shall be on the basis of the established annual accounting period of the organization. If the organization has no such established accounting period, such return shall be on the basis of the calendar year.
(c)
Returns when exempt status not established.
An organization claiming an exempt status under section 501(a) prior to the establishment of such exempt status under section 501 and § 1.501(a)-1, shall file a return required by this section in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto. In such case the organization must indicate on such return that it is being filed in the belief that the organization is exempt under section 501(a), but that the Internal Revenue Service has not yet recognized such exemption.
(d)
Group returns.
(1) A central, parent, or like organization (referred to in this paragraph as “central organization”), exempt under section 501(a) and described in section 501(c) (other than a private foundation), although required to file a separate annual return for itself under section 6033 and paragraph (a) of this section, may file annually, in addition to such separate annual return, a group return on Form 990. Such group return may be filed for two or more of the local organizations, chapters, or the like (referred to in this paragraph as “local organizations”) which are (i) affiliated with such central organization at the close of its annual accounting period, (ii) subject to the general supervision or control of the central organization, and (iii) exempt from taxation under the same paragraph of section 501(c) of the Code, although the local organizations are not necessarily exempt under the paragraph under which the central organization is exempt. Such group return may not be filed for a local organization which is a private foundation.
(2)(i) The filing of the group return shall be in lieu of the filing of a separate return by each of the local organizations included in the group return. The group return shall include only those local organizations which in writing have authorized the central organization to include them in the group return, and which have made and filed, with the central organization, their statements, specifically stating their items of gross income, receipts, and disbursements, and such other information relating to them as is required to be stated in the group return. Such an authorization and statement by a local organization shall be made under the penalties of perjury, shall be signed by a duly authorized officer of the local organization in his official capacity, and shall contain the following statement, or a statement of like import: “I hereby declare under the penalties of perjury that this authorization (including any accompanying schedules and statements) has been examined by me and to the best of my knowledge and belief is true, correct and complete and made in good faith.” Such authorization and statement with respect to a local organization shall be retained by the central organization until the expiration of 6 years after the last taxable year for which a group return filed by such central organization includes such local organization.
(ii) There shall be attached to the group return and made a part thereof a schedule showing the name, address, and employer identification number of each of the local organizations and the total number thereof included in such return, and a schedule showing the name, address, and employer identification number of each of the local organizations and the total number thereof not included in the group return.
(3) The group return shall be on the basis of the established annual accounting period of the central organization. Where such central organization has no established annual accounting period, such return shall be on the basis of the calendar year. The same income, receipts, and disbursements of a local organization shall not be included in more than one group return.
(4) The group return shall be filed in accordance with these regulations and the instructions issued with respect to Form 990, and shall be considered the return of each local organization included therein. The tax exempt status of a local organization must be established under a group exemption letter issued to the central organization before a group return including the local organization will be considered as the return of the local organization. See § 1.501(a)-1 for requirements for establishing a tax-exempt status.
(5) In providing the information required by paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(F), (G), and (H) of this section, such information may be provided:
(i) With respect to the central or parent organization on its Form 990, and with respect to the local organizations on separate schedules attached to the group return for the year, or
(ii) On a consolidated basis for all the local organizations and the central or parent organization on the group return.
Such information need be provided only with respect to those local organizations which are not excepted from filing under the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section. A central or parent organization shall indicate whether it has provided such information in the manner described in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section, and may not change the manner in which it provides such information without the consent of the Commissioner.
(e)
Time and place for filing.
The annual return required by this section shall be filed on or before the 15th day of the fifth month following the close of the period for which the return is required to be filed. The annual return on Form 1065 required to be filed by a religious or apostolic association or corporation shall be filed on or before the date prescribed by section 6072(b). Each such return shall be filed in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto.
(f)
Penalties and additions to tax.
For penalties and additions to tax for failure to file a return and filing a false or fraudulent return, see sections 6652, 7203, 7206, and 7207.
(g)
Organizations not required to file annual returns.
(1) Annual returns required by this section are not required to be filed by an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) which is:

(viii) A foreign organization (described in paragraph (k)(1) of this section) or a United States possession organization (described in paragraph (k)(2) of this section) (other than a private foundation or a supporting organization described in section 509(a)(3))—

(B) That has no significant activity (including lobbying and political activity and the operation of a trade or business, but excluding investment activity) in the United States.
(2) The provisions of section 6033(a) relieving certain specified types of organizations exempt from taxation under section 501(a) from filing annual returns do not abridge or impair in any way the powers and authority of district directors or directors of service centers provided for in other provisions of the Code and in regulations thereunder to require the filing of returns or notices by such organizations. See section 6001 and § 1.6001-1.
(3) For purposes of paragraphs (g)(1)(iii) and (viii) of this section, the gross receipts (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) of an organization are normally not more than $50,000 if:
(i) In the case of an organization that has been in existence for 1 year or less, the organization has received, or donors have pledged to give, gross receipts of $75,000 or less during the first taxable year of the organization;
(ii) In the case of an organization that has been in existence for more than one but less than 3 years, the average of the gross receipts received by the organization in its first 2 taxable years is $60,000 or less; and
(iii) In the case of an organization that has been in existence for 3 years or more, the average of the gross receipts received by the organization in the immediately preceding 3 taxable years, including the year for which the return would be required to be filed, is $50,000 or less.
(4) For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (a)(2) of this section, “gross receipts” means the gross amount received by the organization during its annual accounting period from all sources without reduction for any costs or expenses including, for example, cost of goods or assets sold, cost of operations, or expenses of earning, raising, or collecting such amounts. Thus “gross receipts” includes, but is not limited to (i) the gross amount received as contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts without reduction for the expenses of raising and collecting such amounts, (ii) the gross
amount received as dues or assessments from members or affiliated organizations without reduction for expenses attributable to the receipt of such amounts, (iii) gross sales or receipts from business activities (including business activities unrelated to the purpose for which the organization qualifies for exemption, the net income or loss from which may be required to be reported on Form 990-T), (iv) the gross amount received from the sale of assets without reduction for cost or other basis and expenses of sale, and (v) the gross amount received as investment income, such as interest, dividends, rents, and royalties.
(5) An organization that is not required to file an annual return by virtue of paragraphs (g)(1)(iii) and (viii) of this section must submit an annual electronic notification as described in section 6033(i). See § 1.6033-6.
(6) The Commissioner may relieve any organization or class of organizations (other than an organization described in section 509(a)(3)) from filing, in whole or in part the annual return required by this section where he determines that such returns are not necessary for the efficient administration of the internal revenue laws. This discretion may be exercised through forms, instructions to forms, or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(h)
Integrated auxiliary
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this title, the
term integrated auxiliary of a church
means an organization that is—
(i) Described both in sections 501(c)(3) and 509(a) (1), (2), or (3);
(ii) Affiliated with a church or a convention or association of churches; and
(iii) Internally supported.
(2)
Affiliation.
An organization is affiliated with a church or a convention or association of churches, for purposes of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, if—
(i) The organization is covered by a group exemption letter issued under applicable administrative procedures, (such as Rev. Proc. 80-27 (1980-1 C.B. 677); See § 601.601(a)(2)(ii)(
b
)), to a church or a convention or association of churches;
(ii) The organization is operated, supervised, or controlled by or in connection with (as defined in § 1.509(a)-4) a church or a convention or association of churches; or
(iii) Relevant facts and circumstances show that it is so affiliated.
(3)
Facts and circumstances.
For purposes of paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, relevant facts and circumstances that indicate an organization is affiliated with a church or a convention or association of churches include the following factors. However, the absence of one or more of the following factors does not necessarily preclude classification of an organization as being affiliated with a church or a convention or association of churches—
(i) The organization's enabling instrument (corporate charter, trust instrument, articles of association, constitution or similar document) or by-laws affirm that the organization shares common religious doctrines, principles, disciplines, or practices with a church or a convention or association of churches;
(ii) A church or a convention or association of churches has the authority to appoint or remove, or to control the appointment or removal of, at least one of the organization's officers or directors;
(iii) The corporate name of the organization indicates an institutional relationship with a church or a convention or association of churches;
(iv) The organization reports at least annually on its financial and general operations to a church or a convention or association of churches;
(v) An institutional relationship between the organization and a church or a convention or association of churches is affirmed by the church, or convention or association of churches, or a designee thereof; and
(vi) In the event of dissolution, the organization's assets are required to be distributed to a church or a convention or association of churches, or to an affiliate thereof within the meaning of this paragraph (h).
(4)
Internal support.
An organization is internally supported, for purposes of paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, unless it both—
(i) Offers admissions, goods, services or facilities for sale, other than on an
incidental basis, to the general public (except goods, services, or facilities sold at a nominal charge or for an insubstantial portion of the cost); and
(ii) Normally receives more than 50 percent of its support from a combination of governmental sources, public solicitation of contributions, and receipts from the sale of admissions, goods, performance of services, or furnishing of facilities in activities that are not unrelated trades or businesses.
(5)
Special rule.
Men's and women's organizations, seminaries, mission societies, and youth groups that satisfy paragraphs (h)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section are integrated auxiliaries of a church regardless of whether such an organization meets the internal support requirement under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section.
(6)
Effective date.
This paragraph (h) applies for returns filed for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969. For returns filed for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969 but beginning before December 20, 1995, the definition for the term
integrated auxiliary of a church
set forth in § 1.6033-2(g)(5) (as contained in the 26 CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1995) may be used as an alternative definition to such term set forth in this paragraph (h).
(7)
Examples of internal support.
The internal support test of this paragraph (h) is illustrated by the following examples, in each of which it is assumed that the organization's provision of goods and services does not constitute an unrelated trade or business:

# Example 1.
Organization A is described in sections 501(c)(3) and 509(a)(2) and is affiliated (within the meaning of this paragraph (h)) with a church. Organization A publishes a weekly newspaper as its only activity. On an incidental basis, some copies of Organization A's publication are sold to nonmembers of the church with which it is affiliated. Organization A advertises for subscriptions at places of worship of the church. Organization A is internally supported, regardless of its sources of financial support, because it does not offer admissions, goods, services, or facilities for sale, other than on an incidental basis, to the general public. Organization A is an integrated auxiliary.

# Example 2.
Organization B is a retirement home described in sections 501(c)(3) and 509(a)(2). Organization B is affiliated (within the meaning of this paragraph (h)) with a church. Admission to Organization B is open to all members of the community for a fee. Organization B advertises in publications of general distribution appealing to the elderly and maintains its name on non-denominational listings of available retirement homes. Therefore, Organization B offers its services for sale to the general public on more than an incidental basis. Organization B receives a cash contribution of $50,000 annually from the church. Fees received by Organization B from its residents total $100,000 annually. Organization B does not receive any government support or contributions from the general public. Total support is $150,000 ($100,000 + $50,000), and $100,000 of that total is from receipts from the performance of services (66
2/3
% of total support). Therefore, Organization B receives more than 50 percent of its support from receipts from the performance of services. Organization B is not internally supported and is not an integrated auxiliary.

# Example 3.
Organization C is a hospital that is described in sections 501(c)(3) and 509(a)(1). Organization C is affiliated (within the meaning of this paragraph (h)) with a church. Organization C is open to all persons in need of hospital care in the community, although most of Organization C's patients are members of the same denomination as the church with which Organization C is affiliated. Organization C maintains its name on hospital listings used by the general public, and participating doctors are allowed to admit all patients. Therefore, Organization C offers its services for sale to the general public on more than an incidental basis. Organization C annually receives $250,000 in support from the church, $1,000,000 in payments from patients and third party payors (including Medicare, Medicaid and other insurers) for patient care, $100,000 in contributions from the public, $100,000 in grants from the federal government (other than Medicare and Medicaid payments) and $50,000 in investment income. Total support is $1,500,000 ($250,000 + $1,000,000 + $100,000 + $100,000 + $50,000), and $1,200,000 ($1,000,000 + $100,000 + $100,000) of that total is support from receipts from the performance of services, government sources, and public contributions (80% of total support). Therefore, Organization C receives more than 50 percent of its support from receipts from the performance of services, government sources, and public contributions. Organization C is not internally supported and is not an integrated auxiliary.

Records, statements, and other returns of tax-exempt organizations.

Organizations Determinations, at an address prescribed by publication (including publication on the Internal Revenue Service Web site), of any changes in its character, operations, or purpose for which it was originally created.
(2) Every organization which is exempt from tax, whether or not it is required to file an annual information return, shall submit such additional information as may be required by the Internal Revenue Service for the purpose of inquiring into its exempt status and administering the provisions of subchapter F (section 501 and following), chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code, section 6033, and chapter 42 of subtitle D of the Code.

§ 1.6033-6
Notification requirement for entities not required to file an annual information return under section 6033(a)(1) (taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006).
(a)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, every organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) that is not required to file a return described in § 1.6033-2(a)(2), other than an organization described in section 401(a) or 501(d), shall submit annually, in electronic form, a notification setting forth the items described in paragraph (c) of this section and
such other information as may be prescribed in the instructions and publications issued with respect to the notification.
(b)
Organizations not required to submit annual electronic notification.
(1) An organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) that is required to file or files an annual information return under section 6033(a)(1) shall not submit an annual electronic notification under section 6033(i). This includes the following types of organizations:
(i) Any organization included in a group return for that year under § 1.6033-2(d).
(ii) All private foundations required to file under § 1.6033-2(a)(2)(i) Form 990-PF, “Return of Private Foundation or Section 4947(a)(1) Nonexempt Charitable Trust Treated as a Private Foundation.”
(iii) Section 509(a)(3) supporting organizations required to file under § 1.6033-2(a)(2)(i) Form 990, “Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax,” or Form 990-EZ, “Short Form Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax.”
(iv) A section 501(c)(21) black lung trust required to file under § 1.6033-2(a)(2)(i) Form 990-BL, “Information and Initial Excise Tax Return for Black Lung Benefit Trusts and Certain Related Persons.”
(v) Any organization that is required to file or files an annual information return under section 6033(a)(1) on any other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for that purpose.
(2) An organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) that is not required to file a return under section 6033(a)(1) is also not required to submit an annual electronic notification under section 6033(i). This includes the following types of organizations:
(i) A church, an interchurch organization of local units of a church, a convention or association of churches, or an integrated auxiliary of a church (as defined in § 1.6033-2(h)).
(ii) An exclusively religious activity of any religious order.
(iii) A mission society sponsored by or affiliated with one or more churches or church denominations, more than one-half of the activities of which society are conducted in, or directed at persons in, foreign countries.
(iv) An educational organization (below college level) described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii), that has a program of a general academic nature, and that is affiliated (within the meaning of § 1.6033-2(h)(2)) with a church or operated by a religious order.
(v) A State institution, the income of which is excluded from gross income under section 115(a).
(vi) An organization described in section 501(c)(1).
(vii) An organization that is a governmental unit or an affiliate of a governmental unit exempt from Federal income tax under section 501(a).
(3) If an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) is not described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, the organization must submit an annual electronic notification. Thus, a black lung trust that normally has gross receipts of $25,000 or less is not required to file Form 990-BL but is required to submit an annual electronic notification. A section 509(a)(3) supporting organization of a religious organization that normally has gross receipts of $5,000 or less is not required to file Form 990 or Form 990-EZ but is required to submit an annual electronic notification.
(c)
Additional notification requirements
—(1)
In general.
Any organization described in paragraph (a) of this section shall submit an annual electronic notification described in section 6033(i)(1). The annual electronic notification shall—
(i) Be in electronic form; and
(ii) Set forth—
(A) The legal name of the organization;
(B) Any name under which the organization operates or does business;
(C) The organization's mailing address and Internet Web site address (if any);
(D) The organization's taxpayer identification number;
(E) The name and address of a principal officer;
(F) Evidence of the continuing basis for the organization's exemption from the filing requirements under section 6033(a)(1); and
(G) Additional information necessary to process the notification.
(2) The mailing address required by section 6033(i)(1)(C) and submitted in the annual electronic notification shall be the organization's last known address as provided by § 301.6212-2(a) of this chapter. This last known address may be updated as provided under § 301.6212-2 of this chapter, or by clear and concise notification. The Internal Revenue Service will use this last known address as the organization's address of record and will direct all mailings to this address.
(3) By submitting the annual electronic notification described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an organization acknowledges that it is not required to file a return under section 6033(a) because its annual gross receipts are not normally in excess of $25,000. In order to make this determination, the organization must keep records that enable it to calculate its gross receipts. All organizations are required to maintain records under section 6001. These records will provide evidence of the continuing basis for the organization's exemption from the filing requirements under section 6033(a)(1).
(4) If an organization that is required to submit an annual electronic notification files a complete Form 990 or Form 990-EZ, the annual electronic notification requirement shall be deemed satisfied. The annual electronic notification requirement is not satisfied if the Form 990 or Form 990-EZ contains only those items of information that would have been required by submitting the notification in electronic form. Also, the filing of a complete Form 990 or Form 990-EZ, rather than the submission of an annual electronic notification, is the filing of a return that starts the period of limitations for assessment under section 6501(g)(2).
(d)
No effect on other filing requirements.
An organization that is relieved from filing an information return under section 6033(a) is still subject to the requirements of §§ 1.6033-2(i) and (j), concerning: notice regarding changes in character, operations, or purpose; provision of additional information; duty to file other returns of information; and duty to file unrelated business tax returns. If an organization is required to file an unrelated business tax return, Form 990-T, “Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return,” the filing of that return does not relieve the organization from the requirement of submitting an annual electronic notification under section 6033(i).
(e)
Accounting period for submitting annual electronic notification.
An annual electronic notification required by this section shall be on the basis of the established annual accounting period of the organization. If the organization has no established accounting period, the annual electronic notification shall be on the basis of the calendar year.
(f)
Time and place for submitting annual electronic notification.
The annual electronic notification required by this section shall be submitted on or before the 15th day of the fifth calendar month following the close of the period for which the notification is required to be submitted. Thus, an organization with an accounting period ending December 31, 2007, is required to submit an annual electronic notification by May 15, 2008. The notification shall be submitted in accordance with instructions and publications, including those provided at the Internal Revenue Service Web site for exempt organizations.
(g)
Effective/applicability date.
These regulations are applicable to annual periods beginning after 2006.

(2) The amount paid out during the taxable year which represents amounts permanently set aside in prior years for which charitable or other deductions have been taken under section 642(c), and separately listing for each class of activity, for which disbursements were made, the total amount paid out;
(3) The amount for which charitable or other deductions have been taken in prior years under section 642(c) and which had not been paid out at the beginning of the taxable year;
(4)(i) The amount paid out of principal in the taxable year for charitable, etc., purposes, and separately listing for each such class of activity, for which disbursements were made, the total amount paid out;

(2)
Trusts described in section 4947(a)(1).
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980, a trust described in section 4947(a)(1) is not required to file a Form 1041-A.

§ 1.6035-1
Basis information to persons acquiring property from decedent.
(a)
Overview.
This section implements the reporting requirements under section 6035 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) applicable to executors and certain trustees. In general, the reporting requirements of this section require providing information to the IRS on the identity of persons acquiring property from a decedent and providing basis information to persons acquiring that property from the decedent. Basis information is needed by certain persons acquiring property from a decedent in order to comply with the consistent basis requirement of section 1014(f) of the Code.
See
§ 1.1014-10 for rules applicable to the consistent basis requirement.
(b)
Applicability of section 6035 reporting requirements
—(1)
In general.
The reporting requirements under section 6035 of the Code apply only in the case of an estate in which the executor is required to file an estate tax return under section 6018 of the Code (determined without regard to § 20.2010-2(a)(1) of this chapter) (
required estate tax return
) and the executor files that return after July 31, 2015. The requirements do not apply in the case of an estate whose required estate tax return is filed on or before July 31, 2015, even if the due date of the return is after July 31, 2015, or if one or more supplements to that return are filed with the IRS after July 31, 2015. Whether an estate tax return is a required estate tax return depends on the relevant factors identified in section 6018 and the corresponding regulations, including the date of death value of property includible in the decedent's gross estate, the amount of adjusted taxable gifts, and the applicable filing threshold. An election under section 2032 or 2032A of the Code to determine the value of the gross estate in accordance with those respective provisions is not relevant to whether an executor is required to file an estate tax return under section 6018. If an estate tax return is not required to be filed under section 6018 based on the relevant factors identified in section 6018, then an estate tax return filed for another purpose (such as to make a portability election under section 2010(c)(5) of the Code, an allocation or election under section 2632 of the Code with regard to a decedent's generation-skipping transfer tax exemption, or a protective filing to avoid a penalty or satisfy a State law requirement) is not a required estate tax return for purposes of this section.
(2)
Executor(s) subject to section 6035 reporting requirements.
For purposes of this section, the term
executor
has the same meaning as in section 2203 of the Code, as expanded to include all persons required under section 6018(b) to file an estate tax return. Thus, more than one person may be subject to the reporting requirements for the same decedent's estate. If one executor is unable to file a complete estate tax return (for example, if the executor has insufficient information about property in the decedent's gross estate that is not in the possession of that executor), each person required to file a return is subject to the reporting requirements of this section only with
regard to the property reported (or required to be reported) on the estate tax return required to be filed by that person. Similarly, if no executor is appointed by a court, each person in actual or constructive possession of any property of the decedent is an executor for purposes of this section and is subject to the reporting requirements of this section, but only with regard to the property reported or required to be reported on the estate tax return required to be filed by that executor under section 6018(b).

The following examples, in which the decedent D was a United States citizen at the time of the decedent's death, illustrates the application of this paragraph (b).
(i)
Example 1
—
Executor required to file a return under section 6018.
The value at death of property includible in D's gross estate exceeds the basic exclusion amount in effect for the year of D's death under section 2010(c). On the timely-filed estate tax return, D's executor makes a valid alternate valuation election under section 2032 to value the property of D's gross estate as of a date subsequent to the date of death. As a result, the value of property includible in D's gross estate is decreased to a value that is less than the basic exclusion amount in effect for the year of D's death. Because D's executor is required to file an estate tax return under section 6018, D's executor also is subject to the reporting requirements of section 6035. This is true even though no estate tax liability was incurred, and the requirements of section 1014(f) do not apply to any property includible in D's gross estate.
See
§ 1.1014-10(c)(1).
(ii)
Example 2
—
Executor not required to file a return under section 6018.
The value at death of property includible in D's gross estate does not exceed the basic exclusion amount in effect for the year of D's death under section 2010(c) of the Code. In accordance with the terms of D's will, D's executor distributes D's entire estate to D's only child. D's executor files an estate tax return solely for the purpose of making a portability election under section 2010(c)(5). Because D's executor is not required to file an estate tax return under section 6018, D's executor is not subject to the reporting requirements of section 6035.
(iii)
Example 3
—
No executor appointed.
The value at death of property includible in D's gross estate exceeds the basic exclusion amount in effect for the year of D's death under section 2010(c) and consists entirely of D's interests in Property A and Property B that D owned with Nephew A and Nephew B, respectively, as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. Pursuant to local law, Nephew A becomes the sole owner of Property A and Nephew B becomes the sole owner of Property B upon D's death. No executor or administrator is appointed, qualified, or acting within the United States for D's estate on the due date of D's estate tax return. Because Nephew A has actual or constructive possession of Property A, Nephew A is an executor described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section with regard to D's interest in Property A. Because Nephew A is required to file an estate tax return under section 6018 with regard to D's interest in Property A, Nephew A also is subject to the reporting requirements of section 6035 with respect to Property A. Similarly, because Nephew B has actual or constructive possession of Property B on the due date of D's estate tax return, Nephew B is an executor described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section with regard to D's interest in Property B. Because Nephew B is required to file an estate tax return under section 6018 with regard to D's interest in Property B, Nephew B also is subject to the reporting requirements of section 6035 with respect to Property B.
(iv)
Example 4
—
Executor unable to make a complete return.
The value at death of property includible in D's gross estate exceeds the basic exclusion amount in effect for the year of D's death under section 2010(c). E is appointed the executor of D's estate. During the administration of D's estate, E discovers that D has made transfers each year for the past ten years to T as trustee of Trust. E contacts T, but T refuses to provide E with any information regarding Trust. E timely files D's estate tax return reporting the value of all of the property in D's gross estate except Trust. Pursuant to § 20.6018-2 of
this chapter, E includes with the return a statement that gives T's name and contact information and the date and amount of each transfer from D to T as trustee of Trust, which is all the information E has about Trust. The IRS provides notice to T of T's obligation to make D's estate return as to Trust. Because E is required to file an estate tax return under section 6018, E is subject to the reporting requirements of section 6035 as to the property reported on the estate tax return filed by E. Because T is required to file an estate tax return under section 6018, T is subject to the reporting requirements of section 6035 as to Trust.
(c)
Required Information Return and Statement
(
s
)—(1)
Required Information Return.
An executor required to file an estate tax return under section 6018 must file with the IRS an Information Return by the date required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The term
Information Return
refers to the Form 8971,
Information Regarding Beneficiaries Acquiring Property from a Decedent,
and all required attachments. Required attachments include a copy of each Statement described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section (if any) required to be furnished to a beneficiary who acquires property within the meaning of paragraph (c)(4) of this section on or before the due date of the estate tax return or, if earlier, the date on which the estate tax return is filed with the IRS. Required attachments also include a copy of each Statement (if any) furnished pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section before the filing of the Information Return. The term
Information Return
also refers to any successor form or procedure designated by the IRS for this purpose. The Information Return must identify each beneficiary who has acquired or will acquire property subject to reporting (under paragraph (e) of this section), as well as other information prescribed by the Information Return and the instructions for that form. For the duty to supplement the Information Return in the event such property is acquired by a beneficiary after the filing of the estate tax return, see paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. For the duty to supplement the Information Return in the event of a change to the information required to be reported, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Required Statement
(
s
). An executor required to file an estate tax return under section 6018 also must furnish a Statement to each beneficiary who acquires property subject to reporting under paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of this section, the term
Statement
refers to the payee statement described as Schedule A of the Information Return to be furnished to a beneficiary, or any successor form, schedule, or procedure designated by the IRS for this purpose. The Statement furnished to a beneficiary must identify that beneficiary's acquired property and its value and other information prescribed by the Statement and the instructions for that form. For each property reported on a Statement, the value the executor reports on that Statement is the value of the property as reported on the estate tax return filed with the IRS. Generally, this is the value of the property on the date of the decedent's death, except in the case of an election in which the value is determined under section 2032 or 2032A, in which case it is the value determined under the applicable provision. If different interests in the same property pass from the decedent to one or more income beneficiaries or life tenants and remaindermen, the value to be reported is the value of the entire property and each recipient will be responsible for identifying his or her respective share of uniform basis. For the duty to supplement the Statement in the event of a change to the information required to be reported, including a change in the identified value of property reported on a Statement, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(3)
Due dates
—(i)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section and in § 1.6035-2, the executor must file the Information Return with the IRS on or before the due date specified in this paragraph (c)(3)(i). In addition, each Statement, a copy of which is required to be attached to the Information Return, must be furnished to the named beneficiary on or before this same due date. The Information Return must be filed, and each such Statement (if any) must
be furnished to its named beneficiary, on or before the earlier of—
(A) The date that is 30 days after the due date of the estate tax return required under section 6018 (including extensions, if any); or
(B) The date that is 30 days after the date on which that estate tax return is filed with the IRS.
(ii)
Due date and applicable rules if property is acquired subsequently by beneficiary.
If a beneficiary acquires property subject to reporting after the due date of the estate tax return (or the earlier filing of the Information Return), the executor must furnish a Statement to that beneficiary with regard to that acquired property on or before January 31 of the year following the beneficiary's acquisition of that property. By that same January 31, the executor also must attach a copy of the Statement to a supplement to the Information Return (a supplemental Information Return) and must file the supplemental Information Return with the IRS. The supplemental Information Return must include a copy of each Statement required to be furnished for that year pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), as well as a copy of each Statement (if any) furnished in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this section that has not already been filed with the IRS as an attachment to the Information Return or a supplement to the Information Return. The requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) do not apply if the property already has been reported on a Statement furnished pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section. See this paragraph (c)(3) and paragraph (d)(4) of this section for the due date of other required supplements to this reporting.
(iii)
Transition rule.
If the due date of an estate tax return required to be filed by section 6018 is on or before July 31, 2015, but the executor does not file the estate tax return with the IRS until after July 31, 2015, then the Information Return and all required Statements are due on or before the date that is 30 days after the date on which the estate tax return is filed, except as provided in § 1.6035-2.
(4)
Acquiring an interest in property.
For purposes of this section, the term
acquired property
refers to property subject to reporting under paragraph (e) of this section that a beneficiary acquires. A beneficiary acquires such property when, under local law, title vests in the beneficiary or when the beneficiary otherwise has sufficient control over or connection with the property that the beneficiary is able to take action related to the property for which basis is relevant for Federal income tax purposes (such as, for example, to sell or depreciate the property). In many cases, a beneficiary's acquisition of property occurs upon an executor's or trustee's distribution of the property. For property passing by contract or by operation of law, the beneficiary's acquisition of that property generally occurs automatically upon the death of the decedent.
(5)
Option to furnish Statement(s) prior to the acquisition of property by a beneficiary.
An executor may satisfy the requirement in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to furnish a Statement to a beneficiary by furnishing the Statement to the beneficiary prior to the beneficiary's acquisition of the property subject to reporting under paragraph (e) of this section, provided that the executor has reason to believe that the beneficiary will acquire that property. The Statement furnished to such a beneficiary must identify the property the beneficiary is expected to acquire as well as the value of that property and other information prescribed by the Statement and the instructions for that form (and must include information relating to other property actually acquired by such beneficiary as may be required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section). If, after satisfying the requirements of this paragraph (c)(5), the property is acquired by a different beneficiary, the executor must update the beneficiary information in the Information Return and furnish a Statement to that beneficiary pursuant to the duty to supplement to report a change in beneficiary information as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. The executor additionally is subject to the duty to supplement to report other changes to the information required to be reported as identified in paragraph (d) of this section.
(6)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c).
(i) The decedent D was a United States citizen at the time of D's death and the executor of D's estate E is required to file an estate tax return under section 6018. The terms of D's will provide for D's entire estate to be distributed to a marital trust. Prior to timely filing the estate tax return for D's estate, E funded the marital trust with a portion of the property, the value of which is included in D's gross estate. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the marital trust has acquired this property upon the funding of the trust by E. Under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3)(i) of this section, within 30 days of filing the estate tax return, E must file with the IRS the Information Return identifying the marital trust as the beneficiary (as well as other information prescribed by the Information Return or instructions) and must include with the Information Return all required attachments. Under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(i) of this section, by the same date, E must furnish to the marital trust the Statement identifying the portion of the property distributed to the marital trust and its estate tax value (as well as any other information prescribed by the Statement or instructions). A copy of the Statement is a required attachment to be included with the Information Return. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, E may choose to expand the property identified on the Statement to also include the property the marital trust is expected to acquire subsequently. If E so chooses, the Statement to be furnished to the marital trust will identify all such property and its value at the date of death and, except in the case of any changes to the information required to be reported, no further Statement will be required at the time of the completion of the funding of the trust.
(ii) However, if E chooses not to expand the reporting to property not yet acquired by the marital trust, then, once the marital trust has acquired additional property, E is subject to further reporting. Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, in each year that E distributes additional property to the marital trust, E must furnish, by January 31 of the following year, a Statement to the marital trust identifying all of the property the marital trust has acquired from D's estate that year and the property's estate tax value (as well as any other information prescribed by the Statement or instructions). By the same date, E must file with the IRS a supplemental Information Return and attach a copy of that Statement as well as any other required attachments.
(d)
Duty to supplement
—(1)
Duty to supplement to report changes to the information reported on the Information Return or Statement
(
s
). An executor to whom the reporting requirements of this section apply must file a supplemental Information Return with the IRS and furnish a Statement or supplemental Statement to each affected beneficiary if a change to the information required to be reported on the Information Return or Statement (or supplement to either) causes the information as reported to be incorrect or incomplete. The executor must file the supplemental Information Return with the IRS, including copies of each Statement or supplemental Statement furnished to affected beneficiaries, and must furnish a Statement or supplemental Statement to each affected beneficiary, by the due date described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(2)
Changes requiring supplement.
This paragraph (d)(2) provides a nonexhaustive list of changes that require supplemental reporting under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(i)
Change in beneficiary information.
The receipt, discovery, or acquisition by the executor of information that changes the beneficiary to whom property is to be distributed (pursuant to a death, disclaimer, bankruptcy, or otherwise), or corrects or completes other beneficiary information originally reported, will give rise to a duty to supplement.
(ii)
Change in the identified value of property.
The supplementing of an estate tax return to report a corrected estate tax value of property that was previously reported on an estate tax return and a Statement will give rise to a duty to supplement. In addition, a
final determination of value of property for Federal estate tax purposes (within the meaning of § 1.1014-10(b)(1)) that differs from the value provided on a Statement or supplement to a Statement will give rise to a duty to supplement.
(iii)
Change or addition of property subject to reporting.
The supplementing of an estate tax return to report the estate tax value of property subject to reporting under paragraph (e) of this section, if that property and/or its value previously was not reported on an estate tax return or supplement to the estate tax return, will give rise to a duty to supplement. A duty to supplement also will arise if such property or its value that previously was not reported on an estate tax return or supplement to the estate tax return is included in the decedent's gross estate pursuant to an examination by the IRS or otherwise.
(iv)
Change in property to be acquired by beneficiary.
A duty to supplement will arise if an executor furnishes a Statement to a beneficiary prior to the beneficiary's acquisition of property pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section and the beneficiary ultimately acquires property different from the property identified on that Statement. A beneficiary's acquisition of different property may occur for any reason, including an executor's receipt of different property in a transaction in which the basis of the new property received by the executor is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the final value of property acquired from or as a result of the death of the decedent (for example, as the result of a like-kind exchange under section 1031 or an involuntary conversion).
(3)
Exceptions; no duty to supplement despite certain changes.
Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2) of this section, no supplemental reporting under this section is required for:
(i) Inconsequential errors or omissions within the meaning of § 301.6722-1(b) of this chapter;
(ii) Changes resulting from an event that triggers an additional estate tax under section 2032A, including changes in value in the event of a beneficiary election under section 1016(c) of the Code;
(iii) Adjustments to the basis of property pursuant to sections of the Code other than section 1014(f); and
(iv) Any other change that is identified as requiring no supplemental reporting under this section in published guidance in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(4)
Due date of supplemental reporting.
The supplemental reporting required by this paragraph (d) must be filed with the IRS and furnished to each affected beneficiary on or before 30 days after the date on which information becomes available to the executor from which the executor can conclude that a change to the information provided on the Information Return or Statement (or supplement to either) requires supplemental reporting. For changes occurring as a result of supplementing the estate tax return, the date on which the information becomes available to the executor is deemed to be the filing date of the supplemental information. Therefore, for changes occurring as a result of supplementing the estate tax return, the due date of the supplemental reporting required by this paragraph (d) is 30 days after the filing date of the supplemental information. For changes occurring as a result of a determination of final value, the date on which the information becomes available to the executor is deemed to be the date a value becomes the final value under § 1.1014-10(b)(1). Therefore, for changes occurring as a result of a determination of final value, the due date of the supplemental reporting required by this paragraph (d) is 30 days after the date a value becomes the final value under § 1.1014-10(b)(1). However, with regard to property that has not been acquired by a beneficiary on or before the due date described in this paragraph (d)(4) and for which a Statement was not provided to the beneficiary pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the due date may be delayed until the due date described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(5)
Duration of duty to supplement.
An executor's duty to supplement as described in this section continues to apply until a final determination of value for Federal estate tax purposes (a
final value within the meaning of § 1.1014-10(b)(1)) is determined for all property subject to reporting (under paragraph (e) of this section) or, if later, until such property has been acquired by a beneficiary. Therefore, the executor's final supplemental reporting is the reporting to the IRS and the furnishing of Statements to beneficiaries with regard to the last to occur of these two events, assuming that either event would create a change requiring supplemental reporting.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d). In each case, the decedent D was a U.S. citizen and D's executor E was required under section 6018 to file an estate tax return.
(i)
Example 1
—
Change in identified value of property.
D's estate includes stock in a closely-held corporation. E distributes the stock to a beneficiary B of the estate before the due date of the estate tax return. D's executor reports the value of the stock at $14 million on D's estate tax return and on the Statement furnished to B. On examination of D's estate tax return, the IRS adjusts the value of the closely-held stock to $18 million. A court subsequently determines that the fair market value of the closely-held stock for Federal estate tax purposes is $17 million and the court's decision becomes final on June 15th. On or before July 15th of the same year, E must furnish a supplemental Statement to B showing the final value of $17 million for the closely-held stock, and must attach a copy of that supplemental Statement to a supplemental Information Return and file it with the IRS.
(ii)
Example 2
—
Duration of the duty to supplement.
D's gross estate includes stock in closely-held corporation X, stock in closely-held corporation Y, and cash. D's will directs E to distribute 50% of the value of D's estate to A and 50% to B in any manner to which A and B agree. A and B agree that A will take the stock in corporation X and B will take stock in corporation Y and they will divide the cash in such amounts as to cause each to take an equal share of the value D's estate. E timely files D's estate tax return and furnishes a Statement to A and to B pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The IRS accepts the return as filed and the period of limitations on assessment of estate tax expires. Thereafter, A and B agree to revise their agreement. E distributes the stock in corporation X to B and the stock in corporation Y to A in accordance with a revised agreement between A and B. E's final supplemental reporting is the filing of a supplemental Information Return and furnishing of a supplemental Statement to A describing the shares and value of stock distributed to A and a supplemental Statement to B describing the shares and value of stock distributed to B.
(e)
Property for which reporting is required
—(1)
In general.
Except for excepted property subject to only limited reporting as described in paragraph (f) of this section, the property subject to reporting under this section is
included property
and any other property the basis of which is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the included property (for example, property acquired in a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion). For purposes of this section,
included property
is property the value of which is included in the value of the decedent's gross estate as defined in section 2031 or 2103. Generally, included property refers to property whose value is reported on an estate tax return, but it also refers to property whose value otherwise is included in the total value of the gross estate (for example, during examination by the IRS). Thus, included property includes property that qualified, in whole or in part, for an estate tax marital deduction under section 2056, 2056A, or 2106(a)(3) or for an estate tax charitable deduction under section 2055 or 2106(a)(2). It further includes property included in the decedent's gross estate that is distributed to a surviving spouse in satisfaction of that surviving spouse's interest in community property not included in the gross estate that the executor has distributed to a non-spouse pursuant to State law properly applied. However, included property does not include property whose value is not reported on an estate tax return and whose value is not otherwise included in the value of the decedent's gross estate,
such as the property of a deceased nonresident noncitizen that is not subject to United States estate tax, and the surviving spouse's share of community property described in section 1014(b)(6).
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e). In each case, the decedent D was a U.S. citizen and D's executor E was required under section 6018 to file an estate tax return.
(i)
Example 1
—
Included property.
Pursuant to the terms of D's will, a trust is established and funded with property, the value of which is includible in D's gross estate under section 2031. The trust is a charitable remainder annuity trust described in section 664(d)(1). The terms of the trust provide that, in each taxable year during the lifetime of D's surviving spouse S, the trustee must pay to S an annuity of 5% of the initial net fair market value of all property passing to the trust as finally determined for Federal estate tax purposes. Upon the death of S, the trustee must distribute all of the then-principal and income of the trust to organizations described in sections 170(c), 2055(a) and 2522(a) as the trustee selects, in the trustee's sole discretion. The property used to fund the trust is included property and is subject to the reporting requirements of this section. This is true whether or not the requirements of section 1014(f) apply to the property transferred to the trust.
See
§ 1.1014-10(d)(4).
(ii)
Example 2
—
Property the basis of which is determined by reference to the basis of included property.
D's gross estate includes the value of Property A. Before the due date for filing the estate tax return, E exchanges Property A for Property B in a like-kind exchange pursuant to section 1031, for which D's estate recognizes no gain or loss. Property B is property subject to reporting as prescribed in this section. With respect to Property B, the value E reports on the Statement is the value reported for Property A on the estate tax return filed with the IRS.
(f)
Excepted property requiring only limited reporting
—(1)
Excepted property.
Certain included property that is described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (excepted property) is subject to more limited reporting than the reporting required under paragraph (c) of this section. The requirement to file an Information Return with the IRS as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section remains the same even if all property subject to reporting under paragraph (e) of this section is excepted property. However, the executor is not required to identify or provide any other information for excepted property on the Information Return, and the executor is not required to furnish a Statement to the beneficiary with regard to that property. Instead, the executor is required only to report on the Information Return, in accordance with the instructions for that form, that some or all of the property subject to reporting is excepted property described in this paragraph (f). Further, the executor is not required to identify or provide any other information for excepted property on any Statement furnished to a beneficiary and, if this property is the only property that a beneficiary has acquired, an executor is not required to furnish a Statement to that beneficiary.
(2)
List of excepted property.
Excepted property includes—
(i) United States dollars (as defined in paragraph (f)(3) of this section).
(ii) United States dollar-denominated demand deposits.
(iii) Certificates of deposit denominated in United States dollars.
(iv) Cash collateral denominated in United States dollars held by a third party to secure a liability (such as a deposit of purchase money or a security deposit).
(v) Shares of a registered investment company priced in United States dollars that is a money market fund under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (17 CFR 270.2a).
(vi) Life insurance proceeds on the life of the decedent payable in a lump sum in United States dollars.
(vii) Federal, State, and local tax refunds and other refunds payable in United States dollars.
(viii) Notes that are forgiven in full by the decedent upon the decedent's death, whether or not denominated in United States dollars.
(ix) Household and personal effects for which an appraisal is not required under § 20.2031-6(b) of this chapter.
(x) Property that, prior to distribution from the estate or the decedent's revocable trust, is completely sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of in one or more transactions that are recognition events for Federal income tax purposes (whether or not resulting in a gain or loss, and whether or not any gain is capital or ordinary). Such property includes, but is not limited to—
(A) Property distributed in satisfaction of a pecuniary bequest on which the estate recognizes any gain or loss pursuant to § 1.661(a)-2(f);
(B) Property for which an election under section 643(e)(3) has been made for the estate to recognize any gain or loss;
(C) Interests in a business entity that are redeemed for United States dollars prior to being distributed to the beneficiary;
(D) Property disposed of in a transaction described in section 267(a) and (b)(13); and
(E) Property subject to the mark to market accounting method at the time of distribution from the estate or from the decedent's revocable trust.
(xi) Other property having an initial basis that is not in any way determined with regard to or derived from the property's fair market value for Federal estate tax purposes. For purposes of this section, such property includes but is not limited to—
(A) Annuity contracts subject to section 72 and amounts received as an annuity subject to section 72;
(B) An interest in property that consists entirely of the right to receive an item of income in respect of a decedent as defined in section 691;
(C) Amounts received under installment obligations arising from a transaction for which the installment method for determining gain under section 453 applies;
(D) Appreciated property described in section 1014(e) that is acquired by the decedent within 1 year of death;
(E) Stock of a passive foreign investment company subject to section 1296(i), but only if the basis of such stock is the adjusted basis in the hands of the decedent immediately before the decedent's death; and
(F) Interests in and distributions from retirement plans and deferred compensation plans, including individual retirement arrangements as defined in sections 408 and 408A, that are expressed entirely in United States dollars.
(xii) Bonds to the extent that they are redeemed by the issuer for United States dollars prior to being distributed to a beneficiary so that any resulting gain or loss is recognized by the estate.
(xiii) Property included in the gross estate of a beneficiary who died before the due date of the Information Return.
(xiv) Any other property that is identified as excepted property in published guidance in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(3)
United States dollars defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), the term
United States dollars
means the official currency of the United States. The term United States dollars includes physical bills and coins for which the value of each bill or coin is equivalent to the face amount of that bill or coin. This definition does not include other physical United States bills or coins with numismatic value because these bills or coins typically do not have a value equal to their face value.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f). In each case, the decedent D was a U.S. citizen and D's executor E is required under section 6018 to file an estate tax return.
(i)
Example 1
—
Reporting household and personal effects.
Included in D's gross estate are D's household and personal effects. The only item included in D's household and personal effects with a value in excess of $3,000 is a painting. E attaches to D's estate tax return an appraisal of the painting prepared in accordance with § 20.2031-6(b) of this chapter and a room-by-room itemization of D's other household and personal effects prepared in accordance with § 20.2031-6(a) of this chapter. E must furnish to the beneficiary of the painting the Statement required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section. E is not required to report on a Statement furnished to any beneficiary any information about D's other household and personal effects. If a beneficiary of D's
household effects, other than the beneficiary of the painting, has acquired no other property, E is not required to furnish a Statement to that beneficiary. E is required to file the Information Return required by section (c)(1) of this section and attach to that Information Return a copy of the Statement furnished to the beneficiary of the painting. E must disclose on the Information Return that some or all of the property included in D's gross estate is excepted property described in this paragraph (f).
(ii)
Example 2
—
Reporting if property is disposed of in taxable transaction.
Included in D's estate are shares in X, a publicly traded company. Shortly after D's death but prior to the filing of the estate tax return for D's estate, X is acquired by T, also a publicly traded company. In exchange for the shares in X, the estate receives shares in T and cash in a fully taxable transaction. E is required to report on the Information Return required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section that some or all of the property included in D's gross estate is excepted property described in this paragraph (f). E is not required to furnish a Statement to any recipient with respect to the cash, X stock, or T stock.
(iii)
Example 3
—
Reporting if estate is liquidated prior to distribution.
Property A is the only property in D's estate. Prior to filing the estate tax return for D's estate, E sells Property A for $15,000,000. D's estate recognizes gain on the sale of Property A for income tax purposes. E distributes the $15,000,000 among the beneficiaries of D's estate. E must file the Information Return required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section even though all of the property included in D's gross estate is excepted property within the meaning of this paragraph (f). E is not required to furnish to the beneficiaries of D's estate a Statement with regard to Property A, and therefore is not required to attach a copy of any Statement to the Information Return. E is required to file an Information Return with the IRS indicating that all of the property included in D's gross estate is excepted property described in this paragraph (f), and must provide other information as required by the Information Return and the instructions.
(g)
Beneficiaries
—(1)
In general.
Each person who acquires (or will acquire) property from a decedent or by reason of the decedent's death that is subject to the reporting described in paragraph (e) of this section is a beneficiary for purposes of this section and thus is a person to be listed on the Information Return and, except with respect to excepted property (described in paragraph (f) of this section), is a person to whom the executor must furnish a required Statement. Thus, a beneficiary may be:
(i) An individual, including one who is both the executor and a beneficiary, who acquires (or will acquire) property subject to reporting not in trust;
(ii) The estate of a deceased individual who survived the decedent if such individual or estate acquires (or will acquire) property subject to reporting not in trust;
(iii) A trust, whether foreign or domestic, including without limitation a grantor retained annuity trust, charitable remainder trust, and charitable lead trust (each referred to in this section as
beneficiary trusts
); or
(iv) An entity other than a trust, including without limitation a business entity or an organization described in section 501(c).
(2)
Required Statement to beneficiary trust
—(i)
In general.
If a beneficiary trust is the beneficiary to be identified on the Information Return pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the executor must furnish the Statement described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to the trustee rather than to the beneficiaries of the trust. However, if the executor reasonably believes that it is unlikely that the beneficiary trust will depreciate, sell, or otherwise dispose of the property subject to reporting in a recognition event for income tax purposes but instead will distribute the property in kind to the trust beneficiaries, the executor instead may furnish the Statement described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to each of the trust beneficiaries, with copies of the Statements to the trustee. For this purpose, the trust beneficiaries include all potential current income beneficiaries and each remainderman who
would have had a current interest in the trust if one or more of the income beneficiaries had died immediately after the decedent. For purposes of determining the due date of such Statements, each trust beneficiary will be deemed to have acquired the trust property when the trust acquired that property.
(ii)
Beneficiary trust not yet established.
If, by the date required for filing the Information Return with the IRS, a beneficiary trust does not have at least one trustee and a tax identification number, an executor must report on the Information Return that the beneficiary trust has not yet been established in accordance with the instructions. Once the beneficiary trust has been established and the trust information becomes available to the executor, the executor must supplement the required reporting as described in paragraph (d) of this section to update the beneficiary information on the Information Return and Statement.
(3)
Required Statement to the holder of a split interest in property, not in trust.
The beneficiary of a life estate not in trust, and thus the beneficiary to whom the executor is to furnish any required Statement, is the life tenant. Similarly, the beneficiary of a remainder interest not in trust is each remainderman identified as if the life tenant were to die immediately after the decedent. For purposes of determining the due date of the Statements reporting these interests under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, each beneficiary will be deemed to have acquired the property subject to reporting on the date of the decedent's death. The beneficiary of a contingent interest, not in trust, is a beneficiary only if the contingency occurs before the end of the period during which the executor has an obligation to supplement the reporting as provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. If the contingency occurs during this period, the executor must update the beneficiary information on the Information Return and furnish a Statement to that beneficiary pursuant to the executor's duty to supplement to report a change in beneficiary information as described in paragraph (d) of this section. Usufruct interests are treated in the same manner.
(4)
Reporting for a missing beneficiary.
If the executor is unable to locate a beneficiary by the date required for filing the Information Return with the IRS, the executor must report on the Information Return the failure to locate the beneficiary and the efforts the executor has made to locate the beneficiary. The executor must supplement the Information Return and must furnish the required Statement, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, to report the subsequent location of the beneficiary or, if the beneficiary is not located, to report the distribution of the property subject to reporting to a different beneficiary.
(h)
Reporting requirements applicable to trustees
—(1)
Circumstances under which trustees of beneficiary trusts and other trusts are subject to reporting.
Trustees of beneficiary trusts making a distribution of property that was reported on a Statement furnished to those trustees, or of any other property the basis of which is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of property subject to reporting under paragraph (e) of this section, are subject to the reporting requirements described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section and the supplemental reporting requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section (to the extent applicable) with respect to such property. In addition, trustees of trusts that receive a distribution of such property, whether from a beneficiary trust or from any other trust that has received such property, either directly or indirectly, also are subject to these reporting requirements when making a distribution of that property. This reporting obligation imposed on trustees continues to apply for each subsequent transfer or distribution until the property is distributed to a beneficiary not in trust. However, no trustee of a beneficiary trust or of a subsequent recipient trust is subject to the reporting requirements described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section for a disposition of property in a transaction that is a recognition event for income tax purposes (whether or not resulting in a gain or loss) that results in the entire property
having a basis that no longer is related, in whole or in part, to the property's final value or, if applicable, reported value (within the meaning of § 1.1014-10(b)(1) or (2), respectively).
(2)
Required reporting.
On or before January 31 of the calendar year immediately following the year during which occurs a distribution of property subject to reporting under this paragraph (h), the trustee making the distribution must file an Information Return in accordance with the instructions for that form and must furnish a Statement to each recipient of the distribution. For purposes of this section, each recipient is a beneficiary.
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (h). Decedent D was a U.S. citizen and D's executor E was required under section 6018 to file an estate tax return. Pursuant to the will of D, E distributed 100 shares of publicly traded stock in Company X to a trust (Children's Trust) for the benefit of D's two children A and B and their respective issue. E provided a Statement to the trustee of Children's Trust in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Shortly thereafter, pursuant to the terms of Children's Trust, Children's Trust terminates with the 100 shares of Company X stock being distributed in equal shares between Trust A, for the benefit of A and A's issue, and Trust B, for the benefit of B and B's issue. Pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the trustee of Children's Trust files an Information Return with the IRS and furnishes a Statement to the trustees of Trust A and Trust B. Several years later, the trustee of Trust A distributes its 50 shares of Company X stock to C, the only child of A. Pursuant to this paragraph (h), the trustee of Trust A files an Information Return with the IRS and furnishes a Statement to C. Shortly thereafter, C gives the 50 shares of Company X stock, outright, to C's nephew N. C has no obligation to file an Information Return with the IRS or furnish a Statement to N to report the distribution of the 50 shares of Company X stock to N.

§ 1.6037-1
Return of electing small business corporation.
(a)
In general.
Every small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(a)) which has made an election under section 1372(a) not to be subject to the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code shall file, with respect to each taxable year for which the election is in effect, a return of income on Form 1120-S. The return shall set forth the items of gross income and the deductions allowable in computing taxable income as required by the return form or in the instructions issued with respect thereto and shall be signed in accordance with section 6062 by the person authorized to sign a return. The return shall also set forth the following information concerning the electing small business corporation:
(1) The names and addresses of all persons owning stock in the corporation at any time during the taxable year;
(2) The number of shares of stock owned by each shareholder at all times during the taxable year;
(3) The amount of money and other property distributed by the corporation during the taxable year to each shareholder;
(4) The date of each distribution of money and other property; and
(5) Such other information as is required by the form or by the instructions issued with respect to such form.
(b)
Time and place for filing return.
The return shall be filed on or before the 15th day of the third month following the close of the taxable year with the internal revenue officer designated in the instructions applicable to Form 1120-S. (See section 6072.)
(c)
Other provisions.
The return on Form 1120-S will be treated as a return filed by the corporation under section 6012, relating to persons required to make returns of income, for purposes of the provisions of chapter 66 of the Code, relating to limitations. Thus, for example, the period of limitation on assessment and collection of any corporate tax found to be due upon a subsequent determination that the corporation was not entitled to the benefits of subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, will run from the date of filing the return under section 6037, or from the date prescribed for filing such return, whichever is the later. For the rules requiring the disclosure of certain transactions, see § 1.6011-4T.
(d)
Penalties.
For criminal penalties for failure to file a return, supply information, or pay tax, and for filing a false or fraudulent return, statement, or other document, see sections 7203, 7206, and 7207.

If the domestic corporation is a bank, as defined in section 581, or is controlled within the meaning of section 368(c) by a bank, the term “transactions” shall not, as to a corporation with respect to which a return is filed, include banking transactions entered into on behalf of customers; in any event, however, deposits in accounts between a controlled foreign corporation or a foreign subsidiary and the domestic corporation or a 10-percent shareholder described in this subparagraph and withdrawals from such accounts shall be summarized by reporting end-of-month balances.

(j)
Failure to furnish information
—(1)
Effect on foreign tax credit.
(i) Failure by a domestic corporation to furnish, in accordance with the provisions of this section, any return or any information in any return, required to be filed for a taxable year under authority of section 6038 on or before the date prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section (determined with regard to any extension of time for such filing) shall affect the application of section 902 as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. Such failure shall affect the application of section 902 to such domestic corporation or to any person who acquires from any person any portion (but only to the extent of such portion) of the interest of such domestic corporation in any controlled foreign corporation or foreign subsidiary.
(ii) Where the domestic corporation, having filed the return required by this section except for an omission of, or error with respect to, some of the information referred to in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that such omission or error was inadvertent or for reasonable cause and that such domestic corporation has substantially complied with this section, such omission or error shall not constitute a failure under this section.
(2)
Reduction of foreign taxes.
In the application of section 902 to the domestic corporation or person referred to in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph for any taxable year, the amount of taxes paid or deemed paid by each controlled foreign corporation and each foreign subsidiary for the accounting period or periods for which the domestic corporation was required for the taxable year of the failure to furnish information under this section shall be reduced by 10 percent. The 10 percent reduction is not limited to the taxes paid or deemed paid by the controlled foreign corporation or foreign subsidiary with respect to which there is a failure to file information but shall apply to the taxes paid or deemed paid by all controlled foreign corporations and foreign subsidiaries.
(3)
Reduction for continued failure.
(i) If the failure, referred to in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, continues for 90 days or more after date of written notice by the district director to the domestic corporation, then the amount of the reduction referred to in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall be 10 percent plus an additional 5 percent for each 3-month period, or fraction thereof, during which such failure continues after the expiration of such 90-day period.
(ii) Taxes paid by a foreign subsidiary when once reduced for a failure shall not be reduced again for the same failure in their status as taxes deemed
paid by a controlled foreign corporation. Where a failure continues, each additional periodic 5 percent reduction, referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, shall be considered as part of the one reduction.
(4)
Reasonable cause.
(i) For purposes of subsection (b) of section 6038 and this section the time prescribed for furnishing information under this paragraph, and the beginning of the 90-day period after notice by the district director, shall be treated as being not earlier than the last day on which (as shown to the satisfaction of the district director) reasonable cause existed for failure to furnish such information.
(ii) A domestic corporation, which wishes to avoid a reduction in foreign tax credit as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph for failure to furnish information in accordance with this section, must make an affirmative showing of all facts alleged as a reasonable cause for such failure in the form of a written statement containing a declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury.
(5)
Penalties.
The information required by section 6038 of the Code must be furnished even though there are no foreign taxes which would be reduced under the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. For criminal penalties for failure to file a return and filing a false or fraudulent return, see sections 7203, 7206, and 7207 of the Code.

A person in control of a corporation which, in turn, owns more than 50 percent of the combined voting power, or of the value, of all classes of stock of another corporation is also treated as being in control of such other corporation. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Corporation A owns 51 percent of the voting stock in Corporation B. Corporation B owns 51 percent of the voting stock in Corporation C. Corporation C in turn owns 51 percent of the voting stock in Corporation D. Corporation D is controlled by Corporation A.
(c)
Attribution rules.
For the purpose of determining control of domestic or foreign corporations the constructive ownership rules of section 318(a) shall apply except that:
(1) Stock owned by or for a partner or a beneficiary of an estate or trust shall not be considered owned by the partnership, estate, or trust when the effect is to consider a United States person as owning stock owned by a person who is not a United States person;
(2) A corporation will not be considered as owning stock owned by or for a 50 percent or more shareholder when the effect is to consider a United States person as owning stock owned by a person who is not a United States person; and
(3) If 10 percent or more in value of the stock in a corporation is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any person, section 318(a)(2)(C) shall apply.
The constructive ownership rules of section 318(a) apply only for purposes
of determining control as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.

Amounts involving hybrid transactions or hybrid entities under section 267A.
If for the annual accounting period, the corporation pays or accrues interest or royalties for which a deduction is disallowed under section 267A and the regulations in this part under section 267A of the Internal Revenue Code, then Form 5471 (or successor form) must contain such information about the disallowance in the form and manner and to the extent prescribed by the form, instruction, publication, or other guidance.

Hybrid dividends under section 245A(e).
If for the annual accounting period, the corporation pays or receives a hybrid dividend or a tiered hybrid dividend under section 245A(e) and the regulations in this part under section 245A(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, then Form 5471 (or successor form) must contain such information about the hybrid dividend or tiered hybrid dividend in the form and manner and to the extent prescribed by the form, instruction, publication, or other guidance. Form 5471 (or successor form) must also contain any other information relating to the rules of section 245A(e) and the regulations in this part under section 245A(e) of the Internal Revenue Code (including information related to a specified owner's hybrid deduction account), as prescribed by the form, instruction, publication, or other guidance.
(15)
Information reporting under section 250.
If the person required to file Form
5471 (or any successor form) claims a deduction under section 250(a) that is determined, in whole or part, by reference to its foreign-derived intangible income, and any amount required to be reported under paragraph (f)(11) of this section is included in its computation of foreign-derived deduction eligible income, such person will provide on Form 5471 (or any successor form) such information that is prescribed by the form, instructions to the form, publication, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(16)

(ii) A section 245A shareholder with respect to the corporation has an extraordinary disposition account (as defined in § 1.245A-5(i)(6)); or
(iii) The corporation would have been deemed to have undertaken an extraordinary disposition (as defined in § 1.245A-5(i)(5)) but for the application of § 1.245A-5(c)(3)(ii)(C)(
2
).
(17)
Reporting of disqualified basis and disqualified payments.
If for the annual accounting period of a corporation it holds an item of property having disqualified basis within the meaning of § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii) or § 1.951A-2(c)(5), or incurs an item of deduction or loss related to a disqualified payment (within the meaning of § 1.951A-2(c)(6)(ii)(A)), then Form 5471 (or successor form) must contain such information about the disqualified basis, or such information relating to the disqualified payment, in the form and manner and to the extent prescribed by the form, instructions to the form, publication, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(18)
Adjustments to extraordinary disposition accounts and disqualified basis.
If for the annual accounting period a section 245A shareholder of the corporation reduces its extraordinary disposition account pursuant to § 1.245A-7(c) or § 1.245A-8(c), as applicable, or the corporation reduces the disqualified basis in an item of specified property pursuant to § 1.245A-7(b) or § 1.245A-8(b), as applicable, then Form 5471 (or a successor form) must contain such information about the reduction to the extraordinary disposition account or disqualified basis, as applicable, in the form and manner and to the extent prescribed by the form, instructions to the form, publication, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(g)

The foreign corporation's functional currency is determined under section 985. All statements submitted on or with the return required under this section shall be rendered in the English language.
(i)
Time and place for filing return.
Returns on Form 5471 required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed with the United States person's income tax return on or before the date required by law for the filing of that person's income tax return. Directors of Field Operations and Field Directors are authorized to grant reasonable extensions of time for filing returns on Form 5471 in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 1.6081-1 of this chapter. An application for an extension of time for filing a return of income shall also be considered as an application for an extension of time for filing returns on Form 5471.
(j)
Two or more persons required to submit the same information
—(1)
Return jointly made.
If two or more persons are required to furnish information with respect to the same foreign corporation for the same period, such persons may, in lieu of making separate returns, jointly make one return. Such joint return shall be filed with the income tax return of any one of the persons making such joint return.
(2)
Persons excepted from furnishing information
—(i)
Conditions.
Any person required to furnish information under this section with respect to a foreign corporation need not furnish that information provided all of the following conditions are met:
(A) Such person does not directly own an interest in the foreign corporation;
(B) Such person is required to furnish the information solely by reason of attribution of stock ownership from a United States person under paragraph (c) of this section; and
(C) The person from whom the stock ownership is attributed furnishes all of the information required under this section of the person to whom the stock ownership is attributed. (For a rule regarding attribution from a nonresident alien, see paragraph (l) of this section).
(ii) If an individual who is a United States person required to furnish information with respect to a foreign corporation under section 6038 is entitled under a treaty to be treated as a nonresident of the United States, and if the individual claims this treaty benefit, and if there are no other United States persons that are required to furnish information under section 6038 with respect to the foreign corporation, then the individual may satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (f)(10), (f)(11), (g), and (h) of this section by filing the audited foreign financial statements of the foreign corporation with the individual's return required under section 6038.
(iii)
Illustrations.
The rule of this paragraph (j)(2) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a U.S. person owns 100 percent of the stock of M, a domestic corporation. A also owns 100 percent of the stock of N, a foreign corporation organized under the laws of foreign country Y. A, in filing the information return required by this section with respect to N Corporation, in fact furnishes all of the information required of M Corporation with respect to N Corporation. M Corporation need not file the information.

# Example 2.
X, a domestic corporation owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, a domestic corporation, Y Corporation owns 100 percent of
the stock of Z, a foreign corporation. X Corporation is not excused by this paragraph (j)(2) from filing information with respect to Z Corporation because X Corporation is deemed to control Z Corporation under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section without recourse to the attribution rules in paragraph (c) of this section.
(3)
Statement required.
Any United States person required to furnish information under this section with his return who does not do so by reason of the provisions of paragraph (j)(1) of this section shall file a statement with his income tax return indicating that such requirement has been (or will be) satisfied and identifying the return with which the information was or will be filed and the place of filing.
(k)
Failure to furnish information
—(1)
Dollar amount penalty
—(i)
In general.
If any person required to file Form 5471 under section 6038 and this section fails to furnish any information described in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section within the time prescribed by paragraph (i) of this section, such person shall pay a penalty of $10,000 for each annual accounting period of each foreign corporation with respect to which such failure occurs.
(ii)
Increase in penalty for continued failure after notification.
If a failure described in paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section continues for more than 90 days after the date on which the Director of Field Operations, Area Director, or Director of Compliance Campus Operations mails notice of such failure to the person required to file Form 5471, such person shall pay a penalty of $10,000, in addition to the penalty imposed by section 6038(b)(1) and paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section, for each 30-day period (or a fraction of) during which such failure continues after such 90-day period has expired. The additional penalty imposed by section 6038(b)(2) and this paragraph (k)(1)(ii) shall be limited to a maximum of $50,000 for each failure.
(2)
Penalty of reducing foreign tax credit
—(i)
Effect on foreign tax credit.
Failure of a United States person to furnish, in accordance with the provisions of this section, any return or any information in any return, required to be filed for a taxable year under authority of section 6038 on or before the date prescribed in paragraph (i) of this section may affect the application of section 901 as provided in paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section and may affect the application of sections 902 and 960 as provided in paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section. Such failure may affect the application of sections 902 and 960 to any such United States person which is a corporation or to any person who acquires from any other person any portion (but only to the extent of such portion) of the interest of such other person in any such foreign corporation.
(ii)
Application of section 901.
In the application of section 901 to a United States person referred to in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, the amount of taxes paid or deemed paid by such person for any taxable year, with or within which the annual accounting period of a foreign corporation for which such person failed to furnish information required under this section ended, may be reduced by 10 percent. However, no tax reduced under paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section or deemed paid under section 904(c) shall be reduced under the provisions of this paragraph (k)(2)(ii).
(iii)
Application of sections 902 and 960.
In the application of sections 902 and 960 to a United States person referred to in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section for any taxable year, the amount of taxes paid or deemed paid by each foreign corporation for the accounting period or periods for which such person was required for the taxable year of the failure to furnish information under this section may be reduced by 10 percent. The 10-percent reduction is not limited to the taxes paid or deemed paid by the foreign corporation with respect to which there is a failure to file information but may apply to the taxes paid or deemed paid by all foreign corporations controlled by that person. In applying subsections (a) and (b) of section 902, and in applying subsection (a) of section 960, the reduction provided by this paragraph (k)(2) shall not apply for purposes of determining the amount of accumulated profits in excess of income, war profits, and excess profits taxes.
(iv)
Reduction for continued failure after notice.
(A) If the failure referred to in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section continues for more than 90 days after
the date on which the Director of Field Operations mails notice of such failure to such United States person, then the amount of the reduction referred to in paragraphs (k)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section may be 10 percent plus an additional 5 percent for each 3-month period, or fraction thereof, during which such failure continues after the expiration of such 90-day period.
(B) No taxes shall be reduced under this paragraph (k)(2) more than once for the same failure. Taxes paid by a foreign corporation when once reduced for a failure shall not be reduced again for the same failure in their status as taxes deemed paid by a corporate shareholder. Where a failure continues, each additional periodic 5-percent reduction, referred to in paragraph (k)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, shall be considered as part of the one reduction.
(v)
Limitation on reduction of foreign tax credit.
The amount of the reduction under this paragraph (k)(2) for each failure to furnish information with respect to a foreign corporation as required under this section shall not exceed the greater of:
(A) $10,000, or
(B) The income of the foreign corporation for its annual accounting period with respect to which the failure occurs. For purposes of this section if a person is required to furnish information with respect to more than one foreign corporation, controlled (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section) by that person, each failure to submit information for each such corporation constitutes a separate failure.
(vi)
Offset for dollar amount penalty imposed.
The total amount of the reduction or reductions which, but for this paragraph (k)(2)(vi), may be made under this paragraph (k)(2) with respect to any separate failure, shall not exceed the maximum amount of such reductions which may be imposed, reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of the dollar amount penalty imposed by paragraph (k)(1) of this section with respect to such separate failure.
(3)
Reasonable cause.
(i) For purposes of section 6038 (b) and (c) and this section, the time prescribed for furnishing information under paragraph (i) of this section, and the beginning of the 90-day period after mailing of notice by the Director of Field Operations under paragraphs (k)(1)(ii) and (2)(iv)(A) of this section, shall be treated as being not earlier than the last day on which reasonable cause existed for failure to furnish the information.
(ii) To show that reasonable cause existed for failure to furnish information as required by section 6038 and this section, the person required to report such information must make an affirmative showing of all facts alleged as reasonable cause for such failure in a written statement containing a declaration that it is made under the penalties of prejury. The statement must be filed with the district director for the district or the director of the service center where the return is required to be filed. The district director or the director of the service center shall determine whether the failure to furnish information was due to reasonable cause, and if so, the period of time for which such reasonable cause existed. In the case of a return that has been filed as required by this section except for an omission of, or error with respect to, some of the information required, if the person who filed the return establishes to the satisfaction of the district director or the director of the service center that the person has substantially complied with this section, then the omission or error shall not constitute a failure under this section.
(4)
Other penalties.
The information required by section 6038 and this section must be furnished even though there are no foreign taxes which would be reduced under the provisions of this section, and even though the information required may not affect the amount of any tax due under the Internal Revenue Code. For criminal penalties for failure to file a return and filing a false or fraudulent return, see sections 7203, 7206, and 7207 of the Code.
(5)
Illustrations.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
M, a domestic corporation owns 100 percent of the stock of N, a foreign corporation. Both M and N use the calendar year as a taxable year and annual accounting period, and all of the following events occur in or with respect to the 1980 taxable year. The dividend from N is the only dividend from a foreign corporation received by
M during the taxable year, and the foreign taxes listed are the only foreign taxes paid or deemed paid by M and N for the taxable year. On March 15, 1981, M filed its income tax return and paid its income tax, but M did not file Form 2952 with respect to N's 1980 annual accounting period. On June 1, 1961, the district director mailed notice to M of M's failure to file Form 2952 with respect to N. On November 30, 1981, M filed a complete Form 2952 with respect to N's 1980 annual accounting period.
(a) Gains, profits, and income of N
$100,000
(b) Foreign tax paid by N with respect to such gains, profits, and income
40,000
(c) Reduction of foreign tax paid by N (for purposes of M's section 902 deemed paid credit) resulting from M's failure to file information with respect to N as required under section 6038(a) and this section: failure to file within the time prescribed in paragraph (i) of this section, 10-percent reduction; continued failure for one additional 3-month period after 90-day period after notice mailed, 5-percent reduction; total reduction, 15 percent ($40,000 times 15 percent)
6,000
(d) Foreign tax paid by N after section 6038(c)(1)(B) reduction
34,000
(e) Dividend paid by N to M
45,000
(f) Accumulated profits of N as defined in section 902(c)(1) (determined without regard to the section 6038(c)(1)(B) reduction)
100,000
(g) Accumulated profits of N as described in section 902(a) (determined without regard to the section 6038(c)(1)(B) reduction)
60,000
(h) For purposes of the section 902 credit, M is deemed to have paid the same proportion of foreign taxes paid (reduced as provided under section 6038(c)) with respect to the accumulated profits described in section 902(a) (determined without regard to the reduction provided under section 6038(c)) as the amount of the dividend (determined without regard to section 78) bears to such amount of accumulated profits
25,500
(45,000 ÷ 60,000) × 34,000 = 25,500
M must include $25,500 in gross income as a dividend under the provisions of section 78 of the Code. This example illustrates that the reductions in foreign taxes paid by the foreign corporation provided under section 8038(c) are taken into account in determining the amount included in gross income of the domestic corporation under section 78 of the Code as foreign taxes deemed paid, but such reductions are not taken into account in computing accumulated profits for purposes of determining the portion of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to a particular dividend. The dollar amount penalty imposed by section 8038 (b) and paragraph (k)(1) of this section does not apply with respect to information for annual accounting periods ending before September 4, 1982, and therefore does not apply to M with respect to M's failure to file Form 2952 in this example.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that all of the events occur in or with respect to the 1982 taxable year. On March 15, 1983. M filed its income tax return and paid its income tax, but M did not file Form 2952 or Form 5471 with respect to N's 1982 annual accounting period. On June 1, 1983, the district director mailed notice to M of M's failure to file Form 2952 or Form 5471 with respect to N. On November 30, 1983, M filed a complete Form 5471 with respect to N's 1982 annual accounting period. Under paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section, M is subject to a penalty of $1,000. Under paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section, that penalty is increased by $4,000 because the failure continued for 92 days (three full 30-day periods and a fraction of a fourth 30-day period) after the end of the 90-day period following mailing of the notice by the district director, bringing M's dollar amount penalty under paragraph (k)(1) of this section to $5,000. For purpose of determining the foreign tax credit available to M, there may be imposed a reduction of foreign tax paid by N of $6,000, which would be the total of reductions under paragraph (k)(2) of this section with respect to M's failure to file under section 6038 for N's 1982 annual accounting period, before application of paragraph (k)(2)(vi) of this section. Under said paragraph (k)(2)(vi), the amount of the foreign tax reduction imposed is reduced by the amount of the dollar amount penalty, leaving a foreign tax reduction penalty of $1,000 which may be imposed in addition to the $5,000 dollar amount penalty. If imposed, the $1,000 tax reduction would then be applied in the calculation of taxes deemed paid by M under section 902 as in example (1), items (c), (d), and (h).

# Example 3.
A, a U.S. person, owns 100 percent of the stock of FC. On April 15, 2008, A timely filed its 2007 income tax return but did not file Form 5471 with respect to FC's 2007 annual accounting period. On June 1, 2008, the Director of Field Operations mailed a notice to A of A's failure to file Form 5471 for 2007 with respect to FC. On August 1, 2008, A submits a written statement asserting facts for reasonable cause for failure to file the 2007 Form 5471 for FC. Based on A's statement and discussions with A, the Director of Field Operations agrees that A had reasonable cause for failure to file FC's 2007 Form 5471 and determined that it is reasonable for A to file FC's 2007 Form 5471 by September 15, 2008. The time prescribed for furnishing information under paragraph (i) of this section is September 15, 2008, and the 90-day period described under paragraphs (k)(1)(ii) and (k)(2)(iv)(A) of this section begins on that same date. Thus, if A files a
completed Form 5471 by September 15, 2008, A is not subject to the penalties under paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section. If A does not file a completed Form 5471 by December 14, 2008, in addition to the penalties under paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section, A will also be subject to the penalties for continued failure under paragraphs (k)(1)(ii) and (k)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
except A submits the written statement to the Director before a notice of failure to furnish information is mailed to A. The notice is mailed to A on September 7, 2008. Under these facts, the time prescribed for furnishing information under paragraph (i) of this section is September 15, 2008, and the 90-day period after mailing of notice of failure under paragraphs (k)(1)(ii) and (k)(2)(iv)(A) of this section begins on that same date.
(l)
Other persons excepted from filing.
For tax years of foreign corporations ending on or after December 29, 1999, any person required to furnish information under this section with respect to a foreign corporation does not have to furnish that information if the following conditions are met—
(1) Such person does not own a direct or indirect interest in the foreign corporation; and
(2) Such person is required to furnish information solely by reason of attribution of stock ownership from a nonresident alien(s) under paragraph (c) of this section.

§ 1.6038-3
Information returns required of certain United States persons with respect to controlled foreign partnerships (CFPs).
(a)
Persons required to make return
—(1)
Controlling fifty-percent partners.
The term
controlling fifty-percent partner
means a United States person that controlled (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) the foreign partnership at any time during the partnership's tax year (as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section). Except as provided in paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, for each tax year of a foreign partnership during which the partnership has one or more controlling fifty-percent partners, each controlling fifty-percent partner must complete and file Form 8865, “Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Partnerships,” containing the information described in paragraph (g) of this section.
(2)
Controlling ten-percent partners.
If at any point during a foreign partnership's tax year (as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section) a United States person owned a ten-percent or greater interest in the partnership while the partnership was controlled by United States persons owning ten-percent or greater interests, such United States person is a controlling ten-percent
partner. See paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the definition of control. However, a United States person is not a controlling ten-percent partner with respect to a particular foreign partnership for a particular tax year of the foreign partnership if at any point during that year the partnership had a controlling fifty-percent partner, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, for each tax year of a partnership during which the partnership has controlling ten-percent partners, each controlling ten-percent partner must complete and file Form 8865 containing the information described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(3)
Separate returns for each partnership.
A United States person required to report under this paragraph (a) must file a separate Form 8865 for each foreign partnership with respect to which the person is a controlling fifty-percent partner or a controlling ten-percent partner.

Control.
Control of a foreign partnership is ownership of more than a fifty-percent interest in the partnership.
(2)
Fifty-percent interest.
A fifty-percent interest in a partnership is an interest equal to fifty percent of the capital interest in such partnership, an interest equal to fifty percent of the profits interest in such partnership, or an interest to which fifty percent of the deductions or losses of such partnership are allocated.
(3)
Ten-percent interest.
A ten-percent interest in a partnership is an interest equal to ten percent of the capital interest in such partnership, an interest equal to ten percent of the profits interest in such partnership, or an interest to which ten percent of the deductions or losses of such partnership are allocated.
(4)
Constructive ownership rules.
For purposes of determining an interest in a partnership, the constructive ownership rules of section 267(c) (other than section 267(c)(3)) apply, taking into account that such rules refer to corporations and not to partnerships. However, an interest will be attributed from a nonresident alien under the family attribution rules of section 267(c)(2) and (4) only if the person to whom the interest is attributed owns a direct or indirect (under the rules of 267(c)(1) or (5)) interest in the foreign partnership.
(5)
Determination of amount of interest.
Whether a person owns a fifty-percent interest, or a ten-percent interest, as described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, is determined for each tax year of the foreign partnership by reference to the agreement of the partners relating to such interests during that tax year.
(6)
Definition of United States person.
The term
United States person
is defined in section 7701(a)(30).
(7)
Definition of a foreign partnership.
A foreign partnership is a partnership described in section 7701(a)(5).
(8)
Tax year of a foreign partnership.
The tax year of a foreign partnership is determined under section 706.
(9)
Examples.
The rules of paragraph (a) of this section and this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Sole U.S. partner does not own more than a fifty-percent interest. No United States person owns any interest (directly or constructively) in
FPS,
a foreign partnership whose tax year under section 706 is the calendar year. On January 1, 2001,
US,
a United States person with the calendar year as its tax year, contributes property to
FPS
in exchange for a 40% interest in a section 721 transaction. No United States persons acquire directly or constructively any other interests in
FPS
during
FPS
's 2001 tax year.
US
is not a controlling fifty-percent partner during
FPS
's 2001 tax year.
US
did not own during that tax year, either directly or constructively, more than a 50% interest in the partnership under paragraphs (b)(2) and (4) of this section. Also,
US
is not a controlling ten-percent partner; although
US
owned a 10% or greater interest,
US
persons owning at least 10% interests did not control
FPS.
Therefore,
US
does not have to file with its 2001 income tax return a Form 8865 with respect to
FPS
under section 6038. (But see section 6038B for the reporting obligations of
US
with respect to its transfer of property to
FPS
and section 6046A for the reporting obligation of
US
with respect to its acquisition of an interest in
FPS.
See also § 1.6046A-1(f)(1) regarding the overlap between sections 6038B and 6046A.

# Example 2.
Controlling ten-percent partners. Assume the same facts as in
Example 1.
In addition, on January 1, 2002,
US1,
a United States person unrelated to
US
and a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a 15% interest in
FPS
from a foreign partner of
FPS.
Neither
US
nor
US1
is a controlling fifty-percent partner during
FPS
's 2002 tax year because neither one owns more than a 50% percent interest in
FPS
during that year. However,
US
and
US1
are controlling ten-percent partners for that year because each owns at least a 10% interest (
US
owns a 40% interest and
US1
owns a 15% interest) and together they control
FPS
because collectively they own more than a 50% interest in
FPS.
As controlling ten-percent partners, under section 6038, each is required to file a Form 8865 with its 2002 income tax return. (
US1
must also report its acquisition of the 15% interest in
FPS
under section 6046A on its Form 8865 filed with its 2002 income tax return.)

# Example 3.
Constructive ownership rules. Assume the same facts as in
Example 2.
In addition, on January 1, 2003,
US2,
a United States person and the brother of
US,
purchases 50% of the stock of
FC,
a foreign corporation.
FC
owns a 20% interest in
FPS.
Thus, under sections 6038(e)(3) and 267(c)(1),
US2
indirectly owns a 10% interest in
FPS
(10% is
US2
's proportionate share of
FC
's 20% interest in
FPS
), and under sections 6038(e)(3) and 267(c)(2),
US2
is attributed
US
's 40% interest. Additionally,
US
directly owns a 40% interest in
FPS
and is attributed
US2
's 10% interest pursuant to section 6038(e)(3) and section 267(c)(2). Therefore,
US2
is considered to own a 50% interest (10% indirectly and 40% from
US
) in
FPS,
and
US
is considered to own a 50% interest in
FPS
(40% directly and 10% from
US2
).
FPS
has no controlling fifty-percent partners, because neither
US, US1,
nor
US2,
owns a greater than 50% interest. However,
US, US1,
and
US2
are each controlling ten-percent partners and each must file Form 8865 pursuant to section 6038 for
FPS
's 2003 tax year ending December 31, 2003. Each must attach Form 8865 to its tax return for its 2003 tax year.

# Example 4.
Controlling fifty-percent partners. Assume the same facts as in
Example 3.
In addition, on June 1, 2004,
US
acquires an additional 1% direct interest in
FPS. US
is now a controlling fifty-percent partner of
FPS,
because
US
owns a 41% interest directly and a 10% interest constructively from
US2. US2
is also a controlling fifty-percent partner, because
US2
owns 10% indirectly and 41% constructively from
US.
Both
US
and
US2
are required to file Form 8865 containing all the information required to be submitted by controlling fifty-percent partners. (But see paragraph (c)(1) of this section, which contains filing exceptions when there are multiple controlling fifty-percent partners).
US1
is no longer a controlling ten-percent partner because
FPS
now has at least one controlling fifty-percent partner, and
US1
does not qualify as a controlling fifty-percent partner. Therefore,
US1
is not required to file Form 8865 under section 6038.

# Example 5.
Constructive ownership from a nonresident alien.
US,
a United States person, does not own directly or constructively an interest in
FPS,
a foreign partnership. The tax year of
FPS
is the calendar year.
NRA,
a nonresident alien, is the mother of
US.
In 2002,
NRA
acquires a 55% interest in
FPS.
Because
US
owns neither a direct nor a constructive interest in
FPS
under sections 6038(e)(3) and 267(c)(1) or (5),
NRA
's interest is not attributed to
US
under sections 6038(e)(3) and 267(c)(2). If in 2003
NRA
becomes a United States person,
NRA
's interest will be attributed to
US.
However,
US
is excused from filing Form 8865 if
US
satisfies the requirements of the constructive owners exception in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In 2003,
NRA
is a controlling fifty-percent partner and must file a Form 8865 under section 6038 for
FPS
's 2003 tax year.
(c)
Exceptions when more than one United States person is required to file Form 8865 pursuant to section 6038
—(1)
Multiple controlling fifty-percent partners
—(i)
In general.
If, with respect to the same foreign partnership for the same tax year, more than one United States person is a controlling fifty-percent partner, then in lieu of each controlling fifty-percent partner filing a separate Form 8865, only one Form 8865 from one of the controlling fifty-percent partners is required, provided all of the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section are satisfied. A person that is a controlling fifty-percent partner solely because of an interest to which deductions or losses are allocated may file the single return only if there is no United States person that is a controlling fifty-percent partner by reason of an interest in capital or profits.
(ii)
Requirements
—(A) The person undertaking the filing obligation must file Form 8865 with that person's income tax return in the manner provided by Form 8865 and the accompanying instructions. The return must contain all of the information that would have been required to be reported by this section if each controlling fifty-percent partner had filed its own Form 8865.
(B) Any controlling fifty-percent partner not filing Form 8865 must file with its income tax return a statement titled “Controlled Foreign Partnership Reporting” containing the following information—
(
1
) A statement that the person qualified as a controlling fifty-percent partner, but is not submitting Form 8865 pursuant to the multiple controlling fifty-percent partners exception;
(
2
) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number (if any) of the foreign partnership of which the person qualified as a controlling fifty-percent partner;
(
3
) A representation that the filing requirement has been or will be satisfied;
(
4
) The name and address of the person filing the single return;
(
5
) The Internal Revenue Service Center where the single return is required to be filed; and
(
6
) Any additional information that Form 8865 and the accompanying instructions require.
(iii)
Penalties.
If the requirements listed in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section are not satisfied, a United States person that did not file a Form 8865 pursuant to this paragraph will be subject to the penalties in paragraph (k) of this section, unless the reasonable cause provision in paragraph (k)(4) of this section is satisfied.
(2)
Certain constructive owners excepted from furnishing information
—(i)
In general.
A United States person that does not own a direct interest in the foreign partnership and that is required to file Form 8865 under this section solely by reason of constructive ownership from a United States person(s) pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section (an indirect partner) is not required to file Form 8865 if all of the requirements listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are met.
(ii)
Requirements
—(A) The United States person(s) whose interest the indirect partner constructively owns reports all the information such person(s) is required to submit under this section, unless such person also is required to file solely by reason of constructive ownership from a United States person(s) pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, or another person reports the information pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(B) The indirect partner files with its income tax return a statement titled “Controlled Foreign Partnership Reporting” containing the following information—
(
1
) A representation that the indirect partner was required to file Form 8865, but is not doing so pursuant to the constructive owners exception;
(
2
) The names and addresses of the United States persons whose interests the indirect partner constructively owns;
(
3
) The name and address of the foreign partnership with respect to which the indirect partner would have had to have filed Form 8865 but for this exception; and
(
4
) Any additional information that Form 8865 and the accompanying instructions require.
(iii)
Penalties.
A United States person that pursuant to this paragraph (c)(2) does not file a return will be subject to the penalties in paragraph (k) of this section if the requirements listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are not satisfied, unless such failure is due to reasonable cause, as defined in paragraph (k)(4) of this section.
(iv)
Overlap with multiple controlling fifty-percent partners exception
—(A) If a United States person qualifies for both the exception in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the exception in this paragraph (c)(2), such person may only utilize the multiple controlling fifty-percent partners exception in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to avoid filing Form 8865.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates the operation of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv):

# Example.
US is a U.S. citizen.
US
owns 100% of the stock of
DC,
a domestic corporation.
DC
owns a 60% direct interest in
FPS,
a foreign partnership.
DC
and
US
are the only U.S. persons that own interests directly or constructively in
FPS. DC
owns directly a greater than 50% interest in
FPS. US
constructively owns
DC
's interest pursuant to sections 6038(e)(3) and 267(c)(1). Therefore, both
DC
and
US
are controlling fifty-percent partners.
US
qualifies for both the exception in paragraph (c)(1) of this section (multiple controlling fifty-percent partners) and the exception in paragraph (c)(2) of this section (constructive owner exception).
US
may only utilize the paragraph (c)(1) exception to avoid its filing obligation. Accordingly,
DC
may file a single Form 8865 on behalf of
US
and itself. However, that form must contain all the information that would have been
submitted had
DC
and
US
each submitted a separate Form 8865.
(3)
Members of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return.
If one or more members of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return are required under section 6038 to file a Form 8865 for a particular foreign partnership, the common parent corporation may file one Form 8865 on behalf of all of the members of the group required to report under section 6038. Except with respect to group members who also qualify under the exception in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Form 8865 must contain all the information that would have been required to be submitted if each group member were required to file its own Form 8865.
(d)
Exception for certain trusts.
Trusts relating to state and local government employee retirement plans are not required to report under this section, unless the instructions to Form 8865 provide otherwise.
(e)
Reporting under this section not required with respect to partnerships excluded from the application of subchapter K.
The reporting requirements of this section will not apply to any United States person in respect of an eligible partnership as described in § 1.761-2(a) if such partnership has validly elected to be excluded from all of the provisions of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code in the manner specified in § 1.761-2(b)(2)(i), or such partnership is deemed to have elected to be excluded from all of the provisions of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code in accordance with the provisions of § 1.761-2(b)(2)(ii).
(f)
Period covered by return.
The information required under this section must be furnished for the tax year of the foreign partnership ending with or within the United States person's tax year. See section 706 for rules regarding tax years of partnerships.
(g)
Contents of return
—(1)
Information required to be submitted by controlling fifty-percent partners and controlling ten-percent partners.
All controlling fifty-percent partners and all controlling ten-percent partners must submit the following information on Form 8865 in the form and manner and to the extent prescribed by Form 8865 and its instructions—

(ii) A statement of the income, gain, losses, deductions and credits allocated to the direct interest in the partnership of the person reporting under section 6038;
(iii) A list of all partnerships (foreign or domestic) in which the foreign partnership owned a direct interest, or owned a constructive interest of ten percent of more under the rules of section 267(c)(1) or (5), during the partnership's tax year for which the Form 8865 is being filed;
(iv) Information about all foreign entities that were disregarded as entities separate from their owner under §§ 301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3 that were owned by the foreign partnership during the partnership's tax year for which the Form 8865 is being filed;
(v) A summary of the transactions that took place during the partnership's tax year between the partnership and the person filing the return, between the partnership and any other partnership of which the person filing the return is a controlling fifty-percent partner, and between the partnership and any corporation controlled (under section 6038(e)(2) and the regulations thereunder) by the person filing the return; and
(vi) Any other information that Form 8865 or its accompanying instructions require to be submitted.
(2)
Additional information required to be submitted by controlling fifty-percent partners.
In addition to the information required pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, controlling fifty-percent partners must also submit the following information in the form and manner and to the extent required by Form 8865 and its instructions—
(i) A list of the names, addresses and tax identification numbers (if any) of each United States person that owned a direct interest of ten percent or more in the partnership during the partnership's tax year, and of each United
States and foreign person whose interests in the partnership the controlling fifty-percent partner constructively owned under paragraph (b)(4) of this section during the partnership's tax year;
(ii) A list of transactions between the partnership and any United States person owning at the time of the transaction at least a 10-percent direct interest (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) in the foreign partnership;
(iii) A statement of the aggregate of the partners' distributive shares of items of income, gain, losses, deductions and credits;
(iv) A statement of income, gain, losses, deductions and credits allocated to each United States person holding a direct interest in the foreign partnership of ten percent or more; and
(v) Any other information Form 8865 or its accompanying instructions require controlling fifty-percent partners to submit.
(3)
Amounts involving hybrid transactions or hybrid entities under section 267A.
In addition to the information required pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, if, during the partnership's taxable year for which the Form 8865 is being filed, the partnership paid or accrued interest or royalties for which a deduction is disallowed under section 267A and the regulations in this part under section 267A, the controlling fifty-percent partners must provide information about the disallowance in the form and manner and to the extent prescribed by Form 8865 (or successor form), instruction, publication, or other guidance.
(4)
Additional information required to be submitted by a controlling ten-percent or a controlling fifty-percent partner that has a deduction under section 250 by reason of FDII.
In addition to the information required pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, if, with respect to the partnership's tax year for which the Form 8865 is being filed, a controlling ten-percent partner or a controlling fifty-percent partner has a deduction under section 250 (by reason of having foreign-derived intangible income), determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the income, assets, or activities of the partnership, or transactions between the controlling-ten percent partner or controlling fifty-percent partner and the partnership, the controlling ten-percent partner or controlling fifty-percent partner must provide its share of the partnership's gross DEI, gross FDDEI, deductions that are properly allocable to the partnership's gross DEI and gross FDDEI, and partnership QBAI (as those terms are defined in the section 250 regulations) in the form and manner and to the extent prescribed by Form 8865 (or any successor form), instructions to the form, publication, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. To the extent that the partnership amounts described in the previous sentence cannot be determined, the controlling ten-percent partner or controlling fifty-percent partner must provide its share of the partnership's attributes that the partner uses to determine the partner's gross DEI, gross FDDEI, deductions that are properly allocable to the partner's gross DEI and gross FDDEI, and the partner's adjusted bases in partnership specified tangible property.
(h)
Method of reporting.
Except as otherwise provided on Form 8865 or the accompanying instructions, all amounts required to be furnished on Form 8865 must be expressed in United States dollars. All statements required on or with Form 8865 pursuant to this section must be in English.
(i)
Time and place for filing return
—(1)
In general.
Form 8865 must be filed with the United States person's income tax return on or before the due date (including extensions) of that return. If the United States person is not required to file an income tax return for its tax year with which or within which the foreign partnership's tax year ends, but is required to file an information return for that year (for example, Form 1065, “U.S. Partnership Return of Income,” or Form 990, “Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax”), the Form 8865 must be filed with the United States person's information return filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of that return.
(2)
Duplicate return.
If required by the instructions to Form 8865, a duplicate Form 8865 (including attachments and schedules) must also be filed.
(j)
Overlap with section 6031.
A partner may be required to file Form 8865 under this section and the foreign partnership in which it is a partner may also be required to file a Form 1065 or Form 1065-B under section 6031(e) for the same partnership tax year. For cases where a United States person is a controlling fifty-percent partner or a controlling ten-percent partner with respect to a foreign partnership, and that foreign partnership completes and files Form 1065 or Form 1065-B, the instructions for Form 8865 will specify the filing requirements that address this overlap in reporting obligations.
(k)
Failure to comply with reporting requirement
—(1)
In general.
Any United States person required to file Form 8865 under Section 6038 and this section that fails to comply (as defined in paragraph (k)(2) of this section) with the reporting requirements of this section, will be subject to the penalties described in paragraph (k)(3) of this section.
(2)
Failure to comply.
A failure to comply is separately determined for each foreign partnership for which a United States person has a section 6038 reporting obligation. A failure to comply with the requirements of section 6038 includes the following—
(i) The failure to report at the proper time and in the proper manner any information required to be reported under the rules of this section; or
(ii) The provision of false or inaccurate information in purported compliance with the requirements of this section.
(3)
Penalties.
A United States person that fails to comply (as defined in paragraph (k)(2) of this section) with the reporting requirements of this section must pay the following penalties, subject to the reasonable cause exception in paragraph (k)(4) of this section:
(i)
Dollar amount penalty
—(A)
$10,000 penalty.
A penalty of $10,000 shall be imposed for each tax year of each foreign partnership with respect to which a failure to comply occurs.
(B)
Increase in penalty.
If a failure to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of section 6038 and this section continues for more than 90 days after the date on which the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate mails notice of the failure to the United States person required to file Form 8865, the person must pay an additional penalty of $10,000 for each 30-day period (or fraction thereof) during which the failure continues after the 90-day period has expired.
(C)
Limitation.
The additional penalty imposed on any United States person by section 6038(b)(2) and paragraph (k)(3)(i)(B) of this section is limited to a maximum of $50,000 for each partnership for each tax year with respect to which the failure occurs.
(ii)
Penalty of reducing foreign tax credit
—(A)
Effect on foreign tax credit.
Failure to comply with the reporting requirements of section 6038 and this section may cause a reduction of foreign tax credits under section 901 (taxes of foreign countries and of possessions of the United States). In applying section 901 to a United States person for any tax year with or within which its foreign partnership's tax year ended, the amount of taxes paid (and deemed paid under sections 902 and 960) by the United States person will be reduced by 10 percent if the person fails to comply. However, no tax deemed paid under section 904(c) will be reduced under the provisions of this paragraph (k)(3)(ii).
(B)
Reduction for continued failure.
If a failure to comply with the reporting requirements of section 6038 and this section continues for more than 90 days after the date on which the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate mails notice of the failure to the person required to file Form 8865, then the amount of the reduction in paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(A) of this section will be 10 percent, plus an additional 5 percent for each 3-month period (or fraction thereof) during which the failure continues after the 90-day period has expired.
(C)
Limitation on reduction.
The amount of the reduction under paragraphs (k)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section for each failure to furnish information required under this section will not exceed the greater of $10,000, or the gross income of the foreign partnership for its tax year with respect to which the failure occurred.
(D)
Offset for dollar amount penalty imposed.
The total amount of the reduction which, but for this paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(D), may be made under this paragraph (k)(3)(ii) with respect to any separate failure, may not exceed the maximum amount of the reductions that may be imposed, reduced (but not below zero) by the dollar amount penalty imposed by paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this section with respect to the failure.
(4)
Reasonable cause limitation.
The time prescribed for filing a complete Form 8865, and the beginning of the 90-day period after the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate mails notice under paragraphs (k)(3)(i)(B) and (ii)(B) of this section, will be treated as being not earlier than the last day on which reasonable cause existed for failure to furnish the information. The United States person may show reasonable cause by providing a written statement to the Commissioner's delegate having jurisdiction over the person's return to which the Form 8865 should have been attached, setting forth the reasons for the failure to comply. Whether a failure to comply was due to reasonable cause will be determined by the Commissioner, or the Commissioner's delegate, under all the facts and circumstances.
(5)
Statute of limitations.
For exceptions to the limitations on assessment in the event of a failure to provide information under section 6038, see section 6501(c)(8).
(l)
Applicability dates.
Except as otherwise provided, this section shall apply for tax years of a foreign partnership ending on or after December 31, 2000. For tax years of a foreign partnership ending before December 23, 2002,
see
§ 1.6038-3(j) in effect prior to the amendments made by T.D. 9033 (see 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2002). Paragraph (g)(3) of this section applies for taxable years of a foreign partnership beginning on or after December 20, 2018. Paragraph (g)(4) of this section applies for tax years of a foreign partnership beginning on or after March 4, 2019.
[T.D. 8850, 64 FR 72550, Dec. 28, 1999, as amended by T.D. 9033, 67 FR 78175, Dec. 23, 2002; T.D. 9065, 68 FR 39012, July 1, 2003; T.D. 9896, 85 FR 19857, Apr. 8, 2020; T.D. 9901, 85 FR 43116, July 15, 2020]
§ 1.6038-4
Information returns required of certain United States persons with respect to such person's U.S. multinational enterprise group.
(a)
Requirement of return.
Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, every ultimate parent entity of a U.S. multinational enterprise (MNE) group must make an annual return on Form 8975,
Country-by-Country Report,
setting forth the information described in paragraph (d) of this section, and any other information required by Form 8975, with respect to the reporting period described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Ultimate parent entity of a U.S. MNE group.
An ultimate parent entity of a U.S. MNE group is a U.S. business entity that:
(i) Owns directly or indirectly a sufficient interest in one or more other business entities, at least one of which is organized or tax resident in a tax jurisdiction other than the United States, such that the U.S. business entity is required to consolidate the accounts of the other business entities with its own accounts under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or would be so required if equity interests in the U.S. business entity were publicly traded on a U.S. securities exchange; and
(ii) Is not owned directly or indirectly by another business entity that consolidates the accounts of such U.S. business entity with its own accounts under generally accepted accounting principles in the other business entity's tax jurisdiction of residence, or would be so required if equity interests in the other business entity were traded on a public securities exchange in its tax jurisdiction of residence.
(2)
Business entity.
For purposes of this section, a business entity generally is any entity recognized for federal tax purposes that is not properly classified as a trust under § 301.7701-4 of this chapter. However, any grantor trust within the meaning of section 671, all or a portion of which is owned by a person other an individual, is a business entity for purposes of this section. Additionally, the term business entity includes any entity with a single owner that may be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner
under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter and a permanent establishment, as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, that prepares financial statements separate from those of its owner for financial reporting, regulatory, tax reporting, or internal management control purposes. A business entity does not include a decedent's estate or a bankruptcy estate described in section 1398.
(3)
Permanent establishment.
For purposes of this section, the term permanent establishment includes:
(i) A branch or business establishment of a constituent entity in a tax jurisdiction that is treated as a permanent establishment under an income tax convention to which that tax jurisdiction is a party;
(ii) A branch or business establishment of a constituent entity that is liable to tax in the tax jurisdiction in which it is located pursuant to the domestic law of such tax jurisdiction; or
(iii) A branch or business establishment of a constituent entity that is treated in the same manner for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner by the owner's tax jurisdiction of residence.
(4)
U.S. business entity.
A U.S. business entity is a business entity that is organized or has its tax jurisdiction of residence in the United States. For purposes of this section, foreign insurance companies that elect to be treated as domestic corporations under section 953(d) are U.S. business entities that have their tax jurisdiction of residence in the United States.
(5)
U.S. MNE group.
A U.S. MNE group comprises the ultimate parent entity of a U.S. MNE group as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and all of the business entities required to consolidate their accounts with the ultimate parent entity's accounts under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or that would be so required if equity interests in the ultimate parent entity were publicly traded on a U.S. securities exchange, regardless of whether any such business entities could be excluded from consolidation solely on size or materiality grounds.
(6)
Constituent entity.
With respect to a U.S. MNE group, a constituent entity is any separate business entity of such U.S. MNE group, except that the term constituent entity does not include a foreign corporation or foreign partnership for which the ultimate parent entity is not required to furnish information under section 6038(a) (determined without regard to §§ 1.6038-2(j) and 1.6038-3(c)) or any permanent establishment of such foreign corporation or foreign partnership.
(7)
Tax jurisdiction.
For purposes of this section, a tax jurisdiction is a country or a jurisdiction that is not a country but that has fiscal autonomy. For purposes of this section, a U.S. territory or possession of the United States is considered to have fiscal autonomy.
(8)
Tax jurisdiction of residence.
A business entity is considered a resident in a tax jurisdiction if, under the laws of that tax jurisdiction, the business entity is liable to tax therein based on place of management, place of organization, or another similar criterion. A business entity will not be considered a resident in a tax jurisdiction if the business entity is liable to tax in such tax jurisdiction only by reason of a tax imposed by reference to gross amounts of income without any reduction for expenses, provided such tax applies only with respect to income from sources in such tax jurisdiction or capital situated in such tax jurisdiction. If a business entity is resident in more than one tax jurisdiction, then the applicable income tax convention rules, if any, should be applied to determine the business entity's tax jurisdiction of residence. If a business entity is resident in more than one tax jurisdiction and no applicable income tax convention exists between those tax jurisdictions, or if the applicable income tax convention provides that the determination of residence is based on a determination by the competent authorities of the relevant tax jurisdictions and no such determination has been made, the business entity's tax jurisdiction of residence is the tax jurisdiction of the business entity's place of effective management determined in accordance with Article 4 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital 2014, or as provided by Form 8975. A corporation that is organized or managed in a
tax jurisdiction that does not impose an income tax on corporations will be treated as resident in that tax jurisdiction, unless such corporation is treated as resident in another tax jurisdiction under another provision of this section. The tax jurisdiction of residence of a permanent establishment is the jurisdiction in which the permanent establishment is located. If a business entity does not have a tax jurisdiction of residence, then solely for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the tax jurisdiction of residence is the business entity's country of organization.
(9)
Applicable financial statements.
An applicable financial statement is a certified audited financial statement that is accompanied by a report of an independent certified public accountant or similarly qualified independent professional that is used for purposes of reporting to shareholders, partners, or similar persons; for purposes of reporting to creditors in connection with securing or maintaining financing; or for any other substantial non-tax purpose.
(10)
U.S. territory or possession of the United States.
The term U.S. territory or possession of the United States means American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.
(11)
U.S. territory ultimate parent entity.
A U.S. territory ultimate parent entity is a business entity organized in a U.S. territory or possession of the United States that controls (as defined in section 6038(e)) a U.S. business entity and that is not owned directly or indirectly by another business entity that consolidates the accounts of the U.S. territory ultimate parent entity with its accounts under generally accepted accounting principles in the other business entity's tax jurisdiction of residence, or would be so required if equity interests in the other business entity were traded on a public securities exchange in its tax jurisdiction of residence.
(c)
Reporting period.
The reporting period covered by Form 8975 is the period of the ultimate parent entity's applicable financial statement prepared for the 12-month period (or a 52-53 week period described in section 441(f)) that ends with or within the ultimate parent entity's taxable year. If the ultimate parent entity does not prepare an annual applicable financial statement, then the reporting period covered by Form 8975 is the 12-month period (or a 52-53 week period described in section 441(f)) that ends on the last day of the ultimate parent entity's taxable year.
(d)
Contents of return
—(1)
Constituent entity information.
The return on Form 8975 must contain so much of the following information with respect to each constituent entity of the U.S. MNE group, and in such form or manner, as Form 8975 prescribes:
(i) The complete legal name of the constituent entity;
(ii) The tax jurisdiction, if any, in which the constituent entity is resident for tax purposes;
(iii) The tax jurisdiction in which the constituent entity is organized or incorporated (if different from the tax jurisdiction of residence);
(iv) The tax identification number, if any, used for the constituent entity by the tax administration of the constituent entity's tax jurisdiction of residence; and
(v) The main business activity or activities of the constituent entity.
(2)
Tax jurisdiction of residence information.
The return on Form 8975 must contain so much of the following information with respect to each tax jurisdiction in which one or more constituent entities of a U.S. MNE group is resident, presented as an aggregate of the information for the constituent entities resident in each tax jurisdiction, and in such form or manner, as Form 8975 prescribes:
(i) Revenues generated from transactions with other constituent entities;
(ii) Revenues not generated from transactions with other constituent entities;
(iii) Profit or loss before income tax;
(iv) Total income tax paid on a cash basis to all tax jurisdictions, and any taxes withheld on payments received by the constituent entities;
(v) Total accrued tax expense recorded on taxable profits or losses, reflecting only operations in the relevant annual period and excluding deferred taxes or provisions for uncertain tax liabilities;
(vi) Stated capital, except that the stated capital of a permanent establishment must be reported in the tax jurisdiction of residence of the legal entity of which it is a permanent establishment unless there is a defined capital requirement in the permanent establishment tax jurisdiction for regulatory purposes;
(vii) Total accumulated earnings, except that accumulated earnings of a permanent establishment must be reported by the legal entity of which it is a permanent establishment;
(viii) Total number of employees on a full-time equivalent basis; and
(ix) Net book value of tangible assets, which, for purposes of this section, does not include cash or cash equivalents, intangibles, or financial assets.
(3)
Special rules
—(i)
Constituent entity with no tax jurisdiction of residence.
The information listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section also must be provided, in the aggregate, for any constituent entity or entities that have no tax jurisdiction of residence. In addition, if a constituent entity is an owner of a constituent entity that does not have a jurisdiction of tax residence, then the owner's share of such entity's revenues and profits will be aggregated with the information for the owner's tax jurisdiction of residence.
(ii)
Definition of revenue.
For purposes of this section, the term revenue includes all amounts of revenue, including revenue from sales of inventory and property, services, royalties, interest, and premiums. The term revenue does not include payments received from other constituent entities that are treated as dividends in the payor's tax jurisdiction of residence. Distributions and remittances from partnerships and other fiscally transparent entities and permanent establishments that are constituent entities are not considered revenue of the recipient-owner. The term revenue also does not include imputed earnings or deemed dividends received from other constituent entities that are taken into account solely for tax purposes and that otherwise would be included as revenue by a constituent entity. With respect to a constituent entity that is an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) because it is an organization described in section 501(c), 501(d), or 401(a), a state college or university described in section 511(a)(2)(B), a plan described in section 403(b) or 457(b), an individual retirement plan or annuity as defined in section 7701(a)(37), a qualified tuition program described in section 529, a qualified ABLE program described in section 529A, or a Coverdell education savings account described in section 530, the term revenue includes only revenue that is reflected in unrelated business taxable income as defined in section 512.
(iii)
Number of employees.
For purposes of this section, the number of employees on a full-time equivalent basis may be reported as of the end of the accounting period, on the basis of average employment levels for the annual accounting period, or on any other reasonable basis consistently applied across tax jurisdictions and from year to year. Independent contractors participating in the ordinary operating activities of a constituent entity may be reported as employees of such constituent entity. Reasonable rounding or approximation of the number of employees is permissible, provided that such rounding or approximation does not materially distort the relative distribution of employees across the various tax jurisdictions. Consistent approaches should be applied from year to year and across entities.
(iv)
Income tax paid and accrued tax expense of permanent establishment.
In the case of a constituent entity that is a permanent establishment, the amount of income tax paid and the amount of accrued tax expense referred to in paragraphs (d)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section should not include the income tax paid or tax expense accrued by the business entity of which the permanent establishment would be a part, but for the third sentence of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in that business entity's tax jurisdiction of residence on the income derived by the permanent establishment.
(v)
Certain transportation income.
If a constituent entity of a U.S. MNE group derives income from international transportation or transportation in inland waterways that is covered by income tax convention provisions that are specific to such income and under
which the taxing rights on such income are allocated exclusively to one tax jurisdiction, then the U.S. MNE group should report the information required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to such income for the tax jurisdiction to which the relevant income tax convention provisions allocate these taxing rights.
(e)
Reporting of financial amounts
—(1)
Reporting in U.S. dollars required.
All amounts furnished under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, other than paragraph (d)(2)(viii) of this section, must be expressed in U.S. dollars. If an exchange rate is used other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for conversion to U.S. dollars, the exchange rate must be indicated.
(2)
Sources of financial amounts.
All amounts furnished under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, other than paragraph (d)(2)(viii) of this section, should be based on applicable financial statements, books and records maintained with respect to the constituent entity, regulatory financial statements, or records used for tax reporting or internal management control purposes for an annual period of each constituent entity ending with or within the period described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(f)
Time and manner for filing.
Returns on Form 8975 required under paragraph (a) of this section for a reporting period must be filed with the ultimate parent entity's income tax return for the taxable year, in or with which the reporting period ends, on or before the due date (including extensions) for filing that person's income tax return or as otherwise prescribed by Form 8975.
(g)
Maintenance of records.
The U.S. person filing Form 8975 as an ultimate parent entity of a U.S. MNE group must maintain records to support the information provided on Form 8975. However, the U.S. person is not required to create and maintain records that reconcile the amounts provided on Form 8975 with the tax returns of any tax jurisdiction or applicable financial statements.
(h)
Exceptions to furnishing information.
An ultimate parent entity of a U.S. MNE group is not required to report information under this section for the reporting period described in paragraph (c) of this section if the annual revenue of the U.S. MNE group for the immediately preceding reporting period was less than $850,000,000.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
U.S. territories and possessions of the United States.
A U.S. territory ultimate parent entity may designate a U.S. business entity that it controls (as defined in section 6038(e)) to file Form 8975 on the U.S. territory ultimate parent entity's behalf with respect to such U.S. territory ultimate parent entity and the business entities that would be required to consolidate their accounts with such U.S. territory ultimate parent entity under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or would be so required if equity interests in the U.S. territory ultimate parent entity were publicly traded on a U.S. securities exchange.
(k)
Applicability dates.
The rules of this section apply to reporting periods of ultimate parent entities of U.S. MNE groups that begin on or after the first day of a taxable year of the ultimate parent entity that begins on or after June 30, 2016.

§ 1.6038A-1
General requirements and definitions.
(a)
Purpose and scope.
This section and §§ 1.6038A-2 through 1.6038A-7 provide rules for certain foreign-owned U.S. corporations and foreign corporations engaged in trade or business within the United States (reporting corporations) relating to information that must be furnished, records that must be maintained, and the authorization of the reporting corporation to act as agent for related foreign persons for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604 that must be executed. Section 6038A(a) and this section require that a reporting corporation furnish certain information annually and maintain certain records relating to transactions between the reporting corporation and certain related parties. This section also provides definitions of terms used in section 6038A. Section 1.6038A-2 provides guidance concerning the information to be submitted and the filing of the required return. Section 1.6038A-3 provides guidance concerning the maintenance of records. Section 1.6038A-4 provides guidance concerning the application of the monetary penalty for the failure either to furnish information or to maintain records. Section 1.6038A-5 provides guidance concerning the authorization of an agent for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604. Section 1.6038A-6 provides guidance concerning the failure to furnish information requested by a summons. Finally, § 1.6038A-7 provides guidance concerning the application of the noncompliance penalty for failure by the related party to authorize an agent or by the reporting corporation to substantially comply with a summons.
(b)
In general.
A reporting corporation must furnish the information described in § 1.6038A-2 by filing an annual information return (Form 5472 or any successor), and must maintain records as described in § 1.6038A-3.
(c)
Reporting corporation
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 6038A, a reporting corporation is either a domestic corporation that is 25-percent foreign-owned as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, or a foreign corporation that is 25-percent foreign-owned and engaged in trade or business within the United States. After November 4, 1990, a foreign corporation engaged in a trade or business within the United States at any time during a taxable year is a reporting corporation. See section 6038C. A domestic business entity that is wholly owned by one foreign person and that is otherwise classified under § 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter as disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is treated as an entity separate from its owner and classified as a domestic corporation for purposes of section 6038A.
See
§ 301.7701-2(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter.
(2)
25-percent foreign-owned.
A corporation is 25-percent foreign-owned if it has at least one direct or indirect 25-percent foreign shareholder at any time during the taxable year.
(3)
25-percent foreign shareholder
—(i)
In general.
A foreign person is a 25-percent foreign shareholder of a corporation if the person owns at least 25 percent of—
(A) The total voting power of all classes of stock of the corporation entitled to vote, or
(B) The total value of all classes of stock of the corporation.
(ii)
Total voting power and value.
In determining whether one foreign person owns 25 percent of the total voting power of all classes of stock of a corporation entitled to vote or 25 percent of the total value of all classes of stock of a corporation, consideration will be given to all the facts and circumstances of each case, under principles similar to § 1.957-1(b)(2) (consideration of arrangements to shift formal voting power away from a foreign person).
(iii)
Direct 25-percent foreign shareholder.
A foreign person is a direct 25-percent foreign shareholder if it owns directly at least 25 percent of the stock of the reporting corporation, either by vote or by value.
(iv)
Indirect 25-percent foreign shareholder.
A foreign person is an indirect 25-percent foreign shareholder if it owns indirectly (or under the attribution rules of section 318 is considered to own indirectly) at least 25 percent of the stock of the reporting corporation, either by vote or by value.
(4)
Application to prior open years.
For taxable years beginning before July 11, 1989, the definition of a reporting corporation under this paragraph applies in determining whether a foreign-owned corporation is a reporting corporation. An examination may be reopened if the statute of limitations period for that taxable year has not expired. A taxable year may not be reopened under section 6038A for examination purposes if the taxable year is open under section 6511 only for purposes of the carryback of net operating losses or net capital losses.
(5)
Exceptions
—(i)
Treaty country residents having no permanent establishment.
A foreign corporation that has no permanent establishment in the United States under an applicable income tax convention is not a reporting corporation for purposes of section 6038A and this section. Accordingly, such a foreign corporation is not subject to §§ 1.6038A-2, 1.6038A-3, and 1.6038A-5. It must timely and fully provide the required notice to the Commissioner under section 6114. See section 6114 and the regulations thereunder for the notice that such a corporation must file and the applicable penalties for failure to file such notice.
(ii)
Qualified exempt shipping income.
A foreign corporation whose gross income is exempt from U.S. taxation under section 883 is not a reporting corporation provided that it timely and fully complies with the reporting requirements required to claim such exemption. In the event that such a corporation does not timely and fully comply with the reporting requirements under sections 887 and 883, it will be a reporting corporation subject to section 6038A, including the application of the monetary penalty for failure to file required information.
(iii)
Status as foreign related party.
Nothing in this paragraph affects the determination of whether a person is a foreign related party as defined in paragraph (g) of this section.
(d)
Related party.
The term “related party” means—
(1) Any direct or indirect 25-percent foreign shareholder of the reporting corporation,
(2) Any person who is related within the meaning of sections 267(b) or 707(b)(1) to the reporting corporation or to a 25-percent foreign shareholder of the reporting corporation, or
(3) Any other person who is related to the reporting corporation within the meaning of section 482 and the regulations thereunder. However, the term “related party” does not include any corporation filing a consolidated federal income tax return with the reporting corporation.
(e)
Attribution rules
—(1)
Attribution under section 318.
For purposes of determining whether a corporation is 25-percent foreign-owned and whether a person is a related party under section 6038A, the constructive ownership rules of section 318 shall apply, and the attribution rules of section 267(c) also shall apply to the extent they attribute ownership to persons to whom section 318 does not attribute ownership. However, “10 percent” shall be substituted for “50 percent” in section 318(a)(2)(C), and section 318(a)(3) (A), (B), and (C) shall not be applied so as to consider a U.S. person as owning stock that is owned by a person who is not a U.S. person. Additionally, section 318(a)(3)(C) and § 1.318-1(b) shall not be applied so as to consider a U.S. corporation as being a reporting corporation if, but for the application of such sections, the U.S. corporation would not be 25-percent foreign owned.
(2)
Attribution of transactions with related parties engaged in by a partnership.
The transactions in which a domestic or foreign partnership engages shall be attributed to any reporting corporation whose interest in the capital or profits of the partnership, either directly or indirectly, combined with the interests of all related parties of the reporting corporation partner, equals 25 percent or more of the total partnership interests. Attribution of such transactions shall be made only to the extent of the partnership interest held by that reporting corporation partner. See sections 875 and 702(a) and the regulations thereunder. (Attribution shall not be made however, of transactions directly between the partnership and a reporting corporation.) Accordingly, a reporting corporation partner that is deemed to engage in transactions with related parties under this rule is subject to the information reporting requirements of § 1.6038A-2, to the record maintenance requirements of § 1.6038A-3, to the monetary penalty under § 1.6038A-4, to the requirement of authorization of agent under § 1.6038A-5, to the rules of § 1.6038A-6 relating to the requirement to produce records, and to the noncompliance penalty adjustment under § 1.6038A-7.
(f)
Foreign person.
For purposes of section 6038A, a foreign person is—
(1) Any individual who is not a citizen or resident of the United States, but not including any individual for whom an election under section 6013 (g) or (h) (relating to an election to file a joint return) is in effect;
(2) Any individual who is a citizen of any possession of the United States and who is not otherwise a citizen or resident of the United States;
(3) Any partnership, association, company, or corporation that is not created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or any State thereof;
(4) Any foreign trust or foreign estate, as defined in section 7701(a)(31); or
(5) Any foreign government (or agency or instrumentality thereof). To the extent that a foreign government is engaged in the conduct of commercial activity as defined under section 892 and the regulations thereunder, it will be treated as a foreign person under section 6038A and this section only for purposes of the information reporting requirements of § 1.6038A-2. A foreign government will not be treated as a foreign related party for purposes of §§ 1.6038A-3 and 1.6038A-5.
For purposes of section 6038A, a possession of the United States shall be considered to be a foreign country.
(g)
Foreign related party.
A foreign related party is a foreign person as defined under paragraph (f) of this section that is also a related party as defined under paragraph (d) of this section.
(h)
Small corporation exception.
A reporting corporation (other than an entity that is a reporting corporation as a result of being treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter) that has less than $10,000,000 in U.S. gross receipts for a taxable year is not subject to §§ 1.6038A-3 and 1.6038A-5 for that taxable year. Such a corporation, however, remains subject to the information reporting requirements of § 1.6038A-2 and the general record maintenance requirements of section 6001. For purposes of this paragraph, U.S. gross receipts includes all amounts received or accrued to the extent that such amounts are taken into account for the determination and computation of the gross income of the corporation. For purposes of this test, the U.S. gross receipts of all related reporting corporations shall be aggregated.
(i)
Safe harbor for reporting corporations with related party transactions of de minimis value
—(1)
In general.
A reporting corporation (other than an entity that is a reporting corporation as a result of being treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter) is not subject to §§ 1.6038A-3 and 1.6038A-5 for any taxable year in which the aggregate value of all gross payments it makes to and receives from foreign related parties with respect to related party transactions (including monetary consideration, nonmonetary consideration, and the value of transactions involving less than full consideration) is not more than $5,000,000 and is less than 10 percent of its U.S. gross income. Such a corporation, however, remains subject to the information reporting requirements of § 1.6038A-2 and the general record maintenance requirements of section 6001. For purposes of this paragraph, U.S. gross income means the gross income reportable by the reporting corporation (or the aggregate gross income reportable by all related reporting corporations) for U.S. income tax purposes. Gross payments made to or received from foreign related parties cannot be netted; rather, the gross payments made to and received from foreign related parties are to be aggregated. Thus, for example, if a reporting corporation receives $4,700,000 of gross payments from a related party and makes $500,000 of gross payments to the same related party, it has aggregate gross payments of $5,200,000, and, therefore, does not qualify for the safe harbor under this paragraph.
(2)
Aggregate value of gross payments made or received.
The aggregate value of gross payments made to (or received from) a foreign related party with respect to foreign related party transactions is determined by totaling the dollar amounts of foreign related party transactions as described in § 1.6038A-2(b) (3) and (4) on all Forms 5472 filed by the reporting corporation or related reporting corporations.
(j)
Related reporting corporations.
A reporting corporation is related to another reporting corporation if it is related to that other reporting corporation under the principles described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
(k)
Consolidated return groups
—(1)
Required information.
If a reporting corporation is a member of an affiliated group for which a U.S. consolidated income tax return is filed, the return requirement of § 1.6038A-2 may be satisfied by filing a consolidated Form 5472. The common parent, as identified on Form 851, must attach a schedule to the consolidated Form 5472 stating which members of the U.S. affiliated group are reporting corporations under section 6038A, and which of those are joining in the consolidated Form 5472. The schedule must provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each member whose transactions are included on the consolidated Form 5472. A member is not required to join in filing a consolidated Form 5472 merely because other members of the group choose to file one or more Forms 5472 on a consolidated basis.
(2)
Maintenance of records and authorization of agent.
Either the common parent or the principal operating company of an affiliated group filing a consolidated income tax return may be authorized under § 1.6038A-5 to act as the agent for foreign related persons engaged in transactions with members of the group solely for purposes of section 7602, 7603, and 7604 under section
6038A(e)(1) and § 1.6038A-5. Each member of the group, however, must maintain the records required under section 6038A (a) and § 1.6038A-3 relating to its related party transactions.
(3)
Monetary penalties.
The common parent (or principal operating company) and all reporting corporations that join in the filing of a consolidated Form 5472 are liable jointly and severally for penalties for failure to file Form 5472 and for failure to mantain records under section 6038A(d) and § 1.6038A-4(e). See § 1.1502-77(a) regarding the scope of agency of the common parent corporation.
(l)
District Director.
For purposes of the regulations under section 6038A, the term “District Director” means any District Director, or the Assistant Commissioner (International) when performing duties similar to those of a District Director with respect to any person over which the Assistant Commissioner (International) has appropriate jurisdiction.
(m)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.

# Example 1.
P, a U.S. partnership that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, is 75 percent owned by FC1, a foreign corporation that, in turn, is wholly owned by another foreign corporation, FC2. The remaining 25 percent of P is owned by Corp, a domestic corporation, that is wholly owned by FC3. P engages in transactions solely with FC2 and FC3. These transactions are attributed to FC1 and Corp. Under section 875, FC1 is considered as being engaged in a U.S. trade or business. For purposes of section 6038A and this section, FC1 and Corp are reporting corporations and must report their pro rata shares of the value of the transactions with FC2 and FC3. Thus, Corp must report 25 percent of P's transactions with FC3 and FC1 must report 75 percent of P's transactions with FC2.

# Example 2.
FC2 and FC3 are both foreign corporations that are wholly owned by FC1, also a foreign corporation. FC2 engages in a trade or business in the United States through a branch. The branch engages in related party transactions with FC1. FC2 is a reporting corporation. FC3 is a foreign related party. FC1 is a direct 25-percent foreign shareholder of both FC2 and FC3. Neither FC1 nor FC3 is a reporting corporation.

# Example 3.
FC1 owns 25 percent of total voting power in each of FC2 and FC3. FC2 and FC3 each own 20 percent of the total voting power of Corp, a domestic corporation. The remaining stock of Corp is owned by an unrelated domestic corporation. Neither FC2 nor FC3 is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. Under section 318(a)(2)(C) and paragraph (e) of this section, FC1 constructively owns its proportionate share of the stock of Corp owned directly by FC2 and FC3. Thus, FCl is treated as constructively owning five percent of Corp through each of FC2 and FC3 or a total of 10 percent of the Corp stock. Consequently, Corp is not a reporting corporation because no 25 percent shareholder exists.

# Example 4.
FP owns 100 percent of FCl which, in turn, owns 100 percent of FC2. FC2 owns 100 percent of FC3 which owns 100 percent of RC. FP, FC1, and FC2 are indirect 25-percent foreign shareholders of RC, and FC3 is a direct 25-percent foreign shareholder.

# Example 5.
FP owns 100 percent of USS, a U.S. corporation, and 25 percent of FS, a foreign corporation. The remaining 75 percent of FS is publicly owned by numerous small shareholders. Sales transactions occur between USS and FS. Applying the rules of this section, USS is a reporting corporation. It is determined that USS and FS are each controlled by FP under section 482 and the regulations thereunder. Therefore, FS is related to USS within the meaning of section 482 and is a related party to USS. Accordingly, the sales transactions between USS and FS are subject to section 6038A.

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in
Example 5,
except that the remaining 75 percent of FS is owned by one shareholder that is unrelated to the FP group and it is determined that FS is not controlled by FP for purposes of section 482. Under these facts, FS is not a related party of either FP or USS. Accordingly, section 6038A does not apply to the sales transactions between FS and USS.

# Example 7.
P, a U.S. multinational, is a holding company that wholly owns X, a U.S. operating company, which in turn wholly owns FS, a controlled foreign corporation. Applying the rule of section 318(a)(3)(C), FS is deemed to own the stock of X that is actually held by P. However, under the rules of paragraph (e) of this section, X will not be a reporting corporation by reason of section 318.

Requirement of return.
(a)
Forms required
—(1)
Form 5472.
Each reporting corporation as defined in § 1.6038A-1(c) (or members of an affiliated group filing together as described in § 1.6038A-1(k)) shall make a separate annual information return on Form 5472 with respect to each related party as defined in § 1.6038A-1(d) with which the reporting corporation (or any group member joining in a consolidated Form 5472) has had any reportable transaction during the taxable year. The information required by section 6038A and this section must be furnished even though it may not affect the amount of any tax due under the Code.
(2)
Reportable transaction.
A reportable transaction is any transaction of the types listed in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, and, in the case of a reporting corporation that is an applicable taxpayer, as defined under § 1.59A-2(b), any other arrangement that, to prevent avoidance of the purposes of section 59A, is identified on Form 5472 as a reportable transaction. However, except as the Secretary may prescribe otherwise for an applicable taxpayer, the transaction is not a reportable transaction if neither party to
the transaction is a United States person as defined in section 7701(a)(30) (which, for purposes of section 6038A, includes an entity that is a reporting corporation as a result of being treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter) and the transaction—
(i) Will not generate in any taxable year gross income from sources within the United States or income effectively connected, or treated as effectively connected, with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, and
(ii) Will not generate in any taxable year any expense, loss, or other deduction that is allocable or apportionable to such income.
(3)
Form 8991.
Each reporting corporation that is an applicable taxpayer, as defined under § 1.59A-2(b), must make an annual information return on Form 8991. The obligation of an applicable taxpayer to report on Form 8991 does not depend on applicability of tax under section 59A or obligation to file Form 5472.
(b)

If the related party is a foreign person, the reporting corporation must set forth on Form 5472 the dollar amounts of all reportable transactions for which monetary consideration (including U.S. and foreign currency) was the sole consideration paid or received during the taxable year of the reporting corporation. The total amount of such transactions, as well as the separate amounts for each type of transaction described below, and, to the extent the form may prescribe, any further description, categorization, or listing of transactions within these types, must be reported on Form 5472, in the manner the form or its instructions may prescribe. Where actual
amounts are not determinable, a reasonable estimate (as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section) is permitted. The types of transactions described in this paragraph are:

If the related party is a foreign person, the reporting corporation must provide on Form 5472 a description of any reportable transaction, or group of reportable transactions, listed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for which any part of the consideration paid or received was not monetary consideration, or for which less than full consideration was paid or received. A description required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall include sufficient information from which to determine the nature and approximate monetary value of the transaction or group of transactions, and shall include:
(i) A description of all property (including monetary consideration), rights, or obligations transferred from the reporting corporation to the foreign related party and from the foreign related party to the reporting corporation;
(ii) A description of all services performed by the reporting corporation for the foreign related party and by the foreign related party for the reporting corporation; and
(iii) A reasonable estimate of the fair market value of all properties and services exchanged, if possible, or some other reasonable indicator of value.
If, for any transaction, the entire consideration received includes both tangible and intangible property and the consideration paid is solely monetary consideration, the transaction should be reported under paragraph (b)(3) of this section if the intangible property was related and incidental to the transfer of the tangible property (for example, a right to warranty services.)
(5)
Additional information.
In addition to the information required under paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section, a reporting corporation must provide on Form 5472, in the manner the form prescribes, the following information:
(i) If the reporting corporation imports goods from a foreign related party, whether the costs taken into account in computing the basis or inventory cost of such goods are greater than the costs taken into account in computing the valuation of the goods
for customs purposes, adjusted pursuant to section 1059A and the regulations thereunder, and if so, the reasons for the difference.
(ii) If the costs taken into account in computing the basis or inventory cost of such goods are greater than the costs taken into account in computing the valuation of the goods for customs purposes, whether the documents supporting the reporting corporation's treatment of the items set forth in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section are in existence and available in the United States at the time Form 5472 is filed.
(iii) If, for the taxable year, a reporting corporation pays or accrues interest or royalties for which a deduction is disallowed under section 267A and the regulations in this part under section 267A, then the reporting corporation must provide such information about the disallowance in the form and manner and to the extent prescribed by Form 5472 (or successor form), instruction, publication, or other guidance.
(iv) If, for the taxable year, the reporting corporation has a deduction under section 250 (by reason of having foreign-derived intangible income) with respect to any amount required to be reported under paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section, the reporting corporation will provide on Form 5472 (or any successor form) such information about the deduction in the form and manner and to the extent prescribed by Form 5472 (or any successor form), instructions to the form, publication, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(6)
Compilation of reportable transactions across multiple related parties.
A reporting corporation must, to the extent and in the manner Form 5472 or its instructions may prescribe, include a schedule tabulating information with respect to related parties for which the reporting corporation is required to file Forms 5472. The schedule will not require information (beyond totaling) that is not required for the individual Forms 5472. The schedule may include the following:
(i) The identity and status of the related parties;
(ii) The reporting corporation's relationship to the related parties;
(iii) The reporting corporation's reportable transactions with the related parties; and
(iv) Other items required to be reported on Form 5472.
(7)
Information on Form 5472 and Form 8991 regarding base erosion payments.
If any reporting corporation is an applicable taxpayer, as defined under § 1.59A-2(b), it must report the information required by Form 8991 and by any Form 5472 it is required to file (including the information required by their accompanying instructions), regarding:
(i) Determination of whether a taxpayer is an applicable taxpayer;
(ii) Computation of base erosion minimum tax amount, including computation of regular tax liability as adjusted for purposes of computing base erosion minimum tax amount;
(iii) Computation of modified taxable income;

(A) The aggregate amount of qualified derivative payments for the taxable year; and
(B) A representation that all payments satisfy the requirements of § 1.59A-6(b)(2); and
(x) Any other information necessary to carry out section 59A.
(8)
Reasonable estimate
—(i)
Estimate within 25 percent of actual amount.
Any amount reported under this section is considered to be a reasonable estimate if it is at least 75 percent and not more than 125 percent of the actual amount.
(ii)
Other estimates.
If any amount reported under this paragraph (b) of this section fails to meet the reasonable estimate test of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, the reporting corporation nevertheless may show that such amount is a reasonable estimate by making an affirmative showing of relevant facts
and circumstances in a written statement containing a declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury. The District Director shall determine whether the amount reported was a reasonable estimate.
(9)
Small amounts.
If any actual amount required under this section does not exceed $50,000, the amount may be reported as “$50,000 or less.”
(10)
Accrued payments and receipts.
For purposes of this section, a reporting corporation that uses an accrual method of accounting shall use accrued payments and accrued receipts for purposes of computing the total amount of each of the types of transactions listed in this section.
(11)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (b)(3) of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) In year 1, W, a foreign corporation, forms and contributes assets to X, a domestic limited liability company that does not elect to be treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-3(c) of this chapter. In year 2, W contributes funds to X. In year 3, X makes a payment to W. In year 4, X, in liquidation, distributes its assets to W.
(ii) In accordance with § 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter, X is disregarded as an entity separate from W. In accordance with § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter, X is treated as an entity separate from W and classified as a domestic corporation for purposes of section 6038A. In accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, each of the transactions in years 1 through 4 is a reportable transaction with respect to X. Therefore, X has a section 6038A reporting and record maintenance requirement for each of those years.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of this paragraph (b)(9) except that, in year 1, W also forms and contributes assets to Y, another domestic limited liability company that does not elect to be treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-3(c) of this chapter. In year 1, X and Y form and contribute assets to Z, another domestic limited liability company that does not elect to be treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-3(c) of this chapter. In year 2, X transfers funds to Z. In year 3, Z makes a payment to Y. In year 4, Z distributes its assets to X and Y in liquidation.
(ii) In accordance with § 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter, Y and Z are disregarded as entities separate from each other, W, and X. In accordance with § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter, Y, Z and X are treated as entities separate from each other and W, and are classified as domestic corporations for purposes of section 6038A. In accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, each of the transactions in years 1 through 4 involving Z is a reportable transaction with respect to Z. Similarly, W's contribution to Y and Y's contribution to Z in year 1, the payment to Y in year 3, and the distribution to Y in year 4 are reportable transactions with respect to Y. Moreover, X's contribution to Z in Year 1, X's funds transfer to Z in year 2, and the distribution to X in year 4 are reportable transactions with respect to X. Therefore, Z has a section 6038A reporting and record maintenance requirement for years 1 through 4; Y has a section 6038A reporting and record maintenance requirement for years 1, 3, and 4; and X has a section 6038A reporting and record maintenance requirement in years 1, 2, and 4 in addition to its section 6038A reporting and record maintenance described in
Example 1
of this paragraph (b)(9).
(c)
Method of reporting.
All statements required on or with the Form 5472 or Form 8991 under this section and § 1.6038A-5 must be in the English language. All amounts required to be reported under paragraph (b) of this section must be expressed in United States currency, with a statement of the exchange rates used, and, to the extent the forms may require, must indicate the method by which the amount of a reportable transaction or item was determined.
(d)
Time for filing returns.
A Form 5472 and Form 8991 required under this section must be filed with the reporting corporation's income tax return for the taxable year by the due date (including extensions) of that return. In the case of an entity that is a reporting corporation as a result of being treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter, Form 5472 must be filed at such time and in such manner as the Commissioner may prescribe in forms or instructions.
(e)
Exceptions
—(1)
No reportable transactions.
A reporting corporation is not required to file Form 5472 if it has no transactions of the types listed in paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section during the taxable year with any related party.
(2)
Transactions solely with a domestic reporting corporation.
If all of a foreign reporting corporation's reportable transactions are with one or more related domestic reporting corporations that are not members of the same affiliated group, the foreign reporting corporation shall furnish on Form 5472
only the information required under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, if the domestic reporting corporations provide the information required under paragraphs (b) (3) through (5) of this section. Such a foreign reporting corporation nonetheless is subject to the record maintenance requirements of § 1.6038A-3 and the requirements of §§ 1.6038A-5 and 1.6038A-6. The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each domestic reporting corporation that provided such information must be indicated on Form 5472 in the space provided for the information under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section.
(3)
Transactions with a corporation subject to reporting under section 6038.
A reporting corporation (other than an entity that is a reporting corporation as a result of being treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter) is not required to make a return of information on Form 5472 with respect to a related foreign corporation for a taxable year for which a U.S. person that controls the foreign related corporation makes a return of information on Form 5471 that is required under section 6038 and this section, if that return contains information required under § 1.6038-2(f)(11) with respect to the reportable transactions between the reporting corporation and the related corporation for that taxable year. Such a reporting corporation also is not subject to §§ 1.6038A-3 and 1.6038A-5. It remains subject to the general record maintenance requirements of section 6001.
(4)
Transactions with a foreign sales corporation.
A reporting corporation (other than an entity that is a reporting corporation as a result of being treated as a corporation under § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter) is not required to make a return of information on Form 5472 with respect to a related corporation that qualifies as a foreign sales corporation for a taxable year for which the foreign sales corporation files Form 1120-FSC.
(f)
Filing Form 5472 when transactions with related parties engaged in by a partnership are attributed to a reporting corporation.
If transactions engaged in by a partnership are attributed under § 1.6038A-1(e)(2) to a reporting corporation, the reporting corporation need report on Form 5472 only the percentage of the value of the transaction or transactions equal to the percentage of its partnership interest. Thus, for example, if a partnership buys $1000 of widgets from the foreign parent of a reporting corporation whose partnership interest in the partnership equals 50 percent of the partnership interests (and the remaining 50 percent is held by unrelated parties), the reporting corporation must report $500 of purchases from a foreign related party on Form 5472.
(g)
Effective/applicability date.
Except as otherwise provided, for applicability dates for this section for certain reporting corporations, see § 1.6038A-1(n). Paragraph (b)(10) of this section applies with respect to information for annual accounting periods beginning on or after June 21, 2006. Paragraph (b)(7)(ix) of this section applies to taxable years beginning on or after June 7, 2021. Before these final regulations are applicable, a taxpayer will be treated as satisfying the reporting requirement described in § 1.59A-6(b)(2) only to the extent that it reports the aggregate amount of qualified derivative payments on Form 8991.
See
§ 1.59A-6(b)(2)(iv) (transition period for qualified derivative payment reporting). Paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section applies with respect to information for annual accounting periods beginning on or after December 20, 2018. Paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section applies with respect to information for annual accounting periods beginning on or after March 4, 2019.

§ 1.6038A-3
Record maintenance.
(a)
General maintenance requirements
—(1) Section 6001 and section 6038A. A reporting corporation must keep the permanent books of account or records as
required by section 6001 that are sufficient to establish the correctness of the federal income tax return of the corporation, including information, documents, or records (“records”) to the extent they may be relevant to determine the correct U.S. tax treatment of transactions with related parties. Under section 6001, the District Director may require any person to make such returns, render such statements, or keep such specific records as will enable the District Director to determine whether or not that person is liable for any of the taxes to which the regulations under part I have application. See section 6001 and the regulations thereunder. Such records must be permanent, accurate, and complete, and must clearly establish income, deductions, and credits. Additionally, in appropriate cases, such records include sufficient relevant cost data from which a profit and loss statement may be prepared for products or services transferred between a reporting corporation and its foreign related parties. This requirement includes records of the reporting corporation itself, as well as to records of any foreign related party that may be relevant to determine the correct U.S. tax treatment of transactions between the reporting corporation and foreign related parties. The relevance of such records with respect to related party transactions shall be determined upon the basis of all the facts and circumstances. Section 6038A and this section provide detailed guidance regarding the required maintenance of records with respect to such transactions and specify penalties for noncompliance. Banks and other financial institutions shall follow the specific record maintenance rules described in paragraph (h) of this section.
(2)
Safe harbor.
A safe harbor for record maintenance is provided under paragraph (c) of this section, which sets forth detailed guidance concerning the types of records to be maintained with respect to related party transactions. The safe harbor consists of an all-inclusive list of record types that could be relevant to different taxpayers under a variety of facts and circumstances. It does not constitute a checklist of records that every reporting corporation must maintain or that generally should be requested by the Service. A specific reporting corporation is required to maintain, and the Service will request, only those records enumerated in the safe harbor (including material profit and loss statements) that may be relevant to its business or industry and to the correct U.S. tax treatment of its transactions with its foreign related parties. Accordingly, not every item listed in the safe harbor must be maintained by every reporting corporation. A corporation that maintains or causes another person to maintain the records listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section that may be relevant to its foreign related party transactions and to its business or industry will be deemed to have met the record maintenance requirements of section 6038A.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph.

# Example 1.
RC, a U.S. reporting corporation, is owned by two shareholders, F and P. F is a foreign corporation that owns 30 percent of the stock of RC. P is a domestic corporation that owns the remaining 70 percent. RC purchases tangible property from F; however, the only potential audit issue with respect to these transactions is their treatment under section 482. It is determined that F does not in fact control RC and the two corporations do not constitute a group of “controlled taxpayers” for purposes of section 482 and the regulations thereunder. There are no other reportable transactions between RC and F. Under § 1.6038A-1(g), F is a foreign related party with respect to RC. Accordingly, RC is required to report its purchases of property from F under the reporting requirements of § 1.6038A-2. Nevertheless, because section 482 is not applicable to the transactions between RC and F, the records created by F with respect to its sales to RC are not relevant for purposes of determining the correct tax treatment of these transactions. RC is required to maintain its own records of these transactions under the requirements of section 6001, but the transactions are not subject to the record maintenance requirements of this section. If, however, on audit it is determined that F does control RC, all records relevant to determining the arm's length consideration for the tangible property under section 482 will be subject to these requirements.

# Example 2.
FP, a foreign person, owns 30 percent of the stock of RC, a reporting corporation. The remaining 70 percent of RC stock is held by persons that are not 25-percent foreign shareholders. It is determined that FP is related to RC within the meaning
of section 482 and the regulations thereunder. The only transactions between FP and RC are FP's capital contributions, dividends paid from RC to FP, and loans from FP to RC. Under section 6001, RC is required to maintain all documentation necessary to establish the U.S. tax treatment of the capital contributions, dividends, and loans. RC is not required to maintain records in other categories listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section because they are not relevant to the transactions between FP and RC. Records of FP not related to these transactions are not subject to the record maintenance requirements under section 6038A(a) and this section.

# Example 3.
G, a foreign multinational group, creates Sub, a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, in order to purchase tangible property from unrelated parties in the United States and resell such property to G. The property purchased by Sub is either used in G's business or resold to other unrelated parties by G. Sub's sole function is to act as a buyer for G and these purchases are the only transactions that G has with any U.S. affiliates. Under all the facts and circumstances of this case, it is determined that an analysis of the group's worldwide profit attributable to the property it purchases from Sub is not relevant for purposes of determining the tax treatment of the sales from Sub to G. Therefore, the records with respect to the profitability of G are not subject to the record maintenance requirements of this section. However, all records related to the appropriate method under section 482 for determining an arm's-length consideration for the property sold by Sub to G are subject to the record maintenance requirements of this section.

# Example 4.
S, a U.S. reporting corporation, provides computer consulting services for its foreign parent, X. Based on the application of section 482 and the regulations, it is determined that the cost of services plus method, as described in § 1.482-9(e), will provide the most reliable measure of an arm's length result, based on the facts and circumstances of the controlled transaction between S and X. S is required to maintain records to permit verification upon audit of the comparable transactional costs (as described in § 1.482-9(e)(2)(iii)) used to calculate the arm's length price. Based on the facts and circumstances, if it is determined that X's records are relevant to determine the correct U.S. tax treatment of the controlled transaction between S and X, the record maintenance requirements under section 6038A(a) and this section will be applicable to the records of X.
(b)
Other maintenance requirements
—(1)
Indirectly related records.
This section applies to records that are directly or indirectly related to transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related parties. An example of records that are indirectly related to such transactions is records possessed by a foreign subsidiary of a foreign related party that document the raw material or component costs of a product that is manufactured or assembled by the subsdiary and sold as a finished product by the foreign related party to the reporting corporation.
(2)
Foreign related party or third-party maintenance.
If records that are required to be maintained under this section are in the control of a foreign related party, the records may be obtained or compiled (if not already in the possession of the foreign related party or already compiled) under the direction of the reporting corporation and then maintained by the reporting corporation, the foreign related party, or a third party. Thus, for example, a foreign related party may either itself maintain such records outside the United States or permit a third party to maintain such records outside the United States, provided that the conditions described in paragraph (f) of this section are met. Upon a request for such records by the Service, a foreign related party or third party may make arrangements with the District Director to furnish the records directly, rather than through the reporting corporation.
(3)
Translation of records.
When records are provided to the Service under a request for production, any portion of such records must be translated into the English language within 30 days of a request for translation of that portion by the District Director. To the extent that any requested documents are identical to documents that have already been translated, an explanation of how such documents are identical instead may be provided. An extension of this time period may be requested under paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Appropriate extensions will be liberally granted for translation requests where circumstances warrant. If a good faith effort is made to translate accurately the requested documents within the specified time period, the reporting corporation will not be subject to the penalties in §§ 1.6038A-4 and 1.6038A-7.
(4)
Exception for foreign governments.
A foreign government is not subject to the obligation to maintain records under this section.
(5)
Records relating to conduit financing arrangements.
See § 1.881-4 relating to conduit financing arrangements.
(c)
Specific records to be maintained for safe harbor
—(1)
In general.
A reporting corporation that maintains or causes another person to maintain the records specified in this paragraph (c) that are relevant to its business or industry and to the correct U.S. tax treatment of its transactions with its foreign related parties will deemed to have met the record maintenance requirements of this section. This paragraph provides general descriptions of the categories of records to be maintained; the particular title or label applied by a reporting corporation or related party does not control. Functional equivalents of the specified documents are acceptable. Record maintenance in accordance with this safe harbor, however, requires only the maintenance of types of documents described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section that are directly or indirectly related to transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related party. Additionally, to the extent the reporting corporation establishes that records in a particular category are not applicable to the industry or business of the reporting corporation and any foreign related party, maintenance of such records is not required under this paragraph. Record maintenance in accordance with this paragraph (c) generally does not require the original creation of records that are ordinarily not created by the reporting corporation or its related parties. (If, however, a document that is actually created is described in this paragraph (c), it is to be maintained even if the document is not of the type ordinarily created by the reporting corporation or its related parties.) There are two exceptions to the rule. First, basic accounting records that are sufficient to document the U.S. tax effects of transactions between related parties must be created and retained, if they do not otherwise exist. Second, records sufficient to produce material profit and loss statements as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (3) of this section that are relevant for determining the U.S. tax treatment of transactions between the reporting corporation and foreign related parties must be created if such records are not ordinarily maintained. All internal records storage and retrieval systems used for each taxable year must be retained.
(2)
Descriptions of categories of documents to be maintained.
The following records must be maintained in order to satisfy this paragraph (c) to the extent they may be relevant to determine the correct U.S. tax treatment of transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related party.
(i)
Original entry books and transaction records.
This category includes books and records of original entry or their functional equivalents, however designated or labelled, that are relevant to transactions between any foreign related party and the reporting corporation. Examples include, but are not limited to, general ledgers, sales journals, purchase order books, cash receipts books, cash disbursement books, canceled checks and bank statements, workpapers, sales contracts, and purchase invoices. Descriptive material to explicate entries in the foregoing types of records, such as a chart of accounts or an accounting policy manual, is included in this category.
(ii)
Profit and loss statements.
This category includes records from which the reporting corporation can compile and supply, within a reasonable time, material profit and loss statements of the reporting corporation and all related parties as defined in § 1.6038A-1 (d) (the “related party group”) that reflect profit or loss of the related party group attributable to U.S.-connected products or services as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section. The determination of whether a profit and loss statement is material is made under the rules provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The material profit and loss statements described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) must reflect the consolidated revenue and expenses of all members of the related party group. Thus, records in this category include the documentation of the cost of raw materials used by a related party to manufacture finished goods that are
then sold by another related party to the reporting corporation. The records should be kept under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles if they are ordinarily maintained in such manner; if not, an explanation of the material differences between the accounting principles used and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles must be made available. The statements need not reflect tracing of the actual costs borne by the group with respect to its U.S.-connected products or services; rather, any reasonable method may be used to allocate the group's worldwide costs to the revenues generated by the sales of those products or services. An explanation of the methods used to allocate specific items to a particular profit and loss statement must be made available. The explanation of material differences between accounting principles and the explanation of allocation methods must be sufficient to permit a comparison of the profitability of the group to that of the reporting corporation attributable to the provision of U.S.-connected products or services.
(iii)
Pricing documents.
This category includes all documents relevant to establishing the appropriate price or rate for transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related party. Examples include, but are not limited to, documents related to transactions involving the same or similar products or services entered into by the reporting corporation or a foreign related party with related and unrelated parties; shipping and export documents; commission agreements; documents relating to production or assembly facilities; third-party and intercompany purchase invoices; manuals, specifications, and similar documents relating to or describing the performance of functions conducted at particular locations; intercompany correspondence discussing any instructions or assistance relating to such transactions provided to the reporting corporations by the related foreign person (or vice versa); intercompany and intracompany correspondence concerning the price or the negotiation of the price used in such transactions; documents related to the value and ownership of intangibles used or developed by the reporting corporation or the foreign related party; documents related to cost of goods sold and other expenses; and documents related to direct and indirect selling, and general and administrative expenses (for example, relating to advertising, sales promotions, or warranties).
(iv)
Foreign country and third party filings.
This category includes financial and other documents relevant to transactions between a reporting corporation and any foreign related party filed with or prepared for any foreign government entity, any independent commission, or any financial institution.
(v)
Ownership and capital structure records.
This category includes records or charts showing the relationship between the reporting corporation and the foreign related party; the location, ownership, and status (for example, joint venture, partnership, branch, or division) of all entities and offices directly or indirectly involved in the transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related party; a worldwide organization chart; records showing the management structure of all foreign affiliates; and loan documents, agreements, and other documents relating to any transfer of the stock of the reporting corporation that results in the change of the status of a foreign person as a foreign related party.
(vi)
Records of loans, services, and other non-sales transactions.
This category includes relevant documents relating to loans (including all deposits by one foreign related party or reporting corporation with an unrelated party and a subsequent loan by that unrelated party to a foreign related party or reporting corporation that is in substance a direct loan between a reporting corporation and a foreign related party); guarantees of a foreign related party of debts of the reporting corporation, and vice versa; hedging arrangements or other risk shifting or currency risk shifting arrangements involving the reporting corporation and any foreign related party; security agreements between the reporting corporation and any foreign related party; research and development expense allocations between any foreign related party and the reporting corporation;
service transactions between any foreign related party and the reporting corporation, including, for example, a description of the allocation of charges for management services, time or travel records, or allocation studies; import and export transactions between a reporting corporation and any foreign related party; the registration of patents and copyrights with respect to transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related party: and documents regarding lawsuits in foreign countries that relate to such transactions between a reporting corporation and any foreign related party (for example, product liability suits for U.S. products).
(vii)
Records relating to conduit financing arrangements.
See § 1.881-4 relating to conduit financing arrangements.
(3)
Material profit and loss statements.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the determination of whether a profit and loss statement is material will be made according to the following rules. An agreement between the reporting corporation and the District Director as described in paragraph (e) of this section may identify material profit and loss statements of the related party group and describe the items to be included in any profit and loss statements for which records are to be maintained to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. In the absence of such an agreement, a profit and loss statement will be material if it meets any of the following tests: the existing records test described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the significant industry segment test described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, or the high profit test described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
(4)
Existing records test.
A profit and loss statement is material under the existing records test described in this paragraph (c)(4) if any member of the related party group creates or compiles such statement in the course of its business operations and the statement reflects the profit or loss of the related party group attributable to the provision of U.S.-connected products or services (regardless of whether the profit and loss attributable to U.S.-connected products or services is shown separately or included within the calculation of aggregate figures on the statement). For example, a profit and loss statement is described in this paragraph if it was produced for internal accounting or management purposes, or for disclosure to shareholders, financial institutions, government agencies, or any other persons. Such existing statements and the records from which they were complied (to the extent such records relate to profit and loss attributable to U.S.-connected products or services) are subject to the record maintenance requirements described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(5)
Significant industry segment test
—(i)
In general.
A profit and loss statement is material under the significant industry segment test described in this paragraph (c)(5) if—
(A) The statement reflects the profit or loss of the related party group attributable to the group's provision of U.S.-connected products or services within a single industry segment (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section);
(B) The worldwide gross revenue attributable to such industry segment is 10 percent or more of the worldwide gross revenue attributable to the group's combined industry segments; and
(C) The amount of gross revenue earned by the group from the provision of U.S.-connected products or services within such industry segment is $25 million or more in the taxable year.
(ii)
Form of the statements.
Profit and loss statements compiled for the group's provision of U.S.-connected products or services in each significant industry segment must reflect revenues and expenses attributable to the operations in such segment by all members of the related party group. Statements may show each related party's revenues and expenses separately, or may be prepared in a consolidated format. Any reasonable method may be used to allocate the group's worldwide costs within the industry segment to the U.S.-connected products or services within that segment. An explanation of the methods used to prepare consolidated statements and to allocate specific items to a particular profit and
loss statement must be made available, and the records from which the consolidations and allocations were prepared must be maintained.
(iii)
Special rule for component sales.
Where the U.S.-connected products or services consist of components that are incorporated into other products or services before sale to customers, the portion of the total gross revenue derived from sales of the finished products or services attributable to the components may be determined on the basis of relative costs of production. Thus, where relevant for determining whether the $25 million threshold in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C) of this section has been met, the amount of gross revenue derived by the related party group from the provision of the finished products or services may be reduced by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the costs of production of the related party group attributable to the component products or services that constitute U.S.-connected products or services and the denominator of which is the costs of production of the related party group attributable to the finished products in which such components are incorporated.
(iv)
Level of specificity required.
In applying the significant industry segment test of this paragraph (c)(5), groups of related products and services must be chosen to provide a reasonable level of specificity that results in the greatest number of separate significant industry segments in comparison to other possible classifications. This determination must be made on the basis of the particular facts presented by the operations of the related party group. The following rules, however, provide general guidelines for making such classifications. First, the related party group's operations that involve the provision of U.S.-connected products should be grouped into product lines. The rules of this paragraph (c)(5) should then be applied to determine if any such product line would, standing alone, constitute a significant industry segment when compared to the related party group's operations as a whole. Any significant industry segments determined at the level of product lines should be further segregated, and tested for significant industry segments, at the level of separate products. Finally, any significant industry segments determined at the level of separate products should be segregated, and tested for significant industry segments, at the level of separate models. Similar principles should be applied in classifying and testing types of services. A profit and loss statement reflecting the related party group's provision of any product or service (or group of products or services as classified under these rules) that constitutes a significant industry segment will be considered material for purposes of this paragraph (c)(5). For definitions of the terms “product”, “related products or services”, “model”, and ”product line”, see paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
(v)
Examples.
The rules for determining reasonable levels of specificity for significant industry segments may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
A related party group is engaged in the manufacture and worldwide sales of automobiles and aftermarket parts. The group's operations within the categories of “automobiles” and “aftermarket parts”. are each sufficient to constitute significant industry segments for the group under the rules of this paragraph (c)(5). No narrower classification of aftermarket parts results in any significant industry segments. Automobiles produced by the group are generally classified for marketing purposes by trade names; aggregating groups of automobiles by these trade names results in three significant industry segments, those for trade names A, B, and C. Finally, two car models sold under the trade name A (“A1” and “A2”) and one car model sold under the trade name B (“B3”), produce sufficient revenue to constitute significant industry segments. Such classifications into trade names and car models are generally used in the related party group's industry; moreover, different types of classifications would produce fewer significant industry segments. Accordingly, a reasonable level of specificity for this related party group's industry segments would be eight categories of products consisting of “automobiles”, “aftermarket parts”, “A”, “B”, “C”, “A1”, “A2”, and “B3”.

A related party group is engaged in manufacturing electronic goods that are distributed at retail in the United States by the reporting corporation. The group sells three types of products in the United States: televisions, radios, and video cassette recorders (VCRs). Each of these three broad
product areas constitutes a significant industry segment for the group as a whole. VCRs can be further segregated by price into high-end and low-end models, and the provision of each constitutes a significant industry segment for the group. Revenues from only one VCR model, model number VCRX-10, are sufficiently large to make the provision of that model a significant industry segment. With respect to televisions, the group normally accounts for these products by size. Using this classification, portable televisions, medium-sized televisions, and consoles each constitute significant industry segments. Narrower classifications by television model numbers result in no additional significant industry segments. Finally, a single radio product line, those sold under the trade name R, produces sufficient revenue to constitute a significant industry segment, but no other radio models or product groups are large enough to constitute a significant industry segment. In each case, these classifications conform to normal business practices in the industry and result in the greatest possible number of significant industry segments for this related party group. Accordingly, a reasonable level of specificity for this related party group's industry segments would include the ten categories consisting of “VCRs”, “high-end VCRs”, “low-end VCRs”, “model number VCRX-10”, “televisions”, “portable televisions”, “medium-sized televisions”, “console televisions”, “radios”, and “radio trade name R”.

High profit test
—(i)
In general.
A profit and loss statement is material under the high profit test described in this paragraph (c)(6) if—
(A) The statement reflects the profit or loss of the related party group attributable to the group's provision of U.S.-connected products or services within a single industry segment (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section);
(B) The amount of gross revenue earned by the group from the provision of U.S.-connected products or services within such industry segment is $100 million or more in the taxable year; and
(C) The return on assets test described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section is satisfied with respect to the products and services attributable to such segment.
Accordingly, a significant industry segment (as determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section) must be divided into any narrower industry segments that meet the high profit test of this paragraph (c)(6), even if such narrower segments would not, standing alone, meet the significant industry segment test of paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
(ii)
Return on assets test.
An industry segment meets the return on assets test if the rate of return on assets earned by the related party group on its worldwide operations within this industry segment exceeds 15 percent, and is at least 200 percent of the return on assets earned by the group in all industry segments combined. For purposes of this paragraph, the rate of return on assets earned by an industry segment is determined by dividing that segment's operating profit (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(v) of this section) by its identifiable assets (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section).
(iii)
Additional rules.
The rules in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) through (iv) of this section describing the application of the significant industry segment test shall apply in a similar manner for purposes of the high profit test.
(7)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii), (c)(5), and (c)(6) of this section.
(i)
U.S.-connected products or services.
The term
U.S.-connected products or services
means products or services that are imported to or exported from the United States by transfers between the reporting corporation and any of its foreign related parties.
(ii)
Industry segment.
An industry segment is a segment of the related party group's combined operations that is engaged in providing a product or service or a group of related products or services (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(vii) of this section) primarily to customers that are not members of the related party group.
(iii)
Gross revenue of an industry segment.
Gross revenue of an industry segment includes receipts (prior to reduction for cost of goods sold) both from sales to customers outside of the related party group and from sales or transfers to other industry segments within the related party group (but does not include sales or transfers between members of the related party group within the same industry segment). Interest from sources outside
the related party group and interest earned on trade receivables between industry segments is included in gross revenue if the asset on which the interest is earned is included among the industry segment's identifiable assets, but interest earned on advances or loans to other industry segments is not included.
(iv)
Identifiable assets of an industry segment.
The identifiable assets of an industry segment are those tangible and intangible assets of the related party group that are used by the industry segment, including assets that are used exclusively by that industry segment and an allocated portion of assets used jointly by two or more industry segments. The value of an identifiable asset may be determined using any reasonable method (such as book value or fair market value) applied consistently. Any allocation of assets among industry segments must be made on a reasonable basis, and a description of such basis must be provided. Assets of an industry segment that transfers products or services to another industry segment shall not be allocated to the receiving segment. Assets that represent part of the related party group's investment in an industry segment, such as goodwill, shall be included in the industry segment's identifiable assets. Assets maintained for general corporate purposes (that is, those not used in the operations of any industry segment) shall not be allocated to industry segments.
(v)
Operating profit of an industry segment.
The operating profit of an industry segment is its gross revenue (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section) minus all operating expenses. None of the following shall be added or deducted in computing the operating profit of an industry segment: revenue earned at the corporate level and not derived from the operations of any industry segment; general corporate expenses; interest expense; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other extraordinary items not reflecting the ongoing business operations of the industry segment.
(vi)
Product.
The term
product
means an item of property (or combination of component parts) that is the result of a production process, is primarily sold to unrelated parties (or incorporated by the related party group into other products sold to unrelated parties), and performs a specific function.
(vii)
Related products or services.
The term
related products or services
means groupings of products and types of services that reflect reasonable accounting, marketing, or other business practices within the industries in which the related party group operates.
(viii)
Model.
The term
model
means a classification of products that incorporate particular components, options, styles, and any other unique features resulting in product differentiation. Examples of models are electronic products that are sold or accounted for under a single model number and automobiles sold under a single model name.
(ix)
Product line.
The term
product line
means a group of products that are aggregated into a single classification for accounting, marketing, or other business purposes. Examples of product lines are groups of products that perform similar functions; products that are marketed under the same trade names, brand names, or trademarks; and products that are related economically (that is, having similar rates of profitability, similar degrees of risk, and similar opportunities for growth).
(8)
Example.
The application of the rules for determining material profit and loss statements under paragraphs (c)(4) through (7) of this section is illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
A multinational enterprise manufactures 50 different agricultural and chemical products that are sold through Subl, its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, and other subsidiaries located in foreign countries. The parent company of the enterprise, P, is a foreign corporation. The corporations participating in the enterprise form a related party group, and Subl is a reporting corporation for purposes of section 6038A. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, an analysis of the group's worldwide profit attributable to its products sold in the U.S. is relevant for determining an arm's length consideration under section 482 for the transfers of goods between Subl and its foreign affiliates.
(ii)
Existing records test.
For management purposes, the group prepares profit and loss statements that are segmented by sales in different geographic markets. One of these statements shows the combined worldwide
profitability of the group. Another statement shows the profitability of the group attributable to its North American sales. Both of these profit and loss statements reflect aggregate figures that include sales to unrelated parties of products that have been transferred from P and other group members to Subl (that is, the group's “U.S.-connected products”). The two statements meet the existing records test described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(iii)
Significant industry segments.
The group's worldwide gross revenue in all industry segments is $2 billion. An analysis of the group's 50 products demonstrates that they are reasonably grouped into eight industry segments (each of which earns roughly $250 million in worldwide gross revenue). Segments 1 through 6 relate to agricultural products and Segments 7 and 8 relate to other chemical products. More specific categories would result in groupings that generate less than 10 percent of the group's worldwide gross revenue (that is, less than $200 million each); these narrower categories would thus fail the gross revenue percentage test of paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) of this section. The gross revenue in each of the eight segments from the sale to unrelated parties of U.S.-connected products is as follows: $180 million for Segment 1; $30 million for Segment 2; and less than $25 million for each of Segments 3 through 8. Under the $25 million threshold test of paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C) of this section, the group's significant industry segments are thus limited to Segments 1 and 2. In addition, the combined operations of the group related to agricultural products (encompassing Segments 1 through 6 on an aggregated basis), constitute a single significant industry segment.
(iv)
High profit test.
One highly profitable product line within Segment 1, HPPL, accounts for $120 million gross revenue from Sub1's domestic sales of U.S.-connected products (and thus exceeds the $100 million gross revenue threshold in paragraph (c)(6)(i)(B) of this section). The return on the identifiable assets attributable to the HPPL product line is 85 percent, which is more than 15 percent and more than twice the return on assets earned by the group from its worldwide operations in its combined industry segments. The group's industry segment for HPPL thus meets the high profit test described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
(v)
Material Profit and Loss Statements.
The group's material profit and loss statements consist of statements for combined worldwide sales and North American sales (under the existing records test); Segment 1, Segment 2, and aggregated Segments 1-6 (under the significant industry segment test); and HPPL (under the high profit test). Under paragraph (c) of this section, Subl is required to retain the combined worldwide sales and North American sales profit and loss statements and to maintain sufficient records so that it can compile and supply upon request statements of the group's profitability from sales of its U.S.-connected products within Segment l, Segment 2, aggregated Segments 1-6, and HPPL. These records need not be in the possession of Subl and may be kept under the control of and produced by P or any third party. The statements for Segment l, Segment 2, aggregated Segments 1-6, and HPPL do not require tracing of actual costs to the U.S.-connected products; rather, these statements may be prepared by using any reasonable method to allocate a portion of the industry segment's overall operating costs to the sales of U.S.-connected products within that segment.
(d)
Liability for certain partnership record maintenance.
A reporting corporation to which transactions engaged in by a partnership are attributed under § 1.6038A-1 (e)(2) is subject to the record maintenance requirements of this section to the extent of the transactions so attributed.
(e)
Agreements with the District Director
—(1)
In general.
The District Director who has audit jurisdiction over the reporting corporation may negotiate and enter into an agreement with a reporting corporation that establishes the records the reporting corporation must maintain or cause another to maintain, how the records must be maintained, the period of retention for the records, and by whom the records must be maintained in order to satisfy the reporting corporation's obligations under this section.
(2)
Content of agreement
—(i)
In general.
The agreement may include provisions relating to the authorization of agent requirement, the record maintenance requirement, and the production and translation time periods that vary the rules contained in these regulations under section 6038A. The District Director will generally require a reporting corporation to maintain only those records specified under the safe harbor provisions of paragraph (c) of this section that permit an adequate audit of the income tax return of the reporting corporation and to provide such authorizations of agent that permit adequate access to such records. In most instances, required record maintenance for a particular reporting corporation under a negotiated agreement will be less than the broad range of records described under the safe harbor
provisions. Additionally, a provision specifying the effective date and the expiration date of the agreement that may vary the effective date of the regulations may be included.
(ii)
Significant industry segment test.
A District Director may determine which industry segment profit and loss statements are material for purposes of requiring the maintenance of records (under either paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the safe harbor described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section). The industry segments that the District Director determines are material need not be the industry segments that meet the significant industry segment test under paragraph (c)(5) of this section or the high profit test under paragraph (c)(6) of this section. For this purpose, a reporting corporation will be required to maintain only those records from which profit and loss statements for the related party group may be constructed with respect to industry segments identified by the District Director. To the extent that existing profit and loss statements are similar in scope and level of detail to statements for industry segments that would otherwise be described under the tests of paragraphs (c)(5) and (6) of this section, the District Director shall accept the existing statements instead of the statements that would otherwise be required under paragraphs (c)(5) and (6) of this section.
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.

# Example.
The District Director determines that RC, a reporting corporation that is a manufacturer of related chemical products, has two industry segments, Segment 1 and Segment 2. While both industry segments meet the significant industry segment test of paragraph (c)(5) of this section, Segment 1 has a relatively low volume of sales to foreign related parties. Additionally, Segment 1 consists of products that produce only a small profit margin because the product is generic and other companies also sell the product. The District Director enters into an agreement with RC that requires only records from which a profit and loss statement for the related party group can be constructed for Segment 2. Therefore, RC is not required to maintain records for Segment 1 from which a profit and loss statement for the related party group can be constructed. The other record maintenance requirements under this section apply, however.
(3)
Circumstances of agreement.
The District Director generally will enter into an agreement under this paragraph (e) upon request by the reporting corporation when the District Director believes that the District has or can obtain sufficient knowledge of the business or industry of the reporting corporation to limit the record maintenance requirement to particular documents.
(4)
Agreement as part of APA process.
An agreement with a reporting corporation under this paragraph (e) may be entered into as a part of the Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) process at any time during the APA process, insofar as the agreement relates to the subject matter of the APA.
(f)
U.S. maintenance
—(1)
General rule.
Records that must be maintained under this section must be maintained within the United States, unless the conditions described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section are met.
(2)
Non-U.S. maintenance requirements.
A reporting corporation may maintain outside the United States records not ordinarily maintained in the United States but required to be maintained in the United States under this section. However, the reporting corporation must either:
(i) Deliver to the Service the original documents (or duplicates) requested within 60 days of the request by the Service for such records and provide translations of such documents within 30 days of a request for translations of specific documents; or
(ii) Move the original documents (or duplicates) requested to the United States within 60 days of the request of the Service for such records; provide the Service with an index to the requested records, the name and address of a custodian located within the United States having control over the records, and the address where the records are located within 60 days of the Service's request for the records; and continue to maintain the records within the United States throughout the period of retention described in paragraph (g) of this section. For summons procedures with respect to records that have been moved to the
United States, see sections 6038A(e), 7602, 7603, and 7604.
With respect to any material profit and loss statements required to be created (either under paragraph (c) of this section or under an agreement with the District Director), unless otherwise specified, “120 days” shall be substituted for “60 days” in this paragraph (f)(2), and labels and text with respect to such statements must be in the English language.
(3)
Prior taxable years.
The non-U.S. maintenance requirements described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section apply to records located outside the United States that were in existence on or after March 20, 1990, without regard to the taxable year to which such records relate.
(4)
Scheduled production for high volume or other reasons.
Upon a written request, for good cause shown, the District Director may grant an extension of the time for the production or translation of the requested documents. Such requests should be made within 30 days of the request for records by the Service. If an extension is needed because of the volume of records requested or the amount of translation requested, the District Director may allow production or translation to be scheduled over a period of time so that not all records need be produced or translated at the same time.
(5)
Required U.S. maintenance.
The District Director (with the concurrence of the Assistant Commissioner (International)), may require, for cause, the maintenance within the United States of any records specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Such a requirement will be imposed only if there exists a clear pattern of failure to maintain or timely produce the required records. The assessment of a monetary penalty under section 6038A(d) and § 1.6038A-4 for failure to maintain records is not necessarily sufficient to require the maintenance of records within the United States.
(g)
Period of retention.
Records required to be maintained by section 6038A(a) and this section shall be kept as long as they may be relevant or material to determining the correct tax treatment of any transaction between the reporting corporation and a related party, but in no case less than the applicable statute of limitations on assessment and collection with respect to the taxable year in which the transaction or item to which the records relate affects the U.S. tax liability of the reporting corporation.
See
section 6001 and the regulations thereunder.
(h)
Application of record maintenance rules to banks and other financial institutions.
[Reserved]
(i)
Effective/applicability date
—(1)
In general.
This section is generally applicable on December 10, 1990. However, records described in this section in existence on or after March 20, 1990, must be maintained, without regard to when the taxable year to which the records relate began. Paragraph (a)(3)
Example 4
of this section is generally applicable for taxable years beginning after July 31, 2009.
(2)
Election to apply regulation to earlier taxable years.
A person may elect to apply the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)
Example 4
of this section to earlier taxable years in accordance with the rules set forth in § 1.482-9(n)(2).
[T.D. 8353, 56 FR 28065, June 19, 1991; T.D. 8353, 56 FR 41792, Aug. 23, 1991, as amended by T.D. 8611, 60 FR 41015, Aug. 11, 1995; T.D. 9278, 71 FR 44518, Aug. 4, 2006; T.D. 9456, 74 FR 38875, Aug. 4, 2009]
§ 1.6038A-4
Monetary penalty.
(a)
Imposition of monetary penalty
—(1)
In general.
If a reporting corporation fails to furnish the information described in § 1.6038A-2 within the time and manner prescribed in § 1.6038A-2(d), fails to maintain or cause another to maintain records as required by § 1.6038A-3, or (in the case of records maintained outside the United States) fails to meet the non-U.S. record maintenance requirements within the applicable time prescribed in § 1.6038A-3(f), a penalty of $25,000 shall be assessed for each taxable year with respect to which such failure occurs. The filing of a substantially incomplete Form 5472 constitutes a failure to file Form 5472. Where, however, the information described in § 1.6038A-2(b)(3) through (5) is not required to be reported, a Form 5472 filed without such information is not a substantially incomplete Form 5472.
(2)
Liability for certain partnership transactions.
A reporting corporation to which transactions engaged in by a partnership are attributed under § 1.6038A-1(e)(2) is subject to the rules of this section to the extent failures occur with respect to the partnership transactions so attributed.
(3)
Calculation of monetary penalty.
If a reporting corporation fails to maintain records as required by § 1.6038A-3 of transactions with multiple related parties, the monetary penalty may be assessed for each failure to maintain records with respect to each related party. The monetary penalty, however, shall be imposed on a reporting corporation only once for a taxable year with respect to each related party for a failure to furnish the information required on Form 5472, for a failure to maintain or cause another to maintain records, or for a failure to comply with the non-U.S. maintenance requirements described in § 1.6038A-3(f). An additional penalty for another failure may be imposed, however, under the rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Thus, unless such failures continue after notification as described in paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum penalty under this paragraph with respect to each related party for all such failures in a taxable year is$25,000. The members of a group of corporations filing a consolidated return are jointly and severally liable for any monetary penalty that may be imposed under this section.
(b)
Reasonable cause
—(1)
In general.
Certain failures may be excused for reasonable cause, including not timely filing Form 5472, not maintaining or causing another to maintain records as required by § 1.6038A-3, and not complying with the non-U.S. maintenance requirements described in § 1.6038A-3(f). If an affirmative showing is made that the taxpayer acted in good faith and there is reasonable cause for a failure that results in the assessment of the monetary penalty, the period during which reasonable cause exists shall be treated as beginning on the day reasonable cause is established and ending not earlier than the last day on which reasonable cause existed for any such failure. Additionally, the beginning of the 90-day period after mailing of a notice by the District Director or the Director of an Internal Revenue Service Center of a failure described in paragraph (d) of this section shall be treated as not earlier than the last day on which reasonable cause existed.
(2)
Affirmative showing required
—(i)
In general.
