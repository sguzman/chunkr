(l)(1) The following State Implementation Plan (SIP) elements are approved: The 2002 base year emissions inventory, the 2008 projection year emissions inventories, the 2008 motor vehicle emissions budgets used for planning purposes, the 2008 ozone reasonable further progress (RFP) plan, and the 2008 RFP Plan contingency measures as they apply to the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area. These elements are included in the package entitled “New York SIP for Ozone-Attainment Demonstration for New York Metro Area,” dated February 8, 2008 and supplemented on December 28, 2009 and January 26, 2011.
(2) The following SIP elements are approved: The 2002 base year emissions inventory for the Poughkeepsie 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area and the state-wide 2002 base year emissions inventory. These elements are included in a package entitled, “New York SIP for Ozone-Attainment Demonstration for Poughkeepsie, NY Area,” dated February 8, 2008 and supplemented on December 28, 2009 and January 26, 2011.
(m)(1) The 1997 8-hour ozone attainment demonstration for the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT nonattainment area included in New York's February 8, 2008 State Implementation Plan revision is approved and satisfies the requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act.
(2) The 1997 8-hour ozone attainment demonstration for the Poughkeepsie nonattainment area included in New York's February 8, 2008 State Implementation Plan revision is approved and satisfies the requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act.
(n) Effective June 3, 2016, the EPA is determining that complete quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2012 to 2014 show the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT 1997 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. Therefore, the EPA is rescinding the clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard only. The prior determination (
see
paragraph (f)(2)(viii) of this section) is in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918. The prior determination suspended the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably
available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS. This rescission of the clean data determination will result in a SIP Call for a new ozone attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard, for this area only. If the revised plan is approved by the EPA as demonstrating reasonable further progress and attainment for the more stringent 2008 NAAQS by the Moderate area attainment date, and is approved by the EPA as containing adequate contingency measures for the 2008 NAAQS, then the plan would be deemed to have also satisfied requirements of the SIP Call associated with violations for the 1997 NAAQS.
(o) The portion of the SIP submitted on April 4, 2013 addressing Clean Air Act section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) for the 2008 ozone NAAQS is disapproved.
(p)(1) The December 22, 2014 New York reasonably available control technology (RACT) analysis plan, as supplemented on September 6, 2017, submitted pursuant to the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS), which applies to the entire State, including the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) and the Jamestown 8-hour ozone marginal nonattainment areas, is conditionally approved as it applies to the Clean Air Act control techniques guidelines (CTG) requirements for major sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC).
(2) The remainder of New York's December 22, 2014 RACT analysis plan, pursuant to the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS as applied to the entire State, including the New York portion of the NY-NJ-CT and the Jamestown 8-hour ozone marginal nonattainment areas, and as it applies to non-CTG major sources of VOCs and to major sources of oxides of nitrogen (NO
X
), is approved.
(3) The December 22, 2014 New York plan submittal providing a nonattainment new source review (NNSR) certification as sufficient for purposes of the state-wide 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS, including the New York portion of the NY-NJ-CT and the Jamestown 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas, is approved.
(q) EPA is determining that the Jamestown marginal nonattainment area (consisting of Chautauqua County) has attained the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). This determination (informally known as a Clean Data Determination) is based upon complete, quality assured, and certified ambient air monitoring data that show the Jamestown Area has monitored attainment of the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the 2012-2014 and 2015-2017 monitoring periods. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for this area as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in this area, this determination shall no longer apply.
(r) New York's Section 185 Equivalency Demonstration State Implementation Plan revision submittal on January 31, 2014, and supplemented on April 7, 2014, October 13, 2016, and April 3, 2018, for the use of the State of New York's Low Emissions Vehicle (LEV II) program as an alternative program to fulfill the Clean Air Act section 185 requirement for the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT nonattainment area for the revoked 1979 1-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard is approved.
(s)
Determination of attainment by the attainment date.
Effective August 30, 2021. On February 4, 2019, the EPA determined that certain areas in New York attained the revoked 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of June 15, 2010. The

(u) The SIP revision submitted on September 25, 2018, addressing Clean Air Act section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) (prongs 1 and 2) for the 2008 ozone NAAQS is disapproved. These requirements are being addressed by § 52.1684.
(v) The portion of the SIP revision submitted on September 25, 2018, addressing Clean Air Act section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) (prongs 1 and 2) for the 2015 ozone NAAQS is disapproved.
(w)(1) The January 29, 2021, New York Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) analysis plan, submitted pursuant to the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) Serious classification, which applies to the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) nonattainment area is approved as it continues to meet the RACT requirements for the two precursors for ground-level ozone,
i.e.,
oxides of nitrogen (NO
X
) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), set forth by the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) with respect to the 2008 8-hour ozone standard.
(2) The January 29, 2021, New York Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) analysis plan, submitted pursuant to the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) Serious classification, which applies to the entire State, including the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) nonattainment area is approved as it applies to the Clean Air Act control technique guidelines (CTG) requirements for major sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC).

§ 52.1779
Control strategy: Ozone.
(a)
Determination of attaining data.
EPA has determined, as of November 15, 2011, the bi-state Charlotte-Gastonia-Rockhill, North Carolina-South Carolina nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standards for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
(b) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2008-2010, EPA determined that the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, North Carolina-South Carolina, 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment Area attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of June 15, 2011. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2) to determine, based on the Area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the Area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, North Carolina-South Carolina, 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment Area is not subject to the consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 181(b)(2).
(c)
Determination of attainment.
The EPA has determined, as of June 3, 2016, that based on 2012 to 2014 ambient air quality data, the Charlotte-Rock Hill, NC-SC 2008 ozone Marginal nonattainment area has attained the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Charlotte-Rock Hill, NC-SC nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).
[76 FR 70659, Nov. 15, 2011, as amended at 77 FR 13494, Mar. 7, 2012; 81 FR 26710, May 4, 2016]
§ 52.1780
[Reserved]
§ 52.1781
Control strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.
(a) The plan's control strategy for particulate matter as outlined in the three-year variance for the coal-fired units of Duke Power Company and Carolina Power
Light Company from the particulate emission limits of Regulation 15 N.C.A.C. 2D.0503, with submittals on June 18, September 7, October 31, and December 14, 1979, by the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, is disapproved only insofar that it provides an exemption for excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and verified malfunction. (See § 52.1770(c)(22).)
(b) The plan's control strategy for particulate matter as contained in regulation 15 NCAC 2D.0536, which was submitted on January 24 and February 21, 1983, and on December 17, 1985, and
became effective on August 1, 1987, is disapproved insofar as it provides annual opacity limits for the seven plants of Duke Power Company and for Plants Roxboro and Cape Fear of Carolina Power and Light Company.
(c) The plan's control strategy for particulate matter as contained in revisions to 15 NCAC 2D.0536 submitted on January 24, 1983, February 21, 1983, and December 17, 1985, is disapproved as it applies to the Carolina Power and Light Asheville, Lee, Sutton and Weatherspoon Plants. These plants will continue to be subject to the particulate limits of 15 NCAC 2D.0503, contained in the original SIP, submitted to EPA on January 27, 1972, and approved on May 31, 1982 at 47 FR 10884.
(d) In letters dated February 4, 1987, and June 15, 1987, the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development certified that no emission limits in the State's plan are based on dispersion techniques not permitted by EPA's stack height rules.
(e)
Determination of Attaining Data.
EPA has determined, as of January 4, 2010, the Greensboro-Winston-Salem-High Point, North Carolina, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 PM
2.5
NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 PM
2.5
NAAQS.
(f)
Determination of Attaining Data.
EPA has determined, as of January 5, 2010, the Hickory-Morganton-Lenoir, North Carolina, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 PM
2.5
NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 PM
2.5
NAAQS.
(g)
Disapproval.
EPA is disapproving portions of North Carolina's Infrastructure SIP for the 2006 24-hour PM
2.5
NAAQS addressing interstate transport, specifically with respect to section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).
(h) North Carolina submitted a control strategy plan for particulate matter entitled,
“An Act to Improve Air Quality in the State by Imposing Limits on the Emission of Certain Pollutants from Certain Facilities that Burn Coal to Generate Electricity and to Provide for Recovery by Electric Utilities of the Costs of Achieving Compliance with Those Limits.”
The State expects the resulting emission reductions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from this control plan will serve as a significant step towards meeting the 1997 PM
2.5
and 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), among other NAAQS, improving visibility in the mountains and other scenic vistas, and reducing acid rain.

§ 52.1834
Minor source permit to operate program.
Emission limitations and related provisions, which, in accordance with Rule 33-15-14-03, are established as federally enforceable conditions in North Dakota minor source operating permits, shall be enforceable by EPA. EPA reserves the right to deem permit conditions not federally enforceable. Such a determination will be made according to appropriate procedures and will be based upon the permit, permit approval procedures, or permit requirements which do not conform with the operating permit program requirements of EPA's underlying regulations.

§ 52.1835
Change to approved plan.
North Dakota Administrative Code Chapter 33-15-12, Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources, is removed from the approved plan. This change is a result of the State's September 10, 1997 request for delegation of authority to implement and enforce the Clean Air Act New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) promulgated in 40 CFR Part 60, as in effect on October 1, 1996 (except subpart Eb, which the State has not adopted). EPA granted that delegation of authority on May 28, 1998.
[63 FR 45727, Aug. 27, 1998]
§ 52.1836
Change to approved plan.
North Dakota Administrative Code Chapter 33-15-13, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, is removed from the approved plan. This change is a result of EPA's
July 7, 1995 interim approval of North Dakota's Title V Operating Permit program, in which it granted delegation of authority to North Dakota to implement and enforce Clean Air Act section 112 requirements. That delegation of authority includes, among other things, the NESHAPs promulgated in 40 CFR part 61 (“part 61 NESHAPs”). With a September 10, 1997 submittal, the State requested delegation of authority to implement and enforce the Clean Air Act part 61 NESHAPSs (except subparts B, H, K, Q, R, T, and W, pertaining to radionuclides), as in effect on October 1, 1996. EPA did not act on the State's request for delegation of authority for 40 CFR part 61, subpart I (regarding radionuclide emissions from facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other Federal facilities not covered by subpart H) because EPA rescinded subpart I subsequent to the State's adoption of these revisions.

Approval status.
(a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart the Administrator approves Ohio's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plan satisfies all the requirements of Part D, Title 1 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by January 1, 1981 for the sources covered by CTGs between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.

(a) The condition to EPA's approval of the oxides of nitrogen State Implementation Plan (SIP) codified at 40 CFR 52.1870(c)(128) is satisfied by Ohio's November 26, 2003, submittal of the change to the flow control date in the oxides of nitrogen budget trading SIP.
(b) [Reserved]
[69 FR 13234, Mar. 22, 2004]
§ 52.1877
Control strategy: Photochemical oxidants (hydrocarbons).
(a) The requirements of Subpart G of this chapter are not met because the Ohio plan does not provide for the attainment and maintenance of the national standard for photochemical oxidants (hydrocarbons) in the Metropolitan Cincinnati interstate region by May 31, 1975.
(b) The requirements of § 52.14 are not met by Rule 3745-21-09(N)(3) (a) and (e); Rule 3745-21-09(Z)(1)(a); Rule 3745-21-10, Section G; and Rule 3745-21-10, Section H, because these Ohio Rules do not provide for attainment and maintenance of the photochemical oxidant (hydrocarbon) standards throughout Ohio.
(1) USEPA is disapproving new exemptions for the use of cutback asphalt [(Rule 3745-21-09(N)(3) (a) and (e)], because Ohio did not provide documentation regarding the temperature ranges in the additional two months that the State permits the use of cutback asphalts, and a lack of training is not sufficient reason for the 1000 gallons exemptions.
(2) USEPA is disapproving Section V [Rule 3745-21-09(V)], because it contains an alternative leak testing procedure for gasoline tank trucks which USEPA finds to be unapprovable.
(3) USEPA is disapproving exclusion of the external floating roof (crude oil) storage tanks from the secondary seal requirement [Rule 3745-21-09(Z)(1)(a)],
because Ohio has not demonstrated that the relaxation would not interfere with the timely attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for ozone.
(4) USEPA is disapproving compliance test method Section G, [Rule 3745-21-10] as an alternative leak testing procedure for gasoline tank trucks, because such action on Section G, is consistent with USEPA's action on Rule 3745-21-09(V), which USEPA finds to be unapprovable.
(5) USEPA is disapproving compliance test method Section H, [Rule 3745-21-10], which involves a pressure test of only the vapor recovery lines and associated equipment. Compliance test method Section H is inconsistent with USEPA's control technique guidances and with tank truck certification regulations that are in effect in 19 other States. In addition, OEPA has presented no acceptable evidence demonstrating why this rule constitutes RACT.

§ 52.1878
[Reserved]
§ 52.1879
Review of new sources and modifications.
(a) The requirements of sections 172, 173, 182, and 189 for permitting of major new sources and major modifications in nonattainment areas for ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide are not met, because Ohio's regulations exempt source categories which may not be exempted and because the State has not adopted the new permitting requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 in a clear or enforceable manner.
(b) [Reserved]
(c) The requirements of § 51.161 of this chapter are not met because the State failed to submit procedures providing for public comment on review of new or modified stationary sources.
(d) Regulation providing for public comment. (1) For purposes of this paragraph,
Director
shall mean the
Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
(2) Prior to approval or disapproval of the construction or modification of a stationary source, the Director shall:
(i) Make a preliminary determination whether construction or modification of the stationary source should be approved, approved with conditions or disapproved;
(ii) Make available in at least one location in the region in which the proposed stationary source would be constructed or modified, a copy of all materials submitted by the owner or operator, a copy of the Director's preliminary determination, and a copy or summary of other materials, if any, considered by the Director in making his preliminary determination; and
(iii) Notify the public, by prominent advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the region in which the proposed stationary source would be constructed or modified, of the opportunity for public comment on the information submitted by the owner or operator and the Director's preliminary determination on the approvability of the new or modified stationary source.
(3) A copy of the notice required pursuant to this paragraph shall be sent to the Administrator through the appropriate regional office and to all other State and local air pollution control agencies having jurisdiction within the region where the stationary source will be constructed or modified.
(4) Public comments submitted in writing within 30 days of the date such information is made available shall be considered by the Director in making his final decision on the application.
(e) Approval—EPA is approving requests submitted by the State of Ohio on March 18, November 1, and November 15, 1994, for exemption from the requirements contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts the following counties in Ohio from the NO
X

(f) Approval—USEPA is approving two exemption requests submitted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency on September 20, 1993, and November 8, 1993, for the Toledo and Dayton ozone nonattainment areas, respectively, from the requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts the Lucas, Wood, Clark, Greene, Miami, and Montgomery Counties from the requirements to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) for major sources of nitrogen oxides (NO
X
), nonattainment area new source review (NSR) for new sources and modifications that are major for NO
X
, and the NO
X
-related requirements of the general and transportation conformity provisions. For the Dayton ozone nonattainment area, the Dayton local area has opted for an enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs. Upon final approval of this exemption, the Clark, Greene, Miami, and Montgomery Counties shall not be required to demonstrate compliance with the enhanced I/M performance standard for NO
X
. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Toledo or Dayton area(s), the exemptions from the requirements of Section 182(f) of the Act in the applicable area(s) shall no longer apply.
(g) Approval—EPA is approving an exemption from the requirements contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts Butler, Clermont, Hamilton, and Warren counties in Ohio from nonattainment NSR for new sources and modifications that are major for NO
X
.

(73) On March 28, 1983, the State of Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted amendments to the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Chapter 3745-21 and supporting data to USEPA as a proposed revision to the ozone portion of its SIP. OAC Chapter 3745-21, entitled “Carbon Monoxide, Photochemically Reactive Materials, Hydrocarbons, and Related Material Standards”, contains Ohio's VOC RACT I and II regulations. The amendments to these regulations are embodied in the OAC as follows: Definitions, Rule 3745-21-01; Attainment dates and compliance time schedules, Rule 3745-21-04; Control of emissions of organic compounds from stationary sources, Rule 3745-21-09; and Compliance test methods and procedures, Rule 3745-21-10. See (c)(15). USEPA is not taking action on the applicability of Rule 3745-21-09 to new sources of VOC, to the gasoline throughout exemption level for gasoline dispensing facilities, and to the compliance date extension for Honda of America Manufacturing, Inc. auto and motorcycle assembly plant in Marysville. USEPA is not taking action on OAC Rule 3745-21-09(AA))(2)(a) which exempts any dry cleaning facility in which less than 60,000 pounds of fabrics are cleaned per year. USEPA is not taking action on OAC Rule 3745-21-09(U)(2)(f) (i) and (ii) which apply to new sources (surface coating lines). USEPA is identifying deficiencies in the existing Rule 3745-21-09(D)(3) which contains an alternative daily emission limitation for can coating facilities. USEPA identified the following deficiencies within this rule: This rule presents equations for determining an alternative daily emission limitation. USEPA finds that the equations are incorrect in that they are based on volume of coating used (in gallons, excluding water), which in many cases can lead to erroneous results. Equivalency calculations for coatings should be performed on a basis of volume of coating solids used rather than volume of coating used. (45 FR 80824 gives an example calculation for can coating done on a volume solids basis.)

(134) On July 18, 2000, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency submitted revised rules for particulate matter. Ohio adopted these revisions to address State-level appeals by various industry groups of rules that the State adopted in 1995 that EPA approved in 1996. The revisions provide reformulated limitations on fugitive emissions from storage piles and plant roadways, selected revisions to emission limits in the Cleveland area, provisions for Ohio to follow specified criteria to issue replicable equivalent visible emission limits, the correction of limits for stationary combustion engines, and requirements for continuous emissions monitoring as mandated by 40 CFR part 51, Appendix P. The State's submittal also included modeling to demonstrate that the revised Cleveland area emission limits continue to provide for attainment of the PM
10
standards. EPA is disapproving two paragraphs that would allow revision of limits applicable to Ford Motor Company's Cleveland Casting Plant through permit revisions without the full EPA review provided in the Clean Air Act.

(155) On March 11, 2011, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency submitted Ohio's regional haze plan addressing the first implementation period of the regional haze rule requirements. This plan includes a long-term strategy with emission limits for mandating emission reductions equivalent to the reductions from implement best available retrofit technology and with emission reductions to provide Ohio's contribution toward achievement of reasonable progress goals at Class I areas affected by Ohio. The plan specifically satisfies BART requirements for non-EGUs, most notably by providing new, tighter emission limits for the P.H. Glatfelter facility in Ross County, Ohio. The plan establishes a combined daily sulfur dioxide emission limit of 24,930 pounds per day for boiler #7 and #8. The plan also includes permit number P0103673 that will impose these emission limitations on P.H. Glatfelter Company.

2
and Interstate pollutant transport provisions; What are the FIP requirements for Units 4 and 5 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Muskogee plant; and Units 1 and 2 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Sooner plant affecting visibility?
(a)
Applicability.
The provisions of this section shall apply to each owner or operator, or successive owners or operators, of the coal burning equipment designated as: Units 4 or 5 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Muskogee plant; and Units 1 or 2 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Sooner plant.
(b)
Compliance Dates.
Compliance with the requirements of this section is required within five years of the effective date of this rule unless otherwise indicated by compliance dates contained in specific provisions.
(c)
Definitions.
All terms used in this part but not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the CAA and in parts 51 and 60 of this chapter. For the purposes of this section:
24-hour period
means the period of time between 12:01 a.m. and 12 midnight.
Air pollution control equipment
includes selective catalytic control units, baghouses, particulate or gaseous scrubbers, and any other apparatus utilized to control emissions of regulated air contaminants that would be emitted to the atmosphere.
Boiler-operating-day
means any 24- hour period between 12:00 midnight and the following midnight during which any fuel is combusted at any time at the steam generating unit.
Daily average
means the arithmetic average of the hourly values measured in a 24-hour period.
Heat input
means heat derived from combustion of fuel in a unit and does not include the heat input from preheated combustion air, recirculated flue gases, or exhaust gases from other sources. Heat input shall be calculated in accordance with 40 CFR part 75.
Owner or Operator
means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or
supervises any of the coal burning equipment designated as:
(i) Unit 4 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Muskogee plant; or
(ii) Unit 5 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Muskogee plant; or
(iii) Unit 1 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Sooner plant; or
(iv) Unit 2 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Sooner plant.
Regional Administrator
means the Regional Administrator of EPA Region 6 or his/her authorized representative.
Unit
means one of the coal fired boilers covered under paragraph (a) of this section.
(d)
Emissions Limitations.
SO
2
emission limit.
The individual sulfur dioxide emission limit for a unit shall be 0.06 pounds per million British thermal units (lb/MMBtu) as averaged over a rolling 30 boiler-operating-day period. For each unit, SO
2
emissions for each calendar day shall be determined by summing the hourly emissions measured in pounds of SO
2
. For each unit, heat input for each boiler-operating-day shall be determined by adding together all hourly heat inputs, in millions of BTU. Each boiler-operating-day the thirty-day rolling average for a unit shall be determined by adding together the pounds of SO
2
from that day and the preceding 29 boiler-operating-days and dividing the total pounds of SO
2
by the sum of the heat input during the same 30 boiler-operating-day period. The result shall be the 30 boiler-operating-day rolling average in terms of lb/MMBtu emissions of SO
2
. If a valid SO
2
pounds per hour or heat input is not available for any hour for a unit, that heat input and SO
2
pounds per hour shall not be used in the calculation of the 30 boiler-operating-day rolling average for SO
2
.
(e)
Testing and monitoring.
(1) No later than the compliance date in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) for SO
2
on Units 4 and 5 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Muskogee plant; and Units 1 and 2 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Sooner plant in accordance with 40 CFR 60.8 and 60.13(e), (f), and (h), and Appendix B of Part 60. The owner or operator shall comply with the quality assurance procedures for CEMS found in 40 CFR part 75. Compliance with the emission limits for SO
2
shall be determined by using data from a CEMS.
(2) Continuous emissions monitoring shall apply during all periods of operation of the coal burning equipment, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, except for CEMS breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments. Continuous monitoring systems for measuring SO
2
and diluent gas shall complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. Hourly averages shall be computed using at least one data point in each fifteen minute quadrant of an hour. Notwithstanding this requirement, an hourly average may be computed from at least two data points separated by a minimum of 15 minutes (where the unit operates for more than one quadrant in an hour) if data are unavailable as a result of performance of calibration, quality assurance, preventive maintenance activities, or backups of data from data acquisition and handling system, and recertification events. When valid SO
2
pounds per hour, or SO
2
pounds per million Btu emission data are not obtained because of continuous monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span adjustments, emission data must be obtained by using other monitoring systems approved by the EPA to provide emission data for a minimum of 18 hours in each 24 hour period and at least 22 out of 30 successive boiler operating days.
(f)
Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements.
Unless otherwise stated all requests, reports, submittals, notifications, and other communications to the Regional Administrator required by this section shall be submitted, unless instructed otherwise, to the Director, Air and Radiation Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, to the attention of Mail Code: AR, at 1201 Elm Street, Suite 500, Dallas, Texas 75270-2102. For each unit subject to the emissions limitation in this section and upon completion of the installation of CEMS as required in this section, the owner or operator shall
comply with the following requirements:
(1) For each emissions limit in this section, comply with the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for CEMS compliance monitoring in 40 CFR 60.7(c) and (d).
(2) For each day, provide the total SO
2
emitted that day by each emission unit. For any hours on any unit where data for hourly pounds or heat input is missing, identify the unit number and monitoring device that did not produce valid data that caused the missing hour.
(g)
Equipment Operations.
At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator shall, to the extent practicable, maintain and operate the unit including associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Regional Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the unit.
(h)
Enforcement.
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision in this implementation plan, any credible evidence or information relevant as to whether the unit would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed, can be used to establish whether or not the owner or operator has violated or is in violation of any standard or applicable emission limit in the plan.
(2) Emissions in excess of the level of the applicable emission limit or requirement that occur due to a malfunction shall constitute a violation of the applicable emission limit.
