However, the programs or activities of entities that
are licensed or certified by the agency are not, themselves, covered by this part.

§§ 2706.131-2706.139
[Reserved]
§ 2706.140
Employment.
No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.
§§ 2706.141-2706.148
[Reserved]
§ 2706.149
Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.
Except as otherwise provided in § 2706.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.
§ 2706.150
Program accessibility: Existing facilities.
(a)
General.
The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—
(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or
(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 2706.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
(b)
Methods
—(1)
General.
The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements
to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
(2)
Historic preservation programs.
In meeting the requirements of § 2706.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 2706.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—
(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;
(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or
(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
(c)
Time period for compliance.
The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
(d)
Transition plan.
In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987 a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;
(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.
§ 2706.151
Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.
Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.
§§ 2706.152-2706.159
[Reserved]
§ 2706.160
Communications.
(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.
(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.
(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.
(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons
with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.
(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.
(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 2706.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
§§ 2706.161-2706.169

# Subpart A—Filing Rules
§ 4000.1
What are these filing rules about?
Where a particular regulation calls for their application, the rules in this subpart A of part 4000 tell you what filing methods you may use for any submission (including a payment) to us. They do not cover an issuance from you to anyone other than the PBGC, such as a notice to participants. Also, they do not cover filings with us that are not made under our regulations, such as procurement filings, litigation filings, and applications for employment with us. (Subpart B tells you what methods you may use to issue a notice or otherwise provide information to any person other than us. Subpart C tells you how we determine your filing or issuance date. Subpart D tells you how to compute various periods of time. Subpart E tells you how to maintain required records in electronic form.)
§ 4000.2
What definitions do I need to know for these rules?
You need to know two definitions from § 4001.2 of this chapter: PBGC and person. You also need to know the following definitions:
Filing
means any notice, information, or payment that you submit to us under our regulations.
Issuance
means any notice or other information you provide to any person other than us under our regulations.
We
means the PBGC.
You
means the person filing with us.
§ 4000.3

(i) This electronic filing requirement does not apply to premium information to the extent that the PBGC grants an exemption for good cause in appropriate circumstances.
(ii) This electronic filing requirement does not apply to premium payments except to the extent that the PBGC so provides in the instructions on the PBGC's Web site.

(3) You must file notices under part 4043 of this chapter electronically in accordance with the instructions on PBGC's Web site,
http://www.pbgc.gov
, except as otherwise provided by PBGC.
(4) When making filings to PBGC under parts 4041A, 4245, 4262, and 4281 of this chapter (except for notices of benefit reductions and notices of restoration of benefits under part 4281), you must submit the information required under these parts electronically in accordance with the instructions on the PBGC's Web site, except as otherwise provided by the PBGC.
(c)
Information on how to file.
Current information on how to file, including permitted filing methods, fax numbers, and mail and e-mail addresses, is—
(1) On our Web site,
http://www.pbgc.gov;
(2) In our various printed forms and instructions packages; and
(3) Available by contacting our Customer Service Center at 445 12th Street SW, Washington, DC 20024-2101; telephone 1-800-400-7242 (for participants), or 1-800-736-2444 (for practitioners). (If you are deaf or hard of hearing or have a speech disability, please dial 7-1-1 to access telecommunications relay services.)
[70 FR 11543, Mar. 9, 2005, as amended at 71 FR 31080, June 1, 2006; 79 FR 13559, Mar. 11, 2014; 80 FR 55002, Sept. 11, 2015; 80 FR 55745, Sept. 17, 2015; 80 FR 57717, Sept. 25, 2015; 86 FR 36620, July 12, 2021; 87 FR 57825, Sept. 22, 2022]
§ 4000.4

We retain the discretion to waive any requirement under this part, at any time, if warranted by the facts and circumstances.

# Subpart B—Issuance Rules
§ 4000.11
What are these issuance rules about?
Where a particular regulation calls for their application, the rules in this subpart B of part 4000 tell you what methods you may use to issue a notice or otherwise provide information to any person other than us (e.g., a participant or beneficiary). They do
not
cover payments to third parties. In some cases, the PBGC regulations tell you to comply with requirements that are found somewhere other than in the PBGC's own regulations (e.g., requirements under the Internal Revenue Code). If so, you must comply with any applicable issuance rules under those other requirements. (Subpart A tells you what filing methods you may use for filings with us. Subpart C tells you how we determine your filing or issuance date. Subpart D tells you how to compute various periods of time. Subpart E tells you how to maintain required records in electronic form.)
§ 4000.12

You need to know two definitions from § 4001.2 of this chapter: PBGC and person. You also need to know the following definitions:
Filing
means any notice, information, or payment that you submit to us under our regulations.

means any notice or other information you provide to any person other than us under our regulations.
We
means the PBGC.

§ 4000.13
What methods of issuance may I use?
(a)
In general.
You may use any method of issuance, provided you use measures reasonably calculated to ensure actual receipt of the material by the intended recipient. Posting is not a permissible method of issuance under the rules of this part.
(b)
Electronic safe-harbor method.
Section 4000.14 provides a safe-harbor method for meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section when providing an issuance using electronic media.
§ 4000.14
What is the safe-harbor method for providing an issuance by electronic media?
(a)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, rule or regulation, you satisfy the requirements of § 4000.13 if you follow the methods described at paragraph (b) of this section when providing an issuance by electronic media to any person described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
(b)
Issuance requirements.
(1) You must take appropriate and necessary measures reasonably calculated to ensure that the system for furnishing documents—
(i) Results in actual receipt of transmitted information (e.g., using return-receipt or notice of undelivered electronic mail features, conducting periodic reviews or surveys to confirm receipt of the transmitted information); and
(ii) Protects confidential information relating to the intended recipient (e.g., incorporating into the system measures designed to preclude unauthorized receipt of or access to such information by anyone other than the intended recipient);
(2) You prepare and furnish electronically delivered documents in a manner that is consistent with the style, format and content requirements applicable to the particular document;
(3) You provide each intended recipient with a notice, in electronic or non-electronic form, at the time a document is furnished electronically, that apprises the intended recipient of—
(i) The significance of the document when it is not otherwise reasonably evident as transmitted (e.g., “The attached participant notice contains information on the funding level of your defined benefit pension plan and the benefits guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.”); and
(ii) The intended recipient's right to request and obtain a paper version of such document; and
(4) You give the intended recipient, upon request, a paper version of the electronically furnished documents.
(c)
Employees with electronic access.
This section applies to a participant who—
(1) Has the ability to effectively access the document furnished in electronic form at any location where the participant is reasonably expected to perform duties as an employee; and
(2) With respect to whom access to the employer's electronic information system is an integral part of those duties.
(d)
Any person.
This section applies to any person who—
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, has affirmatively consented, in electronic or non-electronic form, to receiving documents through electronic media and has not withdrawn such consent;
(2) In the case of documents to be furnished through the Internet or other electronic communication network, has affirmatively consented or confirmed consent electronically, in a manner that reasonably demonstrates the person's ability to access information in the electronic form that will be used to provide the information that is the subject of the consent, and has provided an address for the receipt of electronically furnished documents;
(3) Prior to consenting, is provided, in electronic or non-electronic form, a clear and conspicuous statement indicating:
(i) The types of documents to which the consent would apply;
(ii) That consent can be withdrawn at any time without charge;
(iii) The procedures for withdrawing consent and for updating the participant's, beneficiary's or other person's address for receipt of electronically furnished documents or other information;
(iv) The right to request and obtain a paper version of an electronically furnished document, including whether the paper version will be provided free of charge;
(v) Any hardware and software requirements for accessing and retaining the documents; and

We retain the discretion to waive any requirement under this part, at any time, if warranted by the facts and circumstances.

# Subpart C—Determining Filing and Issuance Dates
§ 4000.21
What are these rules for determining the filing or issuance date about?
Where the particular regulation calls for their application, the rules in this subpart C of part 4000 tell you how we will determine the date you send us a filing and the date you provide an issuance to someone other than us (such as a participant). These rules do
not
cover payments to third parties. In addition, they do not cover filings with us that are not made under our regulations, such as procurement filings, litigation filings, and applications for employment with us. In some cases, the PBGC regulations tell you to comply with requirements that are found somewhere other than in the PBGC's own regulations (e.g., requirements under the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26, USC)). In meeting those requirements, you should follow any applicable rules under those requirements for determining the filing and issuance date. (Subpart A tells you what filing methods you may use for filings with us. Subpart B tells you what methods you may use to issue a notice or otherwise provide information to any person other than us. Subpart D tells you how to compute various periods of time.
Subpart E tells you how to maintain required records in electronic form.)
§ 4000.22
What definitions do I need to know for these rules?
You need to know two definitions from § 4001.2 of this chapter: PBGC and person. You also need to know the following definitions:
Business day
means a day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday.
We
means the PBGC.
You
means the person filing with us or the person providing the issuance to a third party.
§ 4000.23
When is my submission or issuance treated as filed or issued?
(a)
Filed or issued when sent.
Generally, we treat your submission as filed, or your issuance as provided, on the date you send it, if you meet certain requirements. The requirements depend upon the method you use to send your submission or issuance (see §§ 4000.24 through 4000.29). (Certain filings are always treated as filed when received, as explained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.) A submission made through our Web site is considered to have been sent when you perform the last act necessary to indicate that your submission is filed and cannot be further edited or withdrawn.
(b)
Filed or issued when received
—(1)
In general.
If you do not meet the requirements for your submission or issuance to be treated as filed or issued when sent (see §§ 4000.24 through 4000.32), we treat it as filed or issued on the date received in a permitted format at the proper address.
(2)
Certain filings always treated as filed when received.
We treat the following submissions as filed on the date we receive your submission, no matter what method you use:
(i)
Applications for benefits.
An application for benefits or related submission (unless the instructions for the applicable forms provide for an earlier date);
(ii)
Advance notice of reportable events.
Information required under subpart C of part 4043 of this chapter, dealing with advance notice of reportable events;
(iii)
Form 200 filings.
Information required under subpart D of part 4043 of this chapter, dealing with notice of certain missed minimum funding contributions; and
(iv)
Requests for approval of multiemployer plan amendments.
A request for approval of an amendment filed with the PBGC pursuant to part 4220 of this chapter.
(3)
Determining our receipt date for your filing.
If we receive your submission at the correct address by 5 p.m. (our time) on a business day, we treat it as received on that date. If we receive your submission at the correct address after 5 p.m. on a business day, or anytime on a weekend or Federal holiday, we treat it as received on the next business day. For example, if you send your fax or e-mail of a Form 200 filing to us in Washington, DC, on Friday, March 15, from California at 3 p.m. (Pacific standard time), and we receive it immediately at 6 p.m. (our time), we treat it as received on Monday, March 18. A submission made through our Web site is considered to have been received when we receive an electronic signal that you have performed the last act necessary to indicate that your submission is filed and cannot be further edited or withdrawn.
[68 FR 61347, Oct. 28, 2003, as amended at 70 FR 11543, Mar. 9, 2005]
§ 4000.24
What if I mail my submission or issuance using the U.S. Postal Service?
(a)
In general.
Your filing or issuance date is the date you mail your submission or issuance using the U.S. Postal Service if you meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, and you mail it by the last scheduled collection of the day. If you mail it later than that, or if there is no scheduled collection that day, your filing or issuance date is the date of the next scheduled collection. If you do not meet the requirements of paragraph (b), your filing or issuance date is the date of receipt at the proper address.
(b)
Requirements for “send date.”
Your submission or issuance must meet the applicable postal requirements, be properly addressed, and you must use First-Class Mail (or a U.S. Postal Service mail class that is at least the equivalent of First-Class Mail, such as Priority Mail or Express Mail). However,
if you are filing an advance notice of reportable event or a Form 200 (notice of certain missed contributions), see § 4000.23(b); these filings are always treated as filed when received.
(c)
Presumptions.
We make the following presumptions—
(1)
U.S. Postal Service postmark.
If you meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and your submission or issuance has a legible U.S. Postal Service postmark, we presume that the postmark date is the filing or issuance date. However, you may prove an earlier date under paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
Private meter postmark.
If you meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and your submission or issuance has a legible postmark made by a private postage meter (but no legible U.S. Postal Service postmark) and arrives at the proper address by the time reasonably expected, we presume that the metered postmark date is your filing or issuance date. However, you may prove an earlier date under paragraph (a) of this section.
(d)
Examples.
(1) You mail your issuance using the U.S. Postal Service and meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. You deposit your issuance in a mailbox at 4 p.m. on Friday, March 15 and the next scheduled collection at that mailbox is 5 p.m. that day. Your issuance date is March 15. If on the other hand you deposit it at 6 p.m. and the next collection at that mailbox is not until Monday, March 18, your issuance date is March 18.
(2) You mail your submission using the U.S. Postal Service and meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. You deposit your submission in the mailbox at 4 p.m. on Friday, March 15, and the next scheduled collection at that mailbox is 5 p.m. that day. If your submission does not show a March 15 postmark, then you may prove to us that you mailed your submission by the last scheduled collection on March 15.
§ 4000.25
What if I use the postal service of a foreign country?
If you send your submission or issuance using the postal service of a foreign country, your filing or issuance date is the date of receipt at the proper address.
§ 4000.26
What if I use a commercial delivery service?
(a)
In general.
Your filing or issuance date is the date you deposit your submission or issuance with the commercial delivery service if you meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, and you deposit it by the last scheduled collection of the day for the type of delivery you use (such as two-day delivery or overnight delivery). If you deposit it later than that, or if there is no scheduled collection that day, your filing or issuance date is the date of the next scheduled collection. If you do not meet the requirements of paragraph (b), your filing or issuance date is the date of receipt at the proper address. However, if you are filing an advance notice of reportable event or a Form 200 (notice of certain missed contributions), see § 4000.23(b); these filings are always treated as filed when received.
(b)
Requirements for “send date.”
Your submission or issuance must meet the applicable requirements of the commercial delivery service, be properly addressed, and—
(1)
Delivery within two days.
It must be reasonable to expect your submission or issuance will arrive at the proper address by 5 p.m. on the second business day after the next scheduled collection; or
(2)
Designated delivery service.
You must use a “designated delivery service” under section 7502(f) of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26, USC). Our Web site,
http://www.pbgc.gov,
lists those designated delivery services. You should make sure that both the provider and the particular type of delivery (such as two-day delivery) are designated.
(c)
Example.
You send your submission by commercial delivery service using two-day delivery. In addition, you meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Suppose that the deadline for two-day delivery at the place you make your deposit is 8 p.m. on Friday, March 15. If you deposit your submission by that the deadline, your filing date is March 15. If, instead, you deposit it after the 8
p.m. deadline and the next collection at that site for two-day delivery is on Monday, March 18, your filing date is March 18.
§ 4000.27
What if I hand deliver my submission or issuance?
Your filing or issuance date is the date of receipt of your hand-delivered submission or issuance at the proper address. A hand-delivered issuance need not be delivered while the intended recipient is physically present. For example, unless you have reason to believe that the intended recipient will not receive the notice within a reasonable amount of time, a notice is deemed to be received when you place it in the intended recipient's office mailbox. Our Web site,
http://www.pbgc.gov,
and the instructions to our forms, identify the proper addresses for filings with us.
§ 4000.28
[Reserved]
§ 4000.29
What if I use electronic delivery?
(a)
In general.
Your filing or issuance date is the date you electronically transmit your submission or issuance to the proper address if you meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Note that we always treat an advance notice of reportable event and a Form 200 (notice of certain missed contributions) as filed when received. A submission made through our Web site is considered to have been transmitted when you perform the last act necessary to indicate that your submission is filed and cannot be further edited or withdrawn. You do not have to address electronic submissions made through our Web site. We are responsible for ensuring that such submissions go to the proper place.
(1)
Filings.
For electronic filings, if you fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section, we may treat your submission as invalid.
(2)
Issuances.
For electronic issuances, we may treat your issuance as invalid if—
(i) You fail to meet the requirements (“using measures reasonably calculated to ensure actual receipt”) of § 4000.13(a), or
(ii) You fail to meet the contact information requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(b)
Requirements.
To get the filing date under paragraph (a) of this section, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3). To get the issuance date under paragraph (a), you must meet the requirement of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3).
(1)
Technical requirements for filings.
For filings, your electronic submission must comply with any technical requirements for that type of submission (our Web site,
http://www.pbgc.gov,
identifies the technical requirements for each type of filing).
(2)
Technical requirements for issuances.
For issuances, you must comply with the safe-harbor method under § 4000.14.
(3)
Identify contact person.
For an e-mail submission or issuance with an attachment, you must include, in the body of your e-mail, the name and telephone number of the person to contact if we or the intended recipient needs you to resubmit your filing or issuance.
(c)
Failure to meet address requirement.
If you send your electronic submission or issuance to the wrong address (but you meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section), your filing or issuance date is the date of receipt at the proper address.
[68 FR 61347, Oct. 28, 2003, as amended at 70 FR 11544, Mar. 9, 2005]
§ 4000.30
What if I need to resend my filing or issuance for technical reasons?
(a)
Request to resubmit
—(1)
Filing.
We may ask you to resubmit all or a portion of your filing for technical reasons (for example, because we are unable to open an attachment to your e-mail). In that case, your submission (or portion) is invalid. However, if you comply with the request or otherwise resolve the problem (e.g., by providing advice that allows us to open the attachment to your e-mail) by the date we specify, your filing date for the submission (or portion) that we asked you to resubmit
is the date you filed your original submission. If you comply with our request late, your submission (or portion) will be treated as filed on the date of your resubmission.
(2)
Issuance.
The intended recipient may, for good reason (of a technical nature), ask you to resend all or a portion of your issuance (for example, because of a technical problem in opening an attachment to your e-mail). In that case, your issuance (or portion) is invalid. However, if you comply with the request or otherwise resolve the problem (e.g., by providing advice that the recipient uses to open the attachment to your e-mail), within a reasonable time, your issuance date for the issuance (or portion) that the intended recipient asked you to resend is the date you provided your original issuance. If you comply with the request late, your issuance (or portion) will be treated as provided on the date of your reissuance.
(b)
Reason to believe submission or issuance not received or defective.
If you have reason to believe that we have not received your submission (or have received it in a form that is not useable), or that the intended recipient has not received your issuance (or has received it in a form that is not useable), you must promptly resend your submission or issuance to get your original filing or issuance date. However, we may require evidence to support your original filing or issuance date. If you are not prompt, or you do not provide us with any evidence we may require to support your original filing or issuance date, your filing or issuance date is the filing or issuance date of your resubmission or reissuance.
§ 4000.31
Is my issuance untimely if I miss a few participants or beneficiaries?
The PBGC will not treat your issuance as untimely based on your failure to provide the issuance to a participant or beneficiary in a timely manner if—
(a) The failure resulted from administrative error;
(b) The failure involved only a
de minimis
percentage of intended recipients; and
(c) You resend the issuance to the intended recipient promptly after discovering the error.
§ 4000.32
Does the PBGC have discretion to waive any requirements under this part?
We retain the discretion to waive any requirement under this part, at any time, if warranted by the facts and circumstances.

# Subpart D—Computation of Time
§ 4000.41
What are these computation-of-time rules about?
The rules in this subpart D of part 4000 tell you how to compute time periods under our regulations (e.g., for filings with us and issuances to third parties) where the particular regulation calls for their application. (There are specific exceptions or modifications to these rules in § 4007.6 of this chapter (premium payments), and § 4062.10 of this chapter (employer liability payments). In some cases, the PBGC regulations tell you to comply with requirements that are found somewhere other than in the PBGC's own regulations (e.g., requirements under the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26, USC)). In meeting those requirements, you should follow any applicable computation-of-time rules under those other requirements. (Subpart A tells you what filing methods you may use for filings with us. Subpart B tells you what methods you may use to issue a notice or otherwise provide information to any person other than us. Subpart C tells you how we determine your filing or issuance date.

§ 4000.42
What definitions do I need to know for these rules?
You need to know two definitions from § 4001.2 of this chapter: PBGC and person. You also need to know the following definitions:
Business day
means a day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday.
We
means the PBGC.
You
means the person responsible, under our regulations, for the filing or issuance to which these rules apply.
§ 4000.43
How do I compute a time period?
(a)
In general.
If you are computing a time period to which this part applies, whether you are counting forwards or backwards, the day after (or before) the act, event, or default that begins the period is day one, the next day is day two, and so on. Count all days, including weekends and Federal holidays. However, if the last day you count is a weekend or Federal holiday, extend or shorten the period (whichever benefits you in complying with the time requirement) to the next regular business day. The examples in paragraph (d) of this section illustrate these rules.
(b)
When date is designated.
In some cases, our regulations designate a specific day as the end of a time period, such as “the last day” of a plan year or “the fifteenth day” of a calendar month. In these cases, you simply use the designated day, together with the weekend and holiday rule of paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
When counting months.
If a time period is measured in months, first identify the date (day, month, and year) of the act, event, or default that begins the period. The corresponding day of the following (or preceding) month is one month later (or earlier), and so on. For example, two months after July 15 is September 15. If the period ends on a weekend or Federal holiday, follow the weekend and holiday rule of paragraph (a) of this section. There are two special rules for determining what the corresponding day is when you start counting on a day that is at or near the end of a calendar month:
(1)
Special “last-day” rule.
If you start counting on the last day of a calendar month, the corresponding day of any calendar month is the last day of that calendar month. For example, a three-month period measured from November 30 ends (if counting forward) on the last day of February (the 28th or 29th) or (if counting backward) on the last day of August (the 31st).
(2)
Special February rule.
If you start counting on the 29th or 30th of a calendar month, the corresponding day of February is the last day of February. For example, a one-month period measured from January 29 ends on the last day of February (the 28th or 29th).
(d)
Examples
—(1)
Counting backwards.
Suppose you are required to file an advance notice of reportable event for a transaction that is effective December 31. Under our regulations, the notice is due at least 30 days before the effective date of the event. To determine your deadline, count December 30 as day 1, December 29 as day 2, December 28 as day 3, and so on. Therefore, December 1 is day 30. Assuming that day is not a weekend or holiday, your notice is timely if you file it on or before December 1.
(2)
Weekend or holiday rule.
Suppose you are filing a notice of intent to terminate. The notice must be issued at least 60 days and no more than 90 days before the proposed termination date. Suppose the 60th day before the proposed termination date is a Saturday. Your notice is timely if you issue it on the following Monday even though that is only 58 days before the proposed termination date. Similarly, if the 90th day before the proposed termination date is Wednesday, July 4 (a Federal holiday), your notice is timely if you issue it on Tuesday, July 3, even though that is 91 days before the proposed termination date.
(3)
Counting months.
Suppose you are required to issue a Participant Notice two months after December 31. The deadline for the Participant Notice is the last day of February (the 28th or 29th). If the last day of February is a weekend or Federal holiday, your deadline is extended until the next day that is not a weekend or Federal holiday.

# Subpart E—Electronic Means of Record Retention
§ 4000.51
What are these record retention rules about?
The rules in this subpart E of part 4000 tell you what methods you may use to meet any record retention requirement under our regulations if you choose to use electronic means. The rules for who must retain the records, how long the records must be maintained, and how records must be made
available to us are contained in the specific part where the record retention requirement is found. (Subpart A tells you what filing methods you may use for filings with us and how we determine your filing date. Subpart B tells you what methods you may use to issue a notice or otherwise provide information to any person other than us. Subpart C tells you how we determine your filing or issuance date. Subpart D tells you how to compute various periods of time.)
§ 4000.52
What definitions do I need to know for these rules?
You need to know two definitions from § 4001.2 of this chapter: PBGC and person. You also need to know the following definitions:
We
means the PBGC.
You
means the person subject to the record retention requirement.
§ 4000.53
May I use electronic media to satisfy PBGC's record retention requirements?
General requirements.
You may use electronic media to satisfy the record maintenance and retention requirements of this chapter if:
(a) The electronic recordkeeping system has reasonable controls to ensure the integrity, accuracy, authenticity and reliability of the records kept in electronic form;
(b) The electronic records are maintained in reasonable order and in a safe and accessible place, and in such manner as they may be readily inspected or examined (for example, the recordkeeping system should be capable of indexing, retaining, preserving, retrieving and reproducing the electronic records);
(c) The electronic records are readily convertible into legible and readable paper copy as may be needed to satisfy reporting and disclosure requirements or any other obligation under section 101(f), section 303(k)(4), or Title IV of ERISA;
(d) The electronic recordkeeping system is not subject, in whole or in part, to any agreement or restriction that would, directly or indirectly, compromise or limit a person's ability to comply with any reporting and disclosure requirement or any other obligation under section 101(f), section 303(k)(4), or Title IV of ERISA;
(e) Adequate records management practices are established and implemented (for example, following procedures for labeling of electronically maintained or retained records, providing a secure storage environment, creating back-up electronic copies and selecting an off-site storage location, observing a quality assurance program evidenced by regular evaluations of the electronic recordkeeping system including periodic checks of electronically maintained or retained records; and retaining paper copies of records that cannot be clearly, accurately or completely transferred to an electronic recordkeeping system); and
(f) All electronic records exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability when displayed on a video display terminal or other method of electronic transmission and when reproduced in paper form. The term “legibility” means the observer must be able to identify all letters and numerals positively and quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. The term “readability” means that the observer must be able to recognize a group of letters or numerals as words or complete numbers.
[68 FR 61347, Oct. 28, 2003, as amended at 80 FR 55002, Sept. 11, 2015]
§ 4000.54
May I dispose of original paper records if I keep electronic copies?
You may dispose of original paper records any time after they are transferred to an electronic recordkeeping system that complies with the requirements of this subpart, except such original records may not be discarded if the electronic record would not constitute a duplicate or substitute record under the terms of the plan and applicable federal or state law.

§ 4001.2
Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter (unless otherwise indicated or required by the context):
Affected party
means, with respect to a plan—
(1) Each participant in the plan;
(2) Each beneficiary of a deceased participant;
(3) Each alternate payee under an applicable qualified domestic relations order, as defined in section 206(d)(3) of ERISA;
(4) Each employee organization that currently represents any group of participants;
(5) For any group of participants not currently represented by an employee organization, the employee organization, if any, that last represented such group of participants within the 5-year period preceding issuance of the notice of intent to terminate; and
(6) The PBGC.
If an affected party has designated, in writing, a person to receive a notice on behalf of the affected party, any reference to the affected party (in connection with the notice) shall be construed to refer to such person.
Annuity
means a series of periodic payments to a participant or surviving beneficiary for a fixed or contingent period.
Bankruptcy filing date
means, with respect to a plan, the date on which a petition commencing a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code is filed, or the date on which any similar filing is made commencing a case under any similar Federal law or law of a State or political subdivision, with respect to the contributing sponsor of the plan, if such case has not been dismissed as of the termination date of the plan. If a bankruptcy petition is filed under one chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or under one chapter or provision of any such similar law, and the case is converted to a case under a different chapter or provision of such Code or similar law (for example, a Chapter 11 reorganization case is converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation case), the date of the original petition is the bankruptcy filing date. If such a plan has more than one contributing sponsor:
(1) If all contributing sponsors entered bankruptcy on the same date, that date is the bankruptcy filing date;
(2) If all contributing sponsors did not enter bankruptcy on the same date (or if not all contributing sponsors are in bankruptcy), PBGC will determine the date that will be treated as the bankruptcy filing date based on the facts and circumstances, which may include such things as the relative sizes of the contributing sponsors, the relative amounts of their minimum required contributions to the plan, the timing of the different bankruptcies, and the expectations of participants.
Basic-type benefit
means a benefit that is guaranteed under part 4022 of this chapter or that would be guaranteed if the guarantee limits in §§ 4022.22 through 4022.27 of this chapter did not apply.

For purposes of determining the persons liable for contributions under section 412(b)(2) of the Code or section 302(b)(2) of ERISA, or for premiums under section 4007(e)(2) of ERISA, a controlled group also includes any group treated as a single employer under section 414 (m) or (o) of the Code.

The Director will timely provide the Board any information necessary to assist the Board in exercising its statutory responsibilities. The Director must submit the Corporation's budget to the Chair of the Board for review and approval before formally submitting the budget to OMB.

The senior officers of the Corporation report directly to the Director. The Director must consult with the Board before eliminating or creating a senior officer position or making an appointment to a senior officer position.
§ 4002.8
Emergency procedures.
(a) An emergency exists if a quorum of the Corporation's Board cannot readily be assembled or act through written contact because of the declaration of a government-wide emergency. These emergency procedures must remain in effect during the emergency and upon the termination of the emergency will cease to be operative unless and until another emergency occurs. The emergency procedures operate in conjunction with the PBGC Continuity of Operations Plan (“COOP Plan”) of the current year, and any government-wide COOP protocols in effect.
(b) During an emergency, the business of the PBGC must continue to be managed in accordance with its COOP Plan. The functions of the Board of Directors must be carried out by those Members of the Board of Directors in office at the time the emergency arises, or by persons designated by the agencies' COOP plans to act in place of the Board Members, who are available to act during the emergency. If no such persons are available, then the authority of the Board must be transferred to the Board Representatives who are available. If no Board Representatives are available, then the Director of the Corporation must perform essential Board functions.
(c) During an emergency, meetings of the Board may be called by any available Member of the Board. The notice thereof must specify the time and place of the meeting. To the extent possible, notice must be given in accordance with these bylaws.

(c) The decision of the Appeals Board will be in writing, specify the relief granted, if any, state the bases for the decision, including a brief statement of the facts or legal conclusions supporting the decision, and state that the appellant has exhausted his or her administrative remedies.

§ 4003.60
Referral of appeal to the Director.
The Appeals Board may, in its discretion, refer any appeal to the Director of PBGC for decision. In such a case, the Director will have all the powers vested in the Appeals Board by this subpart and the decision of the Director will meet the requirements of and
have the effect of a decision issued under § 4003.59 of this part.

§ 4003.61
Action by a single Appeals Board member.
(a)
Authority to act.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, any member of the Appeals Board has the authority to take any action that the Appeals Board could take with respect to a routine appeal as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Routine appeal defined.
For purposes of this section, a routine appeal is any appeal that does not raise a significant issue of law or a precedent-setting issue. This would generally include any appeal that—
(1) Is outside the jurisdiction of the Appeals Board (for example, an appeal challenging the plan's termination date);
(2) Is filed by a person other than an aggrieved person or an aggrieved person's authorized representative;
(3) Is untimely and presents no grounds for waiver or extension of the time limit for filing the appeal, or only grounds that are clearly without merit;
(4) Presents grounds that clearly warrant or clearly do not warrant the relief requested;
(5) Presents only factual issues that are not reasonably expected to affect other appeals (for example, the participant's date of birth or date of hire); or
(6) Presents only issues that are controlled by settled principles of existing law, including Appeals Board precedent (for example, an issue of plan interpretation that has been resolved by the Appeals Board in a decision on an appeal by another participant in the same plan).

[61 FR 34016, July 1, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 75163, Dec. 1, 2000; 73 FR 15074, Mar. 21, 2008; 79 FR 13559, Mar. 11, 2014]
§ 4006.3
Premium rate.
Subject to the provisions of § 4006.5 (dealing with exemptions and special rules) and § 4006.7 (dealing with premiums for certain terminated single-employer plans), the premium paid for basic benefits guaranteed under section 4022(a) or section 4022A(a) of ERISA shall equal the flat-rate premium under paragraph (a) of this section
plus, in the case of a single-employer plan, the variable-rate premium under paragraph (b) of this section. Premium rates (and the MAP-21 cap rate referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) are subject to change each year under inflation indexing provisions in section 4006 of ERISA.
(a)
Flat-rate premium.
The flat-rate premium for a plan is equal to the applicable flat premium rate multiplied by the plan's participant count. The applicable flat premium rate is the amount prescribed for the calendar year in which the premium payment year begins by the applicable provisions of—
(1) Section 4006(a)(3)(A) and (G) of ERISA for a single-employer plan, or
(2) Section 4006(a)(3)(A) and (J) of ERISA for a multiemployer plan.
(b)
Variable-rate premium
—(1)
In general.
Subject to the cap provisions in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the variable-rate premium for a single-employer plan is equal to a specified dollar amount for each $1,000 (or fraction thereof) of the plan's unfunded vested benefits as determined under § 4006.4 for the UVB valuation year. The specified dollar amount is the applicable variable premium rate prescribed by the applicable provisions of ERISA section 4006(a)(8) for the calendar year in which the premium payment year begins.
(2)
MAP-21 cap.
The variable-rate premium for a plan is not more than the applicable MAP-21 cap rate multiplied by the plan's participant count. The applicable MAP-21 cap rate is the amount prescribed by the applicable provisions of ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E)(i)(II), (E)(i)(III), (K), and (L) for the calendar year in which the premium payment year begins.
(3)
Small-employer cap
—(i)
In general.
If a plan is described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section for the premium payment year, the variable-rate premium is not more than $5 multiplied by the square of the participant count. For example, if the participant count is 20, the variable-rate premium is not more than $2,000 ($5 × 20
2
= $5 × 400 = $2,000).
(ii)
Plans eligible for cap.
A plan is described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section for the premium payment year if the aggregate number of employees of all employers in the plan's controlled group on the first day of the premium payment year is 25 or fewer.
(iii)
Meaning of “employee.”
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the aggregate number of employees is determined in the same manner as under section 410(b)(1) of the Code, taking into account the provisions of section 414(m) and (n) of the Code, but without regard to section 410(b)(3), (4), and (5) of the Code.
[61 FR 34016, July 1, 1996, as amended at 72 FR 71228, Dec. 17, 2007; 73 FR 15074, Mar. 21, 2008; 79 FR 13559, Mar. 11, 2014; 88 FR 76664, Nov. 7, 2023]
§ 4006.4
Determination of unfunded vested benefits.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in the exemptions and special rules under § 4006.5, the amount of a plan's unfunded vested benefits for the UVB valuation year is the excess (if any) of the plan's premium funding target for the UVB valuation year (determined under paragraph (b) of this section) over the fair market value of the plan's assets for the UVB valuation year (determined under paragraph (c) of this section). Unfunded vested benefits for the UVB valuation year must be determined as of the plan's UVB valuation date , based on the plan provisions and the plan's population as of that date. The determination must be made in a manner consistent with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices.
(b)
Premium funding target
—(1)
In general.
A plan's premium funding target is its standard premium funding target under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or, if an election to use the alternative premium funding target under § 4006.5(g) is in effect, its alternative premium funding target under § 4006.5(g).
(2)
Standard premium funding target.
A plan's standard premium funding target under this section is the plan's funding target as determined under ERISA section 303(d) (or 303(i), if applicable) for the UVB valuation year using the same assumptions that are used for funding purposes, except that—
(i) Only vested benefits are taken into account, and
(ii) The interest rates to be used are the segment rates for the month preceding the month in which the UVB valuation year begins that are determined in accordance with ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iv). These are the rates that would be determined under ERISA section 303(h)(2)(C) if ERISA section 303(h)(2)(D) were applied by using the monthly yields for the month preceding the month in which the UVB valuation year begins on investment grade corporate bonds with varying maturities and in the top 3 quality levels rather than the average of such yields for a 24-month period. For this purpose, the transition rule in ERISA section 303(h)(2)(G) is inapplicable.
(3)
“At-risk” plans; transition rules; loading factor.
The transition rules in ERISA section 303(i)(5) apply to the determination of the premium funding target of a plan in at-risk status for funding purposes. If a plan in at-risk status is also described in ERISA section 303(i)(1)(A)(ii) for the UVB valuation year, its premium funding target reflects a loading factor pursuant to ERISA section 303(i)(1)(C) equal to the sum of—
(i)
Per-participant portion of loading factor.
The amount determined for funding purposes under ERISA section 303(i)(1)(C)(i) for the UVB valuation year, and
(ii)
Four percent portion of loading factor.
Four percent of the premium funding target determined as if the plan were not in at-risk status.
(c)
Value of assets.
The fair market value of a plan's assets under this section is determined in the same manner as for funding purposes under ERISA section 303(g)(3) and (4), except that averaging as described in ERISA section 303(g)(3)(B) must not be used and prior year contributions are included only to the extent received by the plan by the date the premium is filed. Contribution receipts must be accounted for as described in ERISA section 303(g)(4), using effective interest rates determined under ERISA section 303(h)(2)(A) (not rates that could be determined based on the segment rates described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section).
(d) “
Vested.
” For purposes of ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E), this part, and part 4007 of this chapter:
(1) A participant's benefit that is otherwise vested does not fail to be vested merely because of the circumstance that the participant is living, in the case of the following death benefits:
(i) A qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity (as described in ERISA section 205(e)),
(ii) A post-retirement survivor annuity that pays some or all of the participant's benefit amount for a fixed or contingent period (such as a joint and survivor annuity or a certain and continuous annuity), and
(iii) A benefit that returns the participant's accumulated mandatory employee contributions (as described in ERISA section 204(c)(2)(C)).
(2) A benefit otherwise vested does not fail to be vested merely because of the circumstance that the benefit may be eliminated or reduced by the adoption of a plan amendment or by the occurrence of a condition or event (such as a change in marital status).
(3) A participant's pre-retirement lump-sum death benefit (other than a benefit described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section) is not vested if the participant is living.
(4) A participant's disability benefit is not vested if the participant is not disabled.
(e) Illustration of vesting principles. The vesting principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:
(1)
Example 1.
Under Plan A, if a participant retires at or after age 55 but before age 62, the participant receives a temporary supplement from retirement until age 62. The supplement is not a QSUPP (qualified social security supplement), as defined in Treasury Reg. § 1.401(a)(4)-12, and is not protected under Code section 411(d)(6). The temporary supplement is considered vested, and its value is included in the premium funding target, for each participant who, on the UVB valuation date, is at least 55 but less than 62, and thus eligible for the supplement. The calculation is unaffected by the fact that the plan could be amended to remove the supplement after the UVB valuation date.
(2)
Example 2.
Plan B provides a qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity (QPSA) upon the death of a participant who has five years of service, at no charge to the participant. The QPSA is considered vested, and its value is included in the premium funding target, for each participant who, on the UVB valuation date, has five years of service and is thus eligible for the QPSA. The calculation is unaffected by the fact that the participant is alive on that date.
(f)
Plans to which special funding rules apply.
The following statutory provisions are disregarded for purposes of determining unfunded vested benefits (whether the standard premium funding target or the alternative premium funding target is used):
(1) Section 402(b) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280, dealing with certain frozen plans of commercial passenger airlines and airline caterers.
(2) Section 306 of ERISA and section 433 of the Code, dealing with certain defined benefit pension plans maintained by certain cooperatives and charities.
[73 FR 15074, Mar. 21, 2008, as amended at 79 FR 13560, Mar. 11, 2014; 85 FR 6058, Feb. 4, 2020]
§ 4006.5
Exemptions and special rules.
(a)
Variable-rate premium exemptions.
A plan described in any of paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section is not required to determine or report its unfunded vested benefits under § 4006.4 and does not owe a variable-rate premium under § 4006.3(b).
(1)
Plans without vested participants.
A plan is described in this paragraph if it does not have any participants with vested benefits as of the UVB valuation date.
(2)
Section 412(e)(3) plans.
A plan is described in this paragraph if the plan is a plan described in section 412(e)(3) of the Code and the regulations thereunder on the UVB valuation date.
(3)
Certain plans completing a standard termination.
A plan is described in this paragraph if it—
(i) Makes a final distribution of assets in a standard termination during the premium payment year, and
(ii) Did not engage in a spinoff during the premium payment year, unless the spinoff is de minimis pursuant to the regulations under section 414(l) of the Code.
(4)
Certain plans in the process of completing a standard termination initiated in a prior year.
A plan is described in this paragraph if —
(i) The plan administrator has issued notices of intent to terminate the plan in a standard termination in accordance with section 4041(a)(2) of ERISA;
(ii) The proposed termination date set forth in the notice of intent to terminate is before the beginning of the premium payment year; and
(iii) The plan ultimately makes a final distribution of plan assets in conjunction with the plan termination.
(5)
Certain small new and newly covered plans.
A plan is described in this paragraph if—
(i) It is a small plan other than a continuation plan, and
(ii) It is a new plan or a newly covered plan.
(b)
Reporting exemption for plans paying capped variable-rate premium.
A plan that qualifies for the variable-rate premium cap described in section 4006(a)(3)(I) of ERISA for certain small employers is not required to determine or report its unfunded vested benefits under § 4006.4 if it reports that it qualifies for the cap and pays a variable-rate premium equal to the amount of the cap.
(c)
Participant count date; in general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the participant count date of a plan is the last day of the plan year preceding the premium payment year.
(d)
Participant count date; new and newly covered plans.
The participant count date of a new plan or a newly covered plan is the first day of the premium payment year. For this purpose, a new plan's premium payment year begins on the plan's effective date.
(e)
Participant count date; certain transactions.
(1) The participant count date of a plan described in paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section is the first day of the premium payment year.
(2) With respect to a transaction where some, but not all, of the assets
and liabilities of one plan (the “transferor plan”) are transferred into another plan (the “transferee plan”)—
(i) The transferor plan if the spinoff is not de minimis and is effective at the beginning of the transferor plan's premium payment year; and
(ii) The transferee plan if the transferor plan meets the criteria in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section and the transfer occurs at the beginning of the transferee plan's premium payment year.
(3) With respect to a merger effective at the beginning of the premium payment year, the transferee plan if—
(i) The merger is not de minimis; or
(ii) The assets of the transferee plan immediately before the merger are less than the total assets transferred to the transferee plan in the merger.
(4) For purposes of this paragraph (e), “de minimis” has the meaning described in regulations under section 414(l) of the Code (for single-employer plans) or in part 4231 of this chapter (for multiemployer plans).
(f)
Proration for certain short plan years.
The premium for a plan that has a short plan year described in this paragraph (f) is prorated by the number of months in the short plan year (treating a part of a month as a month). The proration applies whether or not the short plan year ends by the premium due date for the short plan year. For purposes of this paragraph (f), there is a short plan year in the following circumstances:
(1)
New or newly covered plan.
A new plan becomes effective less than one full year before the beginning of its second plan year, or a newly covered plan becomes covered on a date other than the first day of its plan year. (Cessation of coverage before the end of a plan year does not give rise to proration under this section.)
(2)
Change in plan year.
A plan amendment changes the plan year, but only if the plan does not merge into or consolidate with another plan or otherwise cease its independent existence either during the short plan year or at the beginning of the full plan year following the short plan year.
(3)
Distribution of assets.
The plan's assets (other than any residual assets under section 4044(d) of ERISA) are distributed pursuant to the plan's termination, but only if the plan did not engage in a spinoff during the plan year, unless the spinoff is de minimis pursuant to the regulations under section 414(l) of the Code.
(4)
Appointment of trustee.
The plan is a single-employer plan, and a plan trustee is appointed pursuant to section 4042 of ERISA.
(g)
Alternative premium funding target.
A plan's alternative premium funding target is determined in the same way as its standard premium funding target except that the discount rates described in ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iv) are not used. Instead, the alternative premium funding target is determined using the discount rates that would have been used to determine the funding target for the plan under ERISA section 303 for the purpose of determining the plan's minimum contribution under ERISA section 303 for the UVB valuation year if the segment rate stabilization provisions of ERISA section 303(h)(2)(iv) were disregarded. A plan may elect to compute unfunded vested benefits using the alternative premium funding target instead of the standard premium funding target described in § 4006.4(b)(2), and may revoke such an election, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (g). A plan must compute its unfunded vested benefits using the alternative premium funding target instead of the standard premium funding target described in § 4006.4(b)(2) if an election under this paragraph (g) to use the alternative premium funding target is in effect for the premium payment year.
(1) An election under this paragraph (g) to use the alternative premium funding target for a plan must specify the premium payment year to which it first applies and must be filed by the plan's variable-rate premium due date for that premium payment year. The premium payment year to which the election first applies must begin at least five years after the beginning of the premium payment year to which a revocation of a prior election first applied. The election will be effective—
(i) For the premium payment year for which made and for all plan years
that begin less than five years thereafter, and
(ii) For all succeeding plan years until the premium payment year to which a revocation of the election first applies.
(2) A revocation of an election under this paragraph (g) to use the alternative premium funding target for a plan must specify the premium payment year to which it first applies and must be filed by the plan's variable-rate premium due date for that premium payment year. The premium payment year to which the revocation first applies must begin at least five years after the beginning of the premium payment year to which the election first applied.
[61 FR 34016, July 1, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 60428, Nov. 7, 1997; 65 FR 75163, Dec. 1, 2000; 71 FR 31081, June 1, 2005; 73 FR 15075, Mar. 21, 2008; 79 FR 13560, Mar. 11, 2014; 85 FR 6058, Feb. 4, 2020; 88 FR 76664, Nov. 7, 2023]
§ 4006.6
Definition of “participant.”
(a)
General rule.
For purposes of this part and part 4007 of this chapter, an individual is considered to be a participant in a plan on any date if the plan has benefit liabilities with respect to the individual on that date.
(b)
Loss or distribution of benefit.
For purposes of this section, an individual is treated as no longer being a participant—
(1) In the case of an individual with no vested accrued benefit, after—
(i) The individual incurs a one-year break in service under the terms of the plan,
(ii) The individual's entire “zero-dollar” vested accrued benefit is deemed distributed under the terms of the plan, or
(iii) The individual dies; and
(2) In the case of a living individual whose accrued benefit is fully or partially vested, or a deceased individual whose accrued benefit was fully or partially vested at the time of death, after—
(i) An insurer makes an irrevocable commitment to pay all benefit liabilities with respect to the individual, or
(ii) All benefit liabilities with respect to the individual are otherwise distributed.
(c)
Examples.
The operation of this section is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Participation under a calendar-year plan begins upon commencement of employment, and the only benefit provided by the plan is an accrued benefit (expressed as a life annuity beginning at age 65) of $30 per month times full years of service. The plan credits a ratable portion of a full year of service for service of at least 1,000 hours but less than 2,000 hours in a service computation period that begins on the date when the participant commences employment and each anniversary of that date. John and Mary both commence employment on July 1, 2008. On December 31, 2008 (the participant count date for the plan's 2009 premium), John has credit for 988 hours of service and Mary has credit for 1,006 hours of service. For purposes of this section, Mary is considered to have an accrued benefit, and John is considered not to have an accrued benefit. Thus, the plan is considered to have benefit liabilities with respect to Mary, but not John, on December 31, 2008; and Mary, but not John, must be counted as a participant for purposes of computing the plan's 2009 premium.

# Example 2.
The plan also provides that a participant becomes vested five years after commencing employment and defines a one-year break in service as a service computation period in which less than 500 hours of service is performed. On February 1, 2010, John has an accrued benefit of $18 per month beginning at age 65 based on credit for 1,200 hours of service in the service computation period that began July 1, 2008. However, John has credit for only 492 hours of service in the service computation period that began July 1, 2009. On February 1, 2010, John terminates his employment. On December 31, 2010 (the participant count date for the 2011 premium), John has incurred a one-year break in service, and thus is not counted as a participant for purposes of computing the plan's 2011 premium.

# Example 3.
On January 1, 2012, the plan is amended to provide that if a vested participant whose accrued benefit has a present value of $5,000 or less leaves employment, the benefit will be immediately cashed out. On December 30, 2013, Jane, who has a vested benefit with a present value of less than $5,000, leaves employment. Because of reasonable administrative delay in determining the amount of the benefit to be paid, the plan does not pay Jane the value of her benefit until January 9, 2014. Under the provisions of this section, Jane is treated as not having an accrued benefit on December 31, 2013 (the participant count date for the 2014 premium), because Jane's benefit is treated as having been paid on December 30, 2013. Thus, Jane is not counted as a participant
for purposes of computing the plan's 2014 premium.

# Example 4.
If the plan amendment had instead provided for cashouts as of the first of the month following termination of employment, and the plan paid Jane the value of her benefit on January 1, 2014, Jane would be treated under the provisions of this section as having an accrued benefit on December 31, 2013, and would thus be counted as a participant for purposes of computing the plan's 2014 premium.
[65 FR 75163, Dec. 1, 2000, as amended at 73 FR 15076, Mar. 21, 2008]
§ 4006.7
Premium rate for certain terminated single-employer plans.
(a) The premium under this section (“termination premium”) applies to a DRA 2005 termination described in § 4007.13 of this chapter.
(b) The amount of the premium under this section that is payable with respect to each applicable 12-month period (as described in § 4007.13 of this chapter) is the number of participants in the plan, determined as of the day before the termination date, multiplied by the termination premium rate. In general, the termination premium rate is $1,250. However, the termination premium rate is $2,500 for an “eligible plan” under section 402(c)(1) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (dealing with certain plans of commercial passenger airlines and airline catering services) while an election under section 402(a)(1) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (dealing with alternative funding schedules) is in effect for the plan if the plan terminates during the five-year period beginning on the first day of the first applicable plan year (as defined in section 402(c)(2) of that Act) with respect to the plan, unless the Secretary of Labor determines that the plan terminated as a result of extraordinary circumstances such as a terrorist attack or other similar event.
(c) The premium under this section is in addition to any other premium under this part.
(d) See § 4007.13 of this chapter for further rules about termination premiums.

[61 FR 34020, July 1, 1996, as amended at 73 FR 15076, Mar. 21, 2008; 79 FR 13561, Mar. 11, 2014]
§ 4007.3
Filing requirement; method of filing.
(a)
In general.
The estimation, determination, declaration, and payment of
premiums must be made in accordance with the premium instructions on PBGC's Web site (
www.pbgc.gov
). Subject to the provisions of § 4007.13, the plan administrator of each covered plan is responsible for filing prescribed premium information and payments. Each required premium payment and related information, certified as provided in the premium instructions, must be filed by the applicable due date specified in this part in the manner and format prescribed in the instructions.
(b)
Electronic filing.
Information must be filed electronically except to the extent that PBGC grants an exemption for good cause in appropriate circumstances. (The requirement to file electronically applies to all estimated and final flat-rate and variable-rate premium filings (including amended filings) but does not apply to information filed to comply with a PBGC request under (4007.10(c) (dealing with providing record information in connection with a premium compliance review).) Unless an exemption applies, filing on paper or in any other manner other than by a prescribed electronic filing method does not satisfy the requirement to file. Failure to file electronically as required is subject to penalty under ERISA section 4071.

§ 4007.4
Where to file.
See § 4000.4 of this chapter for information on where to file.
[71 FR 31081, June 1, 2006]
§ 4007.5
Date of filing.
The PBGC applies the rules in subpart C of part 4000 of this chapter to determine the date that a submission under this part was filed with the PBGC.
[68 FR 61352, Oct. 28, 2003]
§ 4007.6
Computation of time.
The PBGC applies the rules in subpart D of part 4000 of this chapter to compute any time period under this part. However, for purposes of determining the amount of a late payment interest charge under § 4007.7 or of a late payment penalty charge under § 4007.8, the rule in § 4000.43(a) of this chapter governing periods ending on weekends or Federal holidays does not apply.
[68 FR 61352, Oct. 28, 2003]
§ 4007.7
Late payment interest charges.
(a) If any premium payment due under this part is not paid by the due date prescribed for such payment by this part, an interest charge will accrue on the unpaid amount at the rate imposed under section 6601(a) of the Code for the period from the date payment is due to the date payment is made. Late payment interest charges are compounded daily.
(b) With respect to any PBGC bill for a premium underpayment and/or interest thereon, interest will accrue only until the date of the bill if the premium underpayment and interest billed are paid within 30 days after the date of the bill.
[61 FR 34020, July 1, 1996, as amended at 72 FR 71229, Dec. 17, 2007; 73 FR 15076, Mar. 21, 2008]
§ 4007.8
Late payment penalty charges.
(a)
Penalty charge.
Subject to the provisions of § 4007.13, if any premium payment due under this part is not paid by the due date under this part, PBGC will assess a late payment penalty charge as determined under this paragraph (a), except to the extent the charge is waived under paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section. The amount determined under this paragraph (a) will be based on the number of months (counting any portion of a month as a whole month) from the due date to the date of payment. The penalty rate is—
(1) For any amount of unpaid premium that is paid on or before the date PBGC issues the first written notice to any person liable for the premium that there is or may be a premium delinquency (for example, a premium bill, a letter initiating a premium compliance review, a notice of filing error in premium determination, or a letter questioning a failure to make a premium filing),
1/2
percent per month, to a maximum penalty charge of 25 percent of the unpaid premium; or
(2) For any amount of unpaid premium that is paid after that date, 2
1/2
percent per month, to a maximum penalty charge of 50 percent of the unpaid premium.
(b)
Hardship waiver.
The PBGC may grant a waiver based upon a showing of substantial hardship as provided in section 4007(b) of ERISA.
(c)
Reasonable cause waivers.
PBGC will waive all or part of a late payment penalty charge if PBGC determines that there is reasonable cause for the late payment. Policy guidelines for applying the “reasonable cause” standard are in §§ 22 through 25 of the appendix to this part.
(d)
Other waivers.
PBGC may waive all or part of a late payment penalty charge in other circumstances without regard to whether there is reasonable cause. Policy guidelines for waivers without reasonable cause are in § 21(b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) of the appendix to this part.
(e)
Grace period.
With respect to any PBGC bill for a premium underpayment, the PBGC will waive any late payment penalty charge accruing after the date of the bill, provided the premium underpayment is paid within 30 days after the date of the bill.
(f)
Filings not more than 7 days late.
PBGC will waive premium payment penalties that arise solely because premium payments are late by not more than seven calendar days, as described in this paragraph (f). In applying this waiver, PBGC will assume that each premium payment with respect to a plan year was made seven calendar days before it was actually made. All other rules will then be applied as usual. If the result of this procedure is that no penalty would arise for that plan year, then any penalty that would apply on the basis of the actual payment date(s) will be waived.
(g)
Variable-rate premium penalty relief.
PBGC will waive the penalty on any underpayment of the variable-rate premium for the period that ends on the earlier of the date the reconciliation filing is due or the date the reconciliation filing is made if, by the date the variable-rate premium for the premium payment year is due under § 4007.11(a)(1),—
(1) The plan administrator reports—
(i) The fair market value of the plan's assets for the premium payment year, and
(ii) An estimate of the plan's premium funding target for the premium payment year that is certified by an enrolled actuary to be a reasonable estimate that takes into account the most current data available to the enrolled actuary and that has been determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices; and
(2) The plan administrator pays at least the amount of variable-rate premium determined from the value of assets and estimated premium funding target so reported.
(h)
Demonstrated compliance.
PBGC will waive 80 percent of the premium payment penalty assessed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section if the criteria in paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section are met.
(1) For each plan year within the last five plan years of coverage preceding the plan year for which the penalty rate is being determined,—
(i) Any required premium filing for the plan has been made; and
(ii) PBGC has not required payment of a penalty for the plan under this section.
(2) For the plan year for which the penalty rate is being determined, the total amount of premium is paid no later than 30 days after PBGC issues the first written notice as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
[64 FR 66385, Nov. 26, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 75164, Dec. 1, 2000; 71 FR 66869, Nov. 17, 2006; 72 FR 71229, Dec. 17, 2007; 73 FR 15076, Mar. 21, 2008; 79 FR 350, Jan. 3, 2014; 79 FR 13561, Mar. 11, 2014; 81 FR 65545, Sept. 23, 2016]
§ 4007.9
Coverage for guaranteed basic benefits.
(a) The failure to pay the premiums due under this part will not result in a plan's loss of coverage for basic benefits guaranteed under section 4022(a) or 4022A(a) of ERISA.
(b) The payment of the premiums imposed by this part will not result in coverage for basic benefits guaranteed under section 4022(a) or 4022A(a) of
ERISA for plans not covered under title IV of ERISA.
[61 FR 34020, July 1, 1996, as amended at 72 FR 71229, Dec. 17, 2007]
§ 4007.10
Recordkeeping; audits; disclosure of information.
(a)
Retention of records to support premium payments
—(1)
In general.
The designated recordkeeper under paragraph (a)(3) of this section must retain, for a period of six years after the premium due date, all plan records that are necessary to establish, support, and validate the amount of any premium required to be paid and any information required to be reported (“premium-related information”) under this part and part 4006 of this chapter and under PBGC's premium filing instructions. Records that must be retained pursuant to this paragraph include, but are not limited to, records that establish the number of plan participants and that support and demonstrate the calculation of unfunded vested benefits.
(2)
Electronic recordkeeping.
A designated recordkeeper may use electronic media for maintenance and retention of records required by this part in accordance with the requirements of subpart E of part 4000 of this chapter.
(3)
Designated recordkeepers.
(i) With respect to the flat-rate and variable-rate premiums described in § 4006.3 of this chapter, the plan administrator is the designated recordkeeper.
(ii) With respect to the premium for certain terminated single-employer plans described in § 4006.7 of this chapter, each person who was a contributing sponsor of such a plan, or was a member of a contributing sponsor's controlled group, as of the day before the plan's termination date is a designated recordkeeper.
(4)
Records.
(i) Records that must be retained pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section include, but are not limited to, records prepared by the plan administrator, a plan sponsor, an employer required to contribute to the plan with respect to its employees, an enrolled actuary performing services for the plan, or an insurance carrier issuing any contract to pay benefits under the plan.
(ii) For purposes of this section, “records” include, but are not limited to, plan documents; participant data records; personnel and payroll records; actuarial tables, worksheets, and reports; records of computations, projections, and estimates; benefit statements, disclosures, and applications; financial and tax records; insurance contracts; records of plan procedures and practices; and any other records, whether in written, electronic, or other format, that are relevant to the determination of the amount of any premium required to be paid or any premium-related information required to be reported.
(iii) When a record to be produced for PBGC inspection and copying exists in more than one format, it must be produced in the format specified by PBGC.
(b)
PBGC audit
—(1)
In general.
In order to determine the correctness of any premium paid or premium-related information reported or to determine the amount of any premium required to be paid or any premium-related information required to be reported, PBGC may—
(i) Audit any premium filing,
(ii) Inspect and copy any records that are relevant to the determination of the amount of any premium required to be paid and any premium-related information required to be reported, including (without limitation) the records described in paragraph (a) of this section, and
(iii) Require disclosure of any manual or automated system or process used to determine any premium paid or premium-related information reported, and demonstration of its operation in order to permit PBGC to determine the effectiveness of the system or process and the reliability of information produced by the system or process.
(2)
Deficiencies found on audit.
If, upon audit, PBGC determines that a premium due under this part was underpaid, late payment interest and penalty charges will apply as provided for in this part. If, upon audit, PBGC determines that required information was not timely and accurately reported, a penalty may be assessed under ERISA section 4071.
(3)
Insufficient records.
In determining the premium due, if, in the judgment of PBGC, a plan's records fail to establish the participant count or (for a single-
employer plan) the plan's unfunded vested benefits for any premium payment year, PBGC may rely on data it obtains from other sources (including the IRS and the Department of Labor) for presumptively establishing the participant count and/or unfunded vested benefits for premium computation purposes.
(c)
Providing record information
—(1)
In general.
A designated recordkeeper must make the records retained pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section available to PBGC promptly upon request for inspection and photocopying (or, for electronic records, inspection, electronic copying, and printout) at the location where they are kept (or another, mutually agreeable, location). If PBGC requests in writing that records retained pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or information in such records, be submitted to PBGC, the designated recordkeeper must submit the requested materials to PBGC either electronically or by hand, mail, or commercial delivery service within 45 days of the date of PBGC's request therefor, or by a different time specified in the request.
(2)
Extension.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a designated recordkeeper may automatically extend the period described in paragraph (c)(1) by submitting a certification to the PBGC prior to the expiration of that time period. The certification shall—
(i) Specify a date to which the time period described in paragraph (c)(1) is extended that is no more than 90 days from the date of the PBGC's written request for information; and
(ii) Contain a statement, certified to by the designated recordkeeper under penalty of perjury (18 U.S.C. § 1001), that, despite reasonable efforts, the additional time is necessary to comply with the PBGC's request.
(3)
Shortening of time period.
The PBGC may in its discretion shorten the time period described in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section where it determines that the interests of PBGC may be prejudiced by a delay in the receipt of the information (e.g., where collection of unpaid premiums (or any associated interest or penalties) would otherwise be jeopardized). If the PBGC shortens the time period described in paragraph (c)(1), no extension is available under paragraph (c)(2).
(d)
Address and timeliness.
Information required to be submitted under paragraph (c) of this section shall be submitted to the address specified in the PBGC's request. The timeliness of a submission shall be determined in accordance with §§ 4007.5 and 4007.6.
[61 FR 34020, July 1, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 36663, July 9, 1997; 68 FR 61352, Oct. 28, 2003; 72 FR 71229, Dec. 17, 2007; 73 FR 15077, Mar. 21, 2008]
§ 4007.11
Due dates.
(a)
In general.
In general:
(1) The flat-rate and variable-rate premium filing due date is the fifteenth day of the tenth calendar month that begins on or after the first day of the premium payment year.
(2) If the variable-rate premium paid by the premium filing due date is estimated as described in § 4007.8(g)(1)(ii), a reconciliation filing and any required variable-rate premium payment must be made by the end of the sixth calendar month that begins on or after the premium filing due date.
(3)
Small plan transition rule.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a plan had fewer than 100 participants for whom flat-rate premiums were payable for the plan year preceding the last plan year that began before 2014, then the plan's due date for the first plan year beginning after 2013 is the fifteenth day of the fourteenth calendar month that begins on or after the first day of that plan year.
(b)
Plans that change plan years.
For a plan that changes its plan year, the flat-rate and variable-rate premium filing due date for the short plan year is as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. For the plan year that follows a short plan year, the due date is the later of —
(1) The due date specified in paragraph (a) of this section, or
(2) 30 days after the date on which the amendment changing the plan year was adopted.
(c)
New and newly covered plans.
For a new plan or newly covered plan, the flat-rate and variable-rate premium filing due date for the first plan year of coverage is the latest of—
(1) The due date specified in paragraph (a) of this section, or
(2) 90 days after the date of the plan's adoption, or
(3) 90 days after the date on which the plan became covered by title IV of ERISA, or
(4) In the case of a small plan that is a continuation plan, 90 days after the plan's UVB valuation date.
(d)
Terminating plans.
For a plan that terminates in a standard termination, the flat-rate and variable-rate premium filing due date for the plan year in which all plan assets are distributed pursuant to the plan's termination is the earlier of—
(1) The due date specified in paragraph (a) of this section, or
(2) The date when the post-distribution certification under § 4041.29 of this chapter is filed.
(e)
Continuing obligation to file.
The obligation to make flat-rate and variable-rate premium filings and payments under this part continues through the plan year in which all plan assets are distributed pursuant to a plan's termination or in which a trustee is appointed under section 4042 of ERISA, whichever occurs earlier.
[79 FR 13561, Mar. 11, 2014]
§ 4007.12
Liability for single-employer premiums.
(a) The designation under this part of the plan administrator as the person required to make flat-rate and variable-rate premium filings and payments under this part for a single-employer plan is a procedural requirement only and does not alter the liability for premium payments imposed by section 4007 of ERISA. Pursuant to section 4007(e) of ERISA, both the plan administrator and the contributing sponsor of a single-employer plan are liable for flat-rate and variable-rate premium payments, and, if the contributing sponsor is a member of a controlled group, each member of the controlled group is jointly and severally liable for the required premiums. Any entity that is liable for required premiums is also liable for any interest and penalties assessed with respect to such premiums.
(b) After a plan administrator issues (pursuant to section 4041(a)(2) of ERISA) the first notice of intent to terminate in a distress termination under section 4041(c) of ERISA or PBGC issues a notice of determination under section 4042(a) of ERISA, the obligation to pay the premiums (and any interest or penalties thereon) imposed by ERISA and this part for a single-employer plan shall be an obligation solely of the contributing sponsor and the members of its controlled group, if any.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1212-0009)
[61 FR 34020, July 1, 1996, as amended at 72 FR 71229, Dec. 17, 2007; 79 FR 13562, Mar. 11, 2014]
§ 4007.13
Premiums for certain terminated single-employer plans.
(a)
Applicability
—(1)
In general.
This section applies where there is a “DRA 2005 termination” of a plan. Subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, there is a DRA 2005 termination where a single-employer plan's termination date is after 2005 and either—
(i) The plan terminates under section 4042 of ERISA, or
(ii) The plan terminates under section 4041(c) of ERISA and at least one contributing sponsor or member of a contributing sponsor's controlled group meets the requirements of section 4041(c)(2)(B)(ii) or (iii) of ERISA.

Plans terminated during reorganization proceedings.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a DRA 2005 termination of a plan does not occur where as of the plan's termination date—

(ii) The proceeding is pending as a reorganization proceeding under chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code (or under any similar law of a State or political subdivision of a State),
(iii) The person has not been discharged from the proceeding, and

(3)
Special rule for certain airline-related plans.
Paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply to an “eligible plan” under section 402(c)(1) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (dealing with certain plans of commercial passenger airlines and airline catering services) while an election under section 402(a)(1) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (dealing with alternative funding schedules) is in effect for the plan.
(4)
Termination premium.
A premium as described in § 4006.7 of this chapter is payable to PBGC with respect to a DRA 2005 termination each year for three years after the termination (the “termination premium”).
(b)
Filing requirements; method of filing.
Notwithstanding § 4007.3, in the case of a DRA 2005 termination of a plan, each person that was a contributing sponsor of the plan on the day before the plan's termination date or that was on that day a member of any controlled group of which any such contributing sponsor was a member is responsible for filing prescribed termination premium information and payments. Any such person may file on behalf of all such persons.
(c)
Late payment penalty charges.
Notwithstanding § 4007.8(a), if any required termination premium payment is not filed by the due date under paragraph (d) of this section, PBGC may assess a late payment penalty charge based on the facts and circumstances, subject to waiver under § 4007.8(b), (c), (d), or (e). The charge will not exceed the amount of termination premium not timely filed.
(d)
Due dates.
Notwithstanding § 4007.11, the due date for the termination premium is the 30th day of each of three applicable 12-month periods. The three applicable 12-month periods with respect to a DRA 2005 termination of a plan are—
(1)
First applicable 12-month period.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section, the period of 12 calendar months beginning with the first calendar month following the calendar month in which occurs the plan's termination date, and
(2)
Subsequent applicable 12-month periods.
Each of the first two periods of 12 calendar months that immediately follow the first applicable 12-month period.
(e)
Certain reorganization cases.
(1) This paragraph (e) applies with respect to a DRA 2005 termination of a plan if the conditions in both paragraph (e)(2) and paragraph (e)(3) of this section are satisfied.

(i) There is not pending any bankruptcy proceeding that was filed by or against such person and that was, as of the plan's termination date, a reorganization proceeding under chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code (or under
any similar law of a State or political subdivision of a State), or
(ii) The person has been discharged in any such proceeding, or
(iii) The person no longer exists.
(f)
Plan termination date in past when set.
If a plan's termination date is in the past when it is established by agreement or court action as described in section 4048 of ERISA, then the first applicable 12-month period for determining the due dates of the termination premium begins with the later of—
(1) The first calendar month following the calendar month in which the termination date is established by agreement or court action as described in section 4048 of ERISA, or

# Waiver Standards
21 What are the standards for waiving a premium penalty?
(a)
Facts and circumstances.
In deciding whether to waive a premium penalty in whole or in part under paragraph (b), we consider the facts and circumstances of each case.
(b)
Waivers
—(1)
Provisions of law.
We waive all or part of a premium penalty if a statute or regulation requires that we do so. For example, ERISA section 4007(b) and § 4007.8 of this part provide for a waiver in certain circumstances involving business hardship, and § 4007.8 of this part also provides , and for a waiver of a premium penalty that accrues after the date of a bill for a premium underpayment if you pay the premium owed within 30 days after the date of the bill, and for waivers in certain cases where you pay not more than a week late or where you estimate the variable-rate premium and then timely correct any underpayment.
(2)
Reasonable cause.
We waive a premium penalty if you show reasonable cause for a failure to pay a premium in full and on time. See §§ 22 through 25 for guidelines on “reasonable cause” waivers. If there is reasonable cause for only part of a failure to pay a premium, we waive the premium penalty only for that part.
(3)
Legal errors.
We may waive all or part of a premium penalty if the failure to pay a premium in full and on time that gives rise to the premium penalty results from certain kinds of legal errors.
(i)
Erroneous legal interpretation—disclosed.
If a failure to pay a premium in full and on time results from your reliance on an erroneous interpretation of the law, we waive a premium penalty that arises from the failure if you promptly and adequately call our attention to the interpretation and the relevant facts, and the erroneous interpretation is not frivolous. If the interpretation affects a filing that you make with us, you should call our attention to the interpretation in writing with the filing. If you rely on the interpretation to justify not making a filing with us, you should call our attention to the interpretation in writing by the time prescribed for the filing not made.
(ii)
Erroneous legal interpretation—undisclosed.
If a failure to pay a premium in full and on time results from your reliance on an erroneous interpretation of the law, and you do not promptly and adequately call our attention to the interpretation and the relevant facts, we may nevertheless waive a premium penalty if the weight of authority supporting the interpretation is substantial in relation to the weight of opposing authority and it is reasonable for you to rely on the interpretation.
(iii)
Recent change in the law.
We may waive all or part of a premium penalty if the law changes shortly before the date a premium payment is due and the premium payment that you make by the due date would have been correct under the law as in effect before the change. In determining whether and to what extent to grant a waiver in a case of this kind, we consider such factors as the length of time between the change in the law and the premium due date, the nature and timing of any publicity given to the change in the law, the complexity of the legal issues, and your general familiarity with those issues.
(4)
Pendency of PBGC procedures.
We may waive all or a part of a premium penalty that is attributable to the pendency of PBGC review or other procedures. For example:
(i) If you request review of a premium penalty, and you make a non-frivolous argument in your request for review that you were not required to pay the premium or that you were, and still are, unable to obtain the information needed to determine the premium, we may waive the portion of the premium penalty that accrues during the review process. If you make such a non-frivolous argument with respect to a portion of the premium, we may apply this principle to that portion.
(ii) We may waive all or a part of a premium penalty if we believe that the pendency of PBGC procedures for identifying a premium delinquency and notifying you of the delinquency contributed to your failure to correct the delinquency more promptly.
(5)
Other circumstances.
We may waive all or part of a premium penalty in other circumstances if we determine that it is appropriate to do so.
(c)
Action or inaction of outside parties.
In some cases an accountant, actuary, lawyer, pension consultant, or other individual or firm that is not part of your organization may assist you in complying with PBGC requirements. If the outside individual's or firm's action, inaction, or advice causes or contributes to a failure to pay a premium in full and on time, we apply our waiver authority as if the outside individual or firm were part of your organization. In the case of an outside individual who is part of a firm, we generally consider both the individual and the firm to be part of your organization.
22 What is “reasonable cause”?
(a)
General rule.
In general, there is “reasonable cause” for a failure to pay a premium in full and on time to the extent that—
(1) The failure arises from circumstances beyond your control, and
(2) You could not avoid the failure by the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence.
(b)
Overlooking legal requirements.
Overlooking legal requirements does not constitute reasonable cause.
(c)
Action or inaction of outside parties.
If an accountant, actuary, lawyer, pension consultant, or other individual or firm that is not part of your organization assists you in complying with PBGC requirements, there is generally no reasonable cause for a failure to pay a premium in full and on time that arises from circumstances within the control of the outside individual or firm, or could be avoided by the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence by the outside individual or firm. The fact that you exercised care and prudence in selecting and monitoring the outside individual or firm is not a basis for a reasonable cause waiver.
(d)
Size of organization.
If an organization or one or more of its employees is responsible for taking action, the size of the organization may affect what ordinary business care and prudence would require. For example, ordinary business care and prudence would typically require a larger organization to establish more comprehensive backup procedures than a smaller organization for dealing with situations such as computer failure, the loss of important records, and the inability of an individual to carry out assigned responsibilities. Thus, there may be reasonable cause for a small organization's failure to pay a premium in full and on time even though, if the organization were larger, the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence would have avoided the failure.
(e)
Size of premium underpayment.
In general, the larger a premium, the more care and prudence you should use to make sure that you pay it in full and on time. Thus, there may be reasonable cause for a small underpayment even though, under the same circumstances, we would conclude that a larger underpayment could have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence.
(f)
Collection and enforcement.
In determining whether reasonable cause exists, we do not consider either—
(i) The likelihood or cost of collecting the premium penalty, or
(ii) The costs and risks of enforcing the premium penalty by litigation.
23 What kinds of facts does PBGC consider in determining whether there is reasonable cause for a failure to pay a premium?
In determining the extent to which a failure to pay a premium in full and on time arose from circumstances beyond your control and the extent to which you could have avoided the failure by the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence—and thus the extent to which waiver of a premium penalty for reasonable cause is appropriate—we consider facts such as the following:
(a) What event or circumstance caused the underpayment and when the event happened or the circumstance arose. The dates you give should clearly correspond with the underpayment upon which the premium penalty is based.
(b) How that event or circumstance kept you from paying the premium in full and on time. The explanation you give should relate directly to the failure to pay a premium that is the subject of the premium penalty.
(c) Whether you could have anticipated the event or circumstance.
(d) How you responded to the event or circumstance, including what steps you took, and how quickly you took them, to pay the premium and how you conducted other business affairs. Knowing how you responded to the event or circumstance may help us determine what degree of business care and prudence you were capable of exercising during that period and thus whether the failure to pay the premium could or could not have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence.
24 What are some situations that might justify a “reasonable cause” waiver?
The following examples illustrate some of the reasons often given for failures to pay premiums for which we may assess penalties. The situation described in each example may constitute reasonable cause, and each example lists factors we consider in determining whether to grant a premium penalty waiver for reasonable cause in a case of that kind.
(a)
An individual with responsibility for taking action was suddenly and unexpectedly absent or unable to act.
We consider such factors as the following: The nature of the event that caused the individual's absence or inability to act, for example, the resignation of the individual or the death or serious illness of the individual or a member of the individual's immediate family; the size of the organization and what kind of backup procedures it had to cope with such events; how close the event was to the deadline that was missed; how abrupt and unanticipated the event was; how the individual's absence or inability to act prevented compliance; how expensive it would have been to comply without the absent individual; whether and how other business operations and obligations were affected; how quickly and prudently a replacement for the absent individual was selected or other arrangements for compliance were made; and how quickly a replacement for the absent individual took appropriate action.
(b)
A fire or other casualty or natural disaster destroyed relevant records or prevented compliance in some other way.
We consider such factors as the following: The nature of the
event; how close the event was to the deadline that was missed; how the event caused the failure to pay the premium; whether other efforts were made to get needed information; how expensive it would have been to comply; and how you responded to the event.
(c)
You reasonably relied on erroneous oral or written advice given by a PBGC employee.
We consider such factors as the following: Whether there was a clear relationship between your situation and the advice sought; whether you provided the PBGC employee with adequate and accurate information; and whether the surrounding circumstances should have led you to question the correctness of the advice or information provided.
(d)
You were unable to obtain information, including records and calculations, needed to comply.
We consider such factors as the following: What information was needed; why the information was unavailable; when and how you discovered that the information was not available; what attempts you made to get the information or reconstruct it through other means; and how much it would have cost to comply.
25 What are some situations that might justify a partial “reasonable cause” waiver?
(a) Assume that a fire destroyed the records needed to compute a premium payment. If in the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence it should take you one month to reconstruct the records and pay the premium, but the payment was made two months late, it might be appropriate to waive that part of the premium penalty attributable to the first month the payment was late, but not the part attributable to the second month.
(b) Assume that a plan administrator underpaid the plan's flat-rate premium because of reasonable reliance on erroneous advice from a PBGC employee, and also underpaid the plan's variable-rate premium because the plan actuary used the wrong interest rate. A PBGC audit revealed both errors. PBGC billed the plan for a premium penalty of $5,000—$1,000 for underpayment of the flat-rate premium and $4,000 for underpayment of the variable-rate premium. The plan administrator requested a waiver of the premium penalty. While the erroneous PBGC advice constituted reasonable cause for underpaying the flat-rate premium, there was no showing of reasonable cause for the error in the variable-rate premium. Therefore, we would waive only the part of the premium penalty based on underpayment of the flat-rate portion of the premium ($1,000).

[70 FR 11544, Mar. 9, 2005, as amended at 74 FR 11029, Mar. 16, 2009]
§ 4010.4
Filers.
(a)
General.
Unless a waiver in § 4010.11 of this part applies, a contributing sponsor of a plan and each member of the contributing sponsor's controlled group on the last day of the information year is a filer with respect to an information year (unless exempted under paragraph (c) of this section) if—
(1) For any plan (including an exempt plan) maintained by the members of the contributing sponsor's controlled group on the last day of the information year, the 4010 funding target attainment percentage for the plan year ending within the information year is less than 80 percent;
(2) Any member of the controlled group fails to make a required installment or other required payment to a plan and, as a result, the conditions for imposition of a lien described in ERISA section 303(k) or 306(g) and Code section 430(k) or 433(g) have been met during the information year, and the required installment or other required payment is not made within ten days after its due date; or
(3) Any plan maintained by a member of the controlled group has been granted one or more minimum funding waivers under ERISA section 302(c) and Code section 412(c) totaling in excess of $1 million, and as of the end of the plan year ending within the information year, any portion thereof is still outstanding.
(b) 4010
Funding target attainment percentage
—(1)
General.
The 4010 funding target attainment percentage for a plan for a plan year equals the funding target attainment percentage as provided under ERISA section 303(d)(2) and Code section 430(d)(2) determined without regard to the interest rate stabilization provisions of ERISA section 303(h)(2)(C)(iv) and Code section 430(h)(2)(C)(iv).
(2)
Assets used to determine 4010 funding target attainment percentage.
For purposes of determining the 4010 funding target attainment percentage for a plan for the plan year, the value of plan assets determined under ERISA section 303(g)(3) and Code section 430(g)(3) may (but need not) be substituted for the asset value determined without regard to the interest rate stabilization provisions of ERISA section 303(h)(2)(C)(iv) and Code section 430(h)(2)(C)(iv).
(3)
Prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance elections.
For purposes of determining the 4010 funding target attainment percentage for a plan for the plan year, prefunding balances and funding standard carryover balances must reflect any elections (or deemed elections) under ERISA section 303(f) and Code section 430(f) that affect the value of such balances as of the beginning of the plan year, regardless of when the elections (or deemed elections) are made.
(c)
Exempt entities.
A person is an exempt entity for an information year if the conditions of paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section are satisfied.
(1) The person is not a contributing sponsor of a plan (other than an exempt plan) as of the last day of the information year.
(2) The person has revenue for its fiscal year ending within the controlled group's information year that is five
percent or less of the revenue of the person's controlled group for the fiscal year(s) ending within the information year.
(3) The person has annual operating income for the fiscal year ending within the controlled group's information year that is no more than the greater of—
(i) Five percent of the controlled group's annual operating income for the fiscal year(s) ending within the information year, or
(ii) $5 million.
(4) The person has net assets at the end of the fiscal year ending within the controlled group's information year that is no more than the greater of—
(i) Five percent of the controlled group's net assets at the end of the fiscal year(s) ending within the information year, or
(ii) $5 million.
(d)
Minimum funding waiver
—(1)
General.
For purposes of § 4010.4(a)(3), a portion of the minimum funding waiver for a plan is considered outstanding unless prior to the plan year ending within the information year the statutory amortization period has ended, or, as of the valuation date for the plan year ending within the information year, the amortization bases are deemed to be reduced to zero pursuant to ERISA section 303(e)(5) and Code section 430(e)(5).
(2)
Example.
Company A sponsors Plan X, which received a minimum funding waiver of $700,000 for the plan year ending December 31, 2004, and another waiver of $500,000 for the plan year ending December 31, 2008. Assume that the amortization bases of the waivers are not reduced to zero pursuant to ERISA section 303(e)(5) and Code section 430(e)(5), and the waivers are therefore outstanding for the full five-year statutory amortization period. Also, assume Company A has a calendar information year. For the 2009 information year, Company A must report under ERISA section 4010. However, for the 2010 information year, Company A, assuming no other obligation to report under ERISA section 4010, is not required to report.
(e)
Certain plans to which special funding rules apply.
Except for purposes of determining the information to be submitted under § 4010.8(h) (in connection with the actuarial valuation report), the following statutory provisions are disregarded for purposes of this part:
(1) Section 402(b) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280, dealing with certain frozen plans of commercial passenger airlines and airline caterers.
(2) Section 306 of ERISA and section 433 of the Code, dealing with certain defined benefit pension plans maintained by certain cooperatives and charities.
[74 FR 11030, Mar. 16, 2009, as amended at 81 FR 15439, Mar. 23, 2016; 85 FR 6059, Feb. 4, 2020]
§ 4010.5
Information year.
(a)
Determinations based on information year.
An information year is used under this part to determine which persons are filers (§ 4010.4), what information a filer must submit (§§ 4010.6-4010.9), whether a plan is an exempt plan (§ 4010.8(c)), and the due date for submitting the information (§ 4010.10(a)).
(b)
General.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a person's information year is the fiscal year of the person. A filer is not required to change its fiscal year or the plan year of a plan, to report financial information for any accounting period other than an existing fiscal year, or to report actuarial information for any plan year other than an existing plan year.
(c)
Controlled group members with different fiscal years.
If members of a controlled group (disregarding any exempt entity) report financial information on the basis of different fiscal years, the information year is the calendar year. (If any two members of the controlled group report financial information on the basis of different fiscal years, the determination of whether an entity is an exempt entity is based on a calendar year information year for purposes of this paragraph (c) and § 4010.4(c).)
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rule in paragraph (c) of this section.
(1)
Example 1.
Companies A and B are the only members of the same controlled group, and both are contributing sponsors to nonexempt plans. Company A has a July 1 fiscal year,
and Company B has an October 1 fiscal year. The information year is the calendar year. Company A's financial information with respect to its fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, and Company B's financial information with respect to its fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, must be submitted to the PBGC following the end of the 2009 calendar year information year.
(2)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that Company B is not a contributing sponsor of a plan and would be an exempt entity using the calendar year as the information year. Because Company B is an exempt entity based on a calendar year information year, it is excluded when determining the information year. Thus, the information year is the July 1 fiscal year. Note that Company B is an exempt entity even if it would not be exempt based on the July information year.
(3)
Example 3.
The facts are the same as in Example 2 except that Company B would not be an exempt entity using the calendar year information year but would be exempt based on an information year that is the July 1 fiscal year. Since Company B is not exempt based on a calendar year information year, it may not be excluded when determining the information year. Therefore, the information year is the calendar year and Company B is not an exempt entity.
(e)
Special rules for certain plan years.
If a plan maintained by the members of the contributing sponsor's controlled group has two plan years that end in the information year or has no plan year that ends in the information year, the last plan year ending on or immediately before the end of information year is deemed to be the plan year ending within the information year.
[61 FR 34022, July 1, 1996, as amended at 70 FR 11544, Mar. 9, 2005; 74 FR 11031, Mar. 16, 2009]

(b)
Alternative methods of compliance
—(1)
At-risk funding target.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a filer is not required to provide the information specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section for the plan year for which actuarial information is being reported unless PBGC requests in writing that the information be provided, in which case the filer must provide the information within 30 days of such request or such later date as PBGC specifies in the request.
(2)
Actuarial valuation report.
If any of the information specified in paragraph (a)(11) of this section is not available by the date specified in § 4010.10(a), a filer may satisfy the requirement to provide such information by—
(i) Including a statement, with the material that is submitted to PBGC, that the filer will file the unavailable information by the alternative due date specified in § 4010.10(b), and
(ii) Filing such information (along with a certification by an enrolled actuary under paragraph (a)(12) of this section) with PBGC by that alternative due date.
(c)
Exempt plan.
The actuarial information specified in this section is not required with respect to a plan if the plan satisfies the conditions in paragraph (c)(1) through (3).
(1) The plan—
(i) Has fewer than 500 participants as of the end of the plan year ending within the information year or as of the valuation date for that plan year and has a 4010 funding shortfall (as defined in § 4010.11(a)(1)) for the plan year ending within the information year that is not in excess of $15 million, or
(ii) Has benefit liabilities as of the end of the plan year ending within the filer's information year, (determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section) equal to or less than the fair market value of the plan's assets.
(2) The plan has received, by or within ten days after the due dates, all required installments or other payments required to be made during the information year under ERISA sections 302 and 303 and Code sections 412 and 430.
(3) The plan has no outstanding minimum funding waivers (as described in § 4010.4(a)(3)) as of the end of the plan year ending within the information year.
(d)
Value of benefit liabilities.
The value of a plan's benefit liabilities at the end of a plan year must be determined using the plan census data described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the actuarial assumptions and methods described in paragraph (d)(2) or, where applicable, (d)(3) of this section.
(1)
Census data
—(i)
Census data period.
Plan census data must be determined (for all plans for any information year)
either as of the end of the plan year or as of the beginning of the next plan year.
(ii)
Projected census data.
If actual plan census data are not available, a plan may use a projection of plan census data from a date within the plan year. The projection must be consistent with projections used to measure pension obligations of the plan for financial statement purposes and must give a result appropriate for the end of the plan year for these obligations. For example, adjustments to the projection process are required where there has been a significant event (such as a plan amendment or a plant shutdown) that has not been reflected in the projection data.
(2)
Actuarial assumptions and methods.
The value of benefit liabilities must be determined using the rules in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i)
Benefits to be valued.
Benefits to be valued include all benefits earned or accrued under the plan as of the end of the plan year ending within the information year and other benefits payable from the plan including, but not limited to, ancillary benefits and retirement supplements, regardless of whether such benefits are protected by the anti-cutback provisions of section 411(d)(6) of the Code.
(ii)
Actuarial assumptions.
The value of benefit liabilities must be determined using the actuarial assumptions described in the following table:
Table 1 to Paragraph (
d
)(2)(
ii
)
Assumptions:
As prescribed in accordance with
Interest
§ 4044.54.
Form of payment
§ 4044.51.
Expenses
§ 4044.52(d).
Decrements
• Mortality
§ 4044.53.
• Retirement
§§ 4044.55 through 4044.58.
• Other decrements (
e.g.,
turnover, disability)
Either Option 1 or Option 2—
Option 1
Disregard (
i.e.,
assume 0% probability of decrements other than mortality or retirement occurring)
Option 2
Use the same assumptions as used to determine the minimum required contribution under section 303 of ERISA and section 430 of the Code for the plan year ending within the filer's information year.
If there is no distinction between termination and retirement assumptions, reflect only rates for ages before the Earliest PBGC Retirement Date (as defined in § 4022.10 of this chapter).
Cash balance plan account conversions
Section 204(b)(5)(B)(vi) of ERISA and section 411(b)(5)(B)(vi) of the Code (which deal with the interest crediting rate and annuity conversion rates), as if the plan terminated on the last day of the plan year ending within the filer's information year. Expected improvements in mortality experience that apply under the plan for periods after the information year may be disregarded for valuing benefit liabilities for 4010 reporting purposes.
Other (
e.g.,
cost-of-living increases, marital status)
Use the same assumptions as used to determine the minimum required contribution under section 303 of ERISA and section 430 of the Code for the plan year ending within the filer's information year.
(iii)
Future service.
Future service expected to be accrued by an active participant in an ongoing plan during future employment (based on the assumptions used to determine benefit liabilities) must be included in determining the earliest and unreduced retirement ages used to determine the expected retirement age and in determining an active participant's entitlement to early retirement subsidies and supplements at the expected retirement age. See the examples in paragraph (e) of this section.
(3)
Special actuarial assumptions for exempt plan determination.
Solely for purposes of determining whether a plan is an exempt plan for an information year, the value of benefit liabilities may be determined using the same retirement assumptions as used to determine the minimum required contribution under section 303 of ERISA and section 430 of the Code for the plan year ending within that information year without regard to the at-risk assumptions of section 303(i) of ERISA and section 430(i) of the Code.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples demonstrate how XRA is determined and applied for purposes of determining benefit liabilities under paragraph (d) of this section:
(1)
Example 1
—(i)
Facts.
Plan X has a normal retirement age of 65, but allows benefits to commence as early as age 55 for participants who complete at least 10 years of service before termination. Early retirement benefits are reduced for participants with fewer than 25 years of service. Employee A is an active participant who is age 40 and has completed 5 years of service. Assume the “medium” XRA look-up table applies, and that for purposes of § 4010.8(d), the filer has decided not to take pre-retirement decrements other than mortality table into account as permitted under § 4010.8(d)(2)(i).
(ii)
Determination of XRA.
If A continues working, the earliest age A could start receiving benefit is age 55. Therefore, A's earliest retirement age at valuation (ERA) is 55. Because the earliest that A can receive an unreduced benefit is when A completed 25 years of service (at age 60), A's URA is age 60. Under the medium XRA look-up table, A's XRA is 58.
(iii)
Determination of Benefit Liabilities.
The benefit liability is the present value of A's benefit accrued as of the measurement date assuming A retires at age 58 and elects to have benefits commence immediately. Since A will not be eligible to receive unreduced benefits at that time, the accrued benefit is reduced in accordance with the plan's early retirement reduction provisions, including any subsidies to which A will be entitled under the assumption that A works until age 58.
(2)
Example 2.
Employee B is also an active participant in plan X and is age 40 with 15 years of service. B will complete 25 years of service at age 50. However, because the plan does not allow for benefit commencement before age 55, B's ERA, URA and thus, XRA are all age 55. The benefit liability is the present value of B's benefit accrued as of the measurement date assuming B retires at age 55 and elects to commence benefits immediately. Since B will be eligible to receive an unreduced benefit at that time, the full unreduced benefit amount is valued.
(3)
Example 3
—(i)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that for purposes of § 4010.8(d), the filer has decided to take pre-retirement decrements other than mortality into account as permitted under § 4010.8(d)(2)(i). Assume the only pre-retirement decrement other than mortality is turnover. The plan's turnover rates go from age 21 to age 54, and the retirement rates go from age 55 to age 65.
(ii)
Determination of XRA.
If A terminates employment at or before age 45,
A will not be eligible to receive benefits until age 65. Therefore, the portion of Employee A that is assumed to terminate before age 45 has an ERA, URA, and XRA of age 65. The portion of A that remains in service to age 45, after the application of the applicable turnover decrements, and then terminates at or after age 45, but before age 55, will be entitled to receive a reduced benefit as early as 55. Therefore, the portion of A that is assumed to terminate during this period has an ERA of 55, a URA of 65 and an XRA of 60. Since the turnover rates stop at age 55, the portion of A that remains in service to age 55 is assumed to remain in service until the XRA for that portion of A. For that portion of A, the ERA is 55, the URA is 60 and the XRA is 58. (For purposes of § 4010.8(d), the plan's assumed retirement rates are replaced by XRAs.)
(iii)
Determination of benefit liabilities.
The benefit liability of A is the sum of the present value of A's full accrued benefit at age 65 for the portion of A that terminates between age 40 and age 45, the present value of A's accrued benefit reduced for commencement at age 60 for the portion of A that terminates between age 45 and age 54, and the present value of A's accrued benefit reduced for commencement at age 58 for the portion of A that remains employed until age 55.
(4)
Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in Example 3, except that Employee B, the sole active participant, is age 40 with 15 years of service. The portion of B that is assumed to terminate before age 50 would be entitled to receive a reduced benefit as early as age 55 or an unreduced benefit at age 65. That portion of B has an ERA of 55, a URA of 65, and an XRA of 60. The benefit liability for that portion of B is the present value of B's benefit accrued as of the measurement date assuming B commences a reduced benefit at age 60. The portion of B that survives to age 50 would be entitled to receive an unreduced benefit as early as age 55. That portion of B has an ERA, URA and XRA of 55. The benefit liability for this portion of B is the present value of B's benefit accrued as of the measurement date assuming B retires and commences unreduced payments at age 55.
(f)
Multiple employer plans.
If, with respect to a multiple employer plan, the actuarial information required under this section 4010 for the plan year ending within the filer's information year has been filed under part 4010 by another filer, the filer may include this actuarial information by reference. The filer must report the name, EIN and plan number of the multiple employer plan and the name of the other filer that submitted this information.
(g)
Previous filing for plan year.
If the actuarial information for the plan year as required under this § 4010.8 has been submitted by the filer in a previous 4010 submission, the filing may include that actuarial information by reference to the previous submission.
(h)
Plans subject to special funding rules.
Instead of the requirements of paragraph (a)(11) of this section:
(1) In the case of a plan year for which a plan is subject to section 402(b) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280, dealing with certain frozen plans of commercial passenger airlines and airline caterers, the plan must meet the requirements in connection with the actuarial valuation report in accordance with instructions on PBGC's Web site,
http://www.pbgc.gov.
(2) In the case of a plan year for which the application of new funding rules is deferred for a plan under section 104 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280, as amended by the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, Public Law 111-192, dealing with eligible charity plans and plans of certain rural cooperatives, the plan must meet the requirements in paragraph (a)(5) of this section (in connection with the actuarial valuation report) in effect as of December 31, 2007.
(3) In the case of a plan year for which a plan is subject to the Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act, Public Law 113-97, dealing with certain defined benefit pension plans maintained by more than one employer, the plan must meet the requirements in connection with the
actuarial valuation report in accordance with instructions on PBGC's Web site,
http://www.pbgc.gov.

§ 4010.9
Financial information.
(a)
General.
Except as provided in this section, each filer is required to provide, in accordance with the instructions on PBGC's website,
http://www.pbgc.gov
, the following financial information for each member of the filer's controlled group (other than an exempt entity)—
(1) Audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending within the information year (including balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, and notes to the financial statements);
(2) If audited financial statements are not available by the date specified in § 4010.10(a), unaudited financial statements for the fiscal year ending within the information year; or
(3) If neither audited nor unaudited financial statements are available by the date specified in § 4010.10(a), copies of federal tax returns for the tax year ending within the information year.
(b)
Consolidated financial statements.
If the financial information of a controlled group member is combined with the information of other group members in consolidated financial statements, a filer may provide the following financial information in lieu of the information required in paragraph (a) of this section—
(1) The audited consolidated financial statements for the controlled group for the filer's information year or, if the audited consolidated financial statements are not available by the date specified in § 4010.10(a), unaudited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending within the information year; and
(2) If the ultimate parent of the controlled group is a foreign entity, financial information on the U.S. entities (other than an exempt entity) that are members of the controlled group.

§ 4010.11
Waivers.
(a)
Aggregate funding shortfall not in excess of $15 million waiver.
Unless reporting is required by § 4010.4(a)(2) or (3), reporting is waived for a person (that would be a filer if not for the waiver) for an information year if, for the plan year ending within the information year, the aggregate 4010 funding shortfall for all plans (including any exempt plans) maintained by the person's controlled group on the last day of the information year (disregarding plans with no 4010 funding shortfall) does not exceed $15 million, as determined under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1)
4010 funding shortfall; in general.
A plan's 4010 funding shortfall for a plan year equals the funding shortfall for the plan year as provided under section 303(c)(4) of ERISA and section 430(c)(4) of the Code, with the following exceptions:
(i) The funding target used to calculate the 4010 funding shortfall is determined without regard to the interest rate stabilization provisions of section 303(h)(2)(C)(iv) of ERISA and section 430(h)(2)(C)(iv) of the Code and without regard to the at-risk plan provisions in section 303(i) of ERISA and section 430(i) of the Code.
(ii) The value of plan assets used to calculate the 4010 funding shortfall is determined without regard to the reduction under section 303(f)(4)(B) of ERISA and section 430(f)(4)(B) of the Code (dealing with reduction of assets by the amount of prefunding and funding standard carryover balances).
(2)
Multiple employer plans.
For purposes of § 4010.8(c) and paragraph (a) of this section, the entire 4010 funding shortfall of any multiple employer plan of which the filer or any member of the filer's controlled group is a contributing sponsor is included.
(b)
Smaller plans waiver
—(1)
General.
Unless reporting is required by § 4010.4(a)(2) or (a)(3), reporting is waived for a person (that would be a filer if not for the waiver) for an information year if, for the plan year ending within the information year, the aggregate number of participants in all plans (including any exempt plans) maintained by the person's controlled group on the last day of the information year is fewer than 500. For this purpose, the number of participants in any plan may be determined either as of the end of the plan year ending within the information year or as of the valuation date for that plan year.
(2)
Multiple employer plans.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), the aggregate number of participants in all plans maintained by a person's controlled group includes any participants covered by a multiple employer plan in which the person participates (including participants covered by the multiple employer plan who are not or were not employed by the person).
(c)
Missed contributions resulting in a lien or outstanding minimum funding waivers.
Reporting is waived for a person (that would be a filer if not for the
waiver) for an information year if, for the plan year ending within the information year, reporting would have been required solely under § 4010.4(a)(2) or (3), provided that the missed contributions or applications for minimum funding waivers (as applicable) were reported to PBGC under part 4043 of this chapter by the due date for the 4010 filing.
(d)
Other waiver authority.
PBGC may waive the requirement to submit information with respect to one or more filers or plans or may extend the applicable due date or dates specified in § 4010.10. PBGC will exercise this discretion in appropriate cases where it finds convincing evidence supporting a waiver or extension; any waiver or extension may be subject to conditions. A request for a waiver or extension must be filed in writing with PBGC at the address provided in § 4010.10(c) no later than 15 days before the applicable due date specified in § 4010.10, and must state the facts and circumstances on which the request is based.

Alternative method of compliance for certain sponsors of multiple employer plans.
(a)
In general.
Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an eligible contributing sponsor (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) of a multiple employer plan satisfies the requirements of this part for an information year if any contributing sponsor of the multiple employer plan provides a timely filing under this part for an information year that coincides with or overlaps with the eligible contributing sponsor's information year.
(b)
PBGC request for additional information.
PBGC may request some or all of the information that would otherwise be required under this part from an eligible contributing sponsor that uses the alternative method of compliance in this section. PBGC will make such a request no earlier than the date the information would otherwise have been due. The eligible contributing sponsor must provide the requested information no later than 30 days after PBGC makes the request. The requested information need not be submitted electronically.
(c)
Eligible contributing sponsor.
For purposes of this section, an eligible contributing sponsor of a multiple employer plan is a contributing sponsor that would not be subject to reporting if the plan were disregarded in applying the gateway tests in § 4010.4(a).

# Subpart A—General Provisions; Guaranteed Benefits
§ 4022.1
Purpose and scope.
The purpose of this part is to prescribe rules governing the calculation and payment of benefits payable in terminated single-employer plans under section 4022 of ERISA. Subpart A, which applies to each plan providing benefits guaranteed under title IV of ERISA, contains definitions applicable to all subparts, and describes benefits that are guaranteed by the PBGC subject to the limitations set forth in subpart B. Subpart C is reserved for rules relating to the calculation and payment of unfunded nonguaranteed benefits under section 4022(c) of ERISA. Subpart D prescribes procedures that minimize the overpayment of benefits by plan administrators after initiating
distress terminations of single-employer plans that are not expected to be sufficient for guaranteed benefits. Subpart E sets forth the method of recoupment of benefit payments in excess of the amounts permitted under sections 4022, 4022B, and 4044 of ERISA from participants and beneficiaries in PBGC-trusteed plans, and provides for reimbursement of benefit underpayments. (The provisions of this part have not been amended to take account of changes made in section 4022 of ERISA by sections 766 and 777 of the Retirement Protection Act of 1994.)
[61 FR 34028, July 1, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 67728, Dec. 30, 1997]
§ 4022.2
Definitions.
The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: annuity, bankruptcy filing date, Code, employer, ERISA, guaranteed benefit, majority owner, mandatory employee contributions, nonforfeitable benefit, non-PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, normal retirement age, notice of intent to terminate, PBGC, person, plan, plan administrator, plan year, PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, proposed termination date, statutory hybrid plan, and title IV benefit.
In addition, for purposes of this part (unless otherwise required by the context):
Accumulated mandatory employee contributions
means mandatory employee contributions plus interest credited on those contributions under the plan, or, if greater, interest required by section 204(c) of ERISA.
Benefit in pay status
means that one or more benefit payments have been made or would have been made except for administrative delay.
Benefit increase
means any benefit arising from the adoption of a new plan or an increase in the value of benefits payable arising from an amendment to an existing plan. Such increases include, but are not limited to, a scheduled increase in benefits under a plan or plan amendment, such as a cost-of-living increase, and any change in plan provisions which advances a participant's or beneficiary's entitlement to a benefit, such as liberalized participation requirements or vesting schedules, reductions in the normal or early retirement age under a plan, an unpredictable contingent event benefit, and changes in the form of benefit payments. In the case of a plan under which the amount of benefits depends on the participant's salary and the participant receives a salary increase the resulting increase in benefits to which the participant becomes entitled will not, for the purpose of this part, be treated as a benefit increase. Similarly, in the case of a plan under which the amount of benefits depends on the participant's age or service, and the participant becomes entitled to increased benefits solely because of advancement in age or service, the increased benefits to which the participant becomes entitled will not, for the purpose of this part, be treated as a benefit increase.
Covered employment
means employment with respect to which benefits accrue under a plan.
Pension benefit
means a benefit payable as an annuity, or one or more payments related thereto, to a participant who permanently leaves or has permanently left covered employment, or to a surviving beneficiary, which payments by themselves or in combination with Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or workmen's compensation benefits provide a substantially level income to the recipient. An annuity benefit resulting from a rollover amount is a pension benefit.
Straight life annuity
means a series of level periodic payments payable for the life of the recipient, but does not include any combined annuity form, including an annuity payable for a term certain and life.
Unpredictable contingent event (UCE)
has the same meaning as unpredictable contingent event in section 206(g)(1)(C) of ERISA and Treas. Reg. § 1.436-1(j)(9) (26 CFR 1.436-1(j)(9)). It includes a plant shutdown (full or partial) or a similar event (such as a full or partial closing of another type of facility, or a layoff or other workforce reduction), or any event other than the attainment of any age, performance of any service, receipt or derivation of any compensation, or occurrence of death or disability.
Unpredictable contingent event benefit (UCEB)
has the same meaning as unpredictable contingent event benefit in section 206(g)(1)(C) of ERISA and Treas. Reg. § 1.436-1(j)(9) (26 CFR 1.436-1(j)(9)). Thus, a UCEB is any benefit or benefit increase to the extent that it would not be payable but for the occurrence of a UCE. A benefit or benefit increase that is conditioned upon the occurrence of a UCE does not cease to be a UCEB as a result of the contingent event having occurred or its occurrence having become reasonably predictable.
[61 FR 34028, July 1, 1996, as amended at 74 FR 59096, Nov. 17, 2009; 76 FR 34601, June 14, 2011; 79 FR 25672, May 6, 2014; 79 FR 70094, Nov. 25, 2014; 83 FR 49803, Oct. 3, 2018]
§ 4022.3
Guaranteed benefits.
(a)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in this part, the PBGC will guarantee the amount, as of the termination date, of a benefit provided under a plan to the extent that the benefit does not exceed the limitations in ERISA and in subpart B, if—
(1) The benefit is, on the termination date, a nonforfeitable benefit;
(2) The benefit qualifies as a pension benefit as defined in § 4022.2; and
(3) The participant is entitled to the benefit under § 4022.4.
(b)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination
—(1)
Substitution of bankruptcy filing date.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination date” each place that “termination date” appears in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
Condition for entitlement satisfied between bankruptcy filing date and termination date.
If a participant becomes entitled to a subsidized early retirement or other benefit before the termination date (or on or before the termination date, in the case of a requirement that a participant attain a particular age, earn a particular amount of service, become disabled, or die) but on or after the bankruptcy filing date (or after the bankruptcy filing date, in the case of a requirement that a participant attain a particular age, earn a particular amount of service, become disabled, or die), the subsidy or other benefit is not guaranteed because the participant had not satisfied the conditions for entitlement by the bankruptcy filing date. In such a case, the participant may have been put into pay status with the subsidized early retirement or other benefit by the plan administrator, because the plan was ongoing at the time. Even though the subsidy or other benefit is not guaranteed, the participant may be entitled to another benefit from PBGC (at that time or in the future). If so, PBGC will continue paying the participant a benefit, but in an amount reduced to reflect that the subsidy or other benefit is not guaranteed. PBGC will also allow a similarly situated participant who had not started receiving a subsidized early retirement or other benefit before PBGC became trustee of the plan to begin receiving a benefit (if the participant would have been allowed under the plan to begin receiving benefits and has reached his Earliest PBGC Retirement Date, as defined in § 4022.10), but in an amount that does not include the subsidy or other benefit.
(3)
Examples
—(i)
Vesting.
A plan provides for 5-year “cliff” vesting—
i.e.,
benefits become 100% vested when the participant completes five years of service; before the five-year mark, benefits are 0% vested. The contributing sponsor of the plan files a bankruptcy petition on November 15, 2006. The plan terminates with a termination date of December 4, 2007, and PBGC becomes statutory trustee of the plan. A participant had four years and six months of service at the bankruptcy filing date and became vested in May 2007. None of the participant's benefit is guaranteed because none of the benefit was nonforfeitable as of the bankruptcy filing date.
(ii)
Subsidized early retirement benefit.
The facts regarding the plan are the same as in Example (i) (paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section), but the plan also provides that a participant may retire from active employment at any age with a fully subsidized (
i.e.,
not actuarially reduced) early retirement benefit if he has completed 30 years of service. The plan also provides that a participant who is age 60 and has completed 20 years of service may retire from active employment with an early retirement benefit, reduced by three
percent for each year by which the participant's age at benefit commencement is less than 65. A participant was age 61 and had 29 years and 6 months of service at the bankruptcy filing date. The participant continued working for another six months, then retired as of June 1, 2007, and immediately began receiving from the plan the fully subsidized “30-and-out” early retirement benefit. PBGC will continue paying the participant a benefit, but PBGC's guarantee does not include the full subsidy for the “30-and-out” benefit, because the participant satisfied the conditions for that benefit after the bankruptcy filing date. The guarantee does include, however, the partial subsidy associated with the “60/20” early retirement benefit, because the participant satisfied the conditions for that benefit before the bankruptcy filing date.
(iii)
Accruals after bankruptcy filing date.
The facts regarding the plan are the same as in Example (i) (paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section). A participant has a vested, accrued benefit of $500 per month as of the bankruptcy filing date. At the plan's termination date, the participant has a vested, accrued benefit of $512 per month. His guaranteed benefit is limited to $500 per month—the accrued, nonforfeitable benefit as of the bankruptcy filing date.
[61 FR 34028, July 1, 1996; 61 FR 67943, Dec. 26, 1996; 76 FR 34601, June 14, 2011]
§ 4022.4
Entitlement to a benefit.
(a) A participant or his surviving beneficiary is entitled to a benefit if under the provisions of a plan:
(1) The benefit was in pay status on the termination date of the plan.
(2) The benefit is payable in an optional life-annuity form of benefit that the participant or beneficiary elected on or before the termination date of the plan or, if later, the date on which PBGC became statutory trustee of the plan.
(3) Except for a benefit described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, before the termination date (or on or before the termination date, in the case of a requirement that a participant attain a particular age, earn a particular amount of service, become disabled, or die) the participant had satisfied the conditions of the plan necessary to establish the right to receive the benefit prior to such date (prior to or on such date, in the case of a requirement that a participant attain a particular age, earn a particular amount of service, become disabled, or die) other than application for the benefit, satisfaction of a waiting period described in the plan, or retirement; or
(4) Absent an election by the participant, the benefit would be payable upon retirement.
(5) In the case of a benefit that returns all or a portion of a participant's accumulated mandatory employee contributions upon death, the participant (or beneficiary) had satisfied the conditions of the plan necessary to establish the right to the benefit other than death or designation of a beneficiary.
(b) If none of the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section is met, the PBGC will determine whether the participant is entitled to a benefit on the basis of the provisions of the plan and the circumstances of the case.
(c) In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination date” each place that “termination date” appears in paragraphs (a)(1) and (3) of this section. In making this substitution for purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the rule in § 4022.3(b)(2) (dealing with the situation where the condition for entitlement was satisfied between the bankruptcy filing date and the termination date) shall apply.
[61 FR 34028, July 1, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 16954, Apr. 8, 2002; 76 FR 34602, June 14, 2011]
§ 4022.5
Determination of nonforfeitable benefits.
(a) A guaranteed benefit payable to a surviving beneficiary is not considered to be forfeitable solely because the plan provides that the benefit will cease upon the remarriage of such beneficiary or his attaining a specified age. However, the PBGC will observe the provisions of the plan relating to the effect of such remarriage or attainment of such specified age on the surviving beneficiary's eligibility to continue to receive benefit payments.
(b) Any other provision in a plan that the right to a benefit in pay status will
cease or be suspended upon the occurrence of any specified condition does not automatically make that benefit forfeitable. In each such case the PBGC will determine whether the benefit is forfeitable.
(c) A benefit guaranteed under § 4022.6 shall not be considered forfeitable solely because the plan provides that upon recovery of the participant the benefit will cease.
§ 4022.6
Annuity payable for total disability.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an annuity which is payable (or would be payable after a waiting period described in the plan, whether or not the participant is in receipt of other benefits during such waiting period), under the terms of a plan on account of the total and permanent disability of a participant which is expected to last for the life of the participant and which began on or before the termination date is considered to be a pension benefit.
(b) In any case in which the PBGC determines that the standards for determining such total and permanent disability under a plan were unreasonable, or were modified in anticipation of termination of the plan, the disability benefits payable to a participant under such standard shall not be guaranteed unless the participant meets the standards of the Social Security Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder for determining total disability.
(c) For the purpose of this section, a participant may be required, upon the request of the PBGC, to submit to an examination or to submit proof of continued total and permanent disability. If the PBGC finds that a participant is no longer so disabled, it may suspend, modify, or discontinue the payment of the disability benefit.
(d)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination date” in paragraph (a) of this section.
[61 FR 34028, July 1, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 16954, Apr. 8, 2002; 76 FR 34602, June 14, 2011]
§ 4022.7
Benefits payable in a lump sum.
(a)
Alternative benefit.
Except as provided in this part, PBGC pays benefits only in annuity form. If a benefit that is guaranteed under this part is payable in a lump sum or substantially so under the terms of the plan, including an option elected under the plan by the participant before plan trusteeship, PBGC will not guarantee the benefit in such form. Instead, PBGC will guarantee the alternative benefit, if any, in the plan which provides for the payment of equal periodic installments for the life of the recipient. If the plan does not provide such an annuity, PBGC will guarantee an actuarially equivalent life annuity.
(b)
Payment by PBGC
—(1)
Payment in lump sum.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section:
(i)
In general.
If the lump-sum value of a benefit (or of an estimated benefit) payable by PBGC and calculated as of the termination date does not exceed the dollar amount specified in section 203(e)(1) of ERISA in effect as of the termination date and the benefit is not yet in pay status as of the date PBGC becomes trustee, the benefit (or estimated benefit) may be paid in a lump sum.
(ii)
Annuity option.
If PBGC would otherwise make a lump-sum payment in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and the monthly benefit (or the estimated monthly benefit) is equal to or greater than $25 (at normal retirement age and in the normal form for an unmarried participant), PBGC will provide the option to receive the benefit in the form of an annuity.
(iii)
Deceased participants after plan termination.
If the lump-sum value of a participant's benefit calculated as of the termination date does not exceed the dollar amount specified in section 203(e)(1) of ERISA in effect as of the termination date, and the participant dies after the plan's termination date and before the benefit is in pay status, PBGC will treat the benefit as owed to the participant at the time of death and the rules in subpart F of this part apply.
(iv)
Payment of de minimis QPSA as lump sum or annuity.
If the lump-sum
value of a participant's benefit calculated as of the termination date exceeds the dollar amount specified in section 203(e)(1) of ERISA in effect as of the termination date, the lump-sum value of annuity payments under the qualified preretirement survivor annuity (or under an estimated qualified preretirement survivor annuity) does not exceed that amount, and the participant dies after the plan's termination date and before the benefit is in pay status, then the qualified preretirement survivor annuity (or the estimated qualified preretirement survivor annuity) may be paid in a lump sum, or as an annuity, if available, and if elected by the surviving spouse.
(v)
Payments to estates.
PBGC will pay any annuity payments payable to an estate in a lump sum without regard to the threshold in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. PBGC will discount the annuity payments using the Federal mid-term rate (as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to section 1274(d)(1)(C)(ii) of the Code) applicable for the month the participant died based on monthly compounding.
(2)
Return of employee contributions
—(i)
In general.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, PBGC will pay as a lump sum instead of as an annuity, the value of the portion of an individual's basic-type benefit derived from accumulated mandatory employee contributions, if payment in a lump sum is consistent with the plan's provisions and if the individual elects such payment either before or at the time the individual starts receiving annuity payments from PBGC for the remainder of the individual's benefit. For purposes of this part, the portion of an individual's basic-type benefit derived from accumulated mandatory employee contributions is determined under § 4044.12 of this chapter (priority category 2 benefits), and the value of that portion is computed under the applicable rules contained in part 4044, subpart B of this chapter.
(ii)
Benefits in pay status.
If an individual is in pay status with an annuity as of the date the plan becomes trusteed, and if the individual did not elect to withdraw any accumulated mandatory employee contributions, PBGC will not allow the individual to withdraw any portion of the benefit derived from accumulated mandatory employee contributions as a lump sum.
(c)
Death benefits
—(1)
General.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a benefit that would otherwise be guaranteed under the provisions of this subpart, except for the fact that it is payable solely in a lump sum (or substantially so) upon the death of a participant, shall be paid by the PBGC as an annuity that has the same value as the lump sum. The PBGC will in each case determine the amount and duration of the annuity based on all the facts and circumstances.
(2)
Exception.
Except in the case of accumulated mandatory employee contributions resulting from rollover amounts (as determined under § 4044.12(c)(4)(i) of this chapter), upon the death of a participant the PBGC may pay in a lump sum (or a series of installments) that portion of the participant's accumulated mandatory employee contributions that is payable under the plan in a lump sum (or a series of installments) upon the participant's death.
(d)
Determination of lump sum amount.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section—
(1)
Benefits disregarded.
In determining whether the lump-sum value of a benefit does not exceed the dollar amount specified in section 203(e)(1) of ERISA, the PBGC may disregard the value of any benefits the plan or the PBGC previously paid in lump-sum form or the plan paid by purchasing an annuity contract, the value of any benefits returned under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and the value of any benefits the PBGC has not yet determined under section 4022(c) of ERISA.
(2)
Actuarial assumptions.
PBGC will calculate the lump sum value of a benefit by valuing the monthly annuity benefits payable in the form determined under § 4044.51(a) of this chapter and commencing at the time determined under § 4044.51(b) of this chapter. The actuarial assumptions used will be those described in § 4044.52 of this chapter, except as follows:
(i)
Loading for expenses.
There will be no adjustment to reflect the loading for expenses.
(ii)
Mortality assumption.
The “applicable mortality table” specified in section 205(g)(3)(B)(i) of ERISA and section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code for the year containing the termination date will apply.
(iii)
Interest rate assumption.
The “applicable interest rate” specified in section 205(g)(3)(B)(ii) of ERISA and section 417(e)(3)(C) of the Code for the month containing the termination date will apply.
(iv)
Date for determining lump sum value.
The date as of which a lump sum value is calculated is the termination date, except that in the case of a subsequent insufficiency it is the date described in section 4062(b)(1)(B) of ERISA.
(e)
Private-sector lump sum rates.
PBGC provides lump sum interest rates for private-sector payments in appendix C to this part.
[61 FR 34028, July 1, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 38306, July 16, 1998; 65 FR 14752, 14755, Mar. 17, 2000; 67 FR 16954, Apr. 8, 2002; 79 FR 70094, Nov. 25, 2014; 85 FR 55591, Sept. 9, 2020; 88 FR 44051, July 11, 2023]
§ 4022.8
Form of payment.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in § 4022.7 (relating to the payment of lump sums), the PBGC will pay benefits—
(1) In the automatic PBGC form described in paragraph (b) of this section; or
(2) If an optional PBGC form described in paragraph (c) of this section is elected, in that optional form.
(b)
Automatic PBGC form
—(1)
Participants
—(i)
Married participants.
The automatic PBGC form with respect to a participant who is married at the time the benefit enters pay status is the form a married participant would be entitled to receive from the plan in the absence of an election.
(ii)
Unmarried participants.
The automatic PBGC form with respect to a participant who is unmarried at the time the benefit enters pay status is the form an unmarried person would be entitled to receive from the plan in the absence of an election.
(2)
Beneficiaries
—(i)
QPSA beneficiaries.
The automatic PBGC form with respect to the spouse of a married participant in a plan with a termination date on or after August 23, 1984, who dies before his or her benefit enters pay status is the qualified preretirement survivor annuity such a spouse would be entitled to receive from the plan in the absence of an election. The PBGC will not charge the participant or beneficiary for this survivor benefit coverage for the time period beginning on the plan's termination date (regardless of whether the plan would have charged).
(ii)
Alternate payees.
The automatic PBGC form with respect to an alternate payee with a separate interest under a qualified domestic relations order is the form an unmarried participant would be entitled to receive from the plan in the absence of an election.
(c)
Optional PBGC forms
—(1)
Participant and beneficiary elections.
A participant may elect any optional form described in paragraphs (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section. A beneficiary described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section (a QPSA beneficiary or an alternate payee) may elect any optional form described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iv) of this section.
(2)
Permitted designees.
A participant or beneficiary, whether married or unmarried, who elects an optional form with a survivor feature (e.g., a 5-year certain-and-continuous annuity or, in the case of a participant, a joint-and-50%-survivor annuity) may designate either a spouse or a non-spouse beneficiary to receive survivor benefits. An optional joint-life form must be payable to a natural person or (with the consent of the PBGC) to a trust for the benefit of one or more natural persons.
(3)
Spousal consent.
In the case of a participant who is married at the time the benefit enters pay status, the election of an optional form or the designation of a non-spouse beneficiary is valid only if the participant's spouse consents.
(4)
Permitted optional single-life forms.
The PBGC may offer benefits in the following single-life forms:
(i) A straight-life annuity;
(ii) A 5-year certain-and-continuous annuity;
(iii) A 10-year certain-and-continuous annuity;
(iv) A 15-year certain-and-continuous annuity; and
(v) The form an unmarried person would be entitled to receive from the plan in the absence of an election.
(5)
Permitted optional joint-life forms.
The PBGC may offer benefits in the following joint-life forms:
(i) A joint-and-50%-survivor annuity;
(ii) A joint-and-50%-survivor-“pop-up” annuity (
i.e.,
where the participant's benefit “pops up” to the unreduced level if the beneficiary dies first);
(iii) A joint-and-75%-survivor annuity; and
(iv) A joint-and-100%-survivor annuity.
(6)
Determination of benefit amount; starting benefit.
To determine the amount of the benefit in an optional PBGC form—
(i)
Single-life forms.
In the case of an optional PBGC form under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the PBGC will first determine the amount of the benefit in the form the plan would pay to an unmarried participant in the absence of an election.
(ii)
Joint-life forms.
In the case of an optional PBGC form under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the PBGC will first determine the amount of the benefit in the form the plan would pay to a married participant in the absence of an election. For this purpose, the PBGC will treat a participant who designates a non-spouse beneficiary as being married to a person who is the same age as that non-spouse beneficiary.
(7)
Determination of benefit amount; conversion factors.
The PBGC will convert the benefit amount determined under paragraph (c)(6) of this section to the optional form elected, using PBGC factors based on—
(i)
Mortality.
Unisex mortality rates that are a fixed blend of 50 percent of the male mortality rates and 50 percent of the female mortality rates from the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table as prescribed in Rev. Rul. 95-6, 1995-1 C.B. 80 (Internal Revenue Service Cumulative Bulletins are available from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402); and
(ii)
Interest.
An interest rate of six percent.
(8)
Determination of benefit amount; limitation.
The PBGC will limit the benefit amount determined under paragraph (c)(7) of this section to the amount of the benefit it would pay in the form of a straight life annuity under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
(9)
Incidental benefits.
The PBGC will not pay an optional PBGC form with a death benefit (e.g., a joint-and-50%-survivor annuity) unless the death benefit would be an “incidental death benefit” under 26 CFR 1.401-1(b)(1)(i). If the death benefit would not be an “incidental death benefit,” the PBGC may instead offer a modified version of the optional form under which the death benefit would be an “incidental death benefit.”
(d)
Change in benefit form.
Subject to benefit changes that PBGC may prescribe under § 4022.9(d), once payment of a benefit starts, the benefit form cannot be changed, regardless of whether the participant or beneficiary was put into pay status by the plan before the date PBGC becomes trustee of the plan.
(e)
PBGC discretion.
The PBGC may make other optional annuity forms available subject to the rules in paragraph (c) of this section.
(f)
Rollover amounts.
The annuity benefit resulting from rollover amounts (as determined under § 4044.12(c)(4) of this chapter) is combined with any other benefit under the plan and paid in the same form and at the same time as the other benefit.
[67 FR 16954, Apr. 8, 2002, as amended at 79 FR 70095, Nov. 25, 2014; 88 FR 44052, July 11, 2023]
§ 4022.9
Time of payment; benefit applications and corrections.
(a)
Time of payment.
A participant may start receiving an annuity benefit from the PBGC (subject to the PBGC's rules for starting benefit payments) on his or her Earliest PBGC Retirement Date as determined under § 4022.10 of this subchapter or, if later, the plan's termination date.
(b)
Elections and consents.
The PBGC may prescribe the time and manner for benefit elections to be made and spousal consents to be provided.
(c)
Benefit applications.
The PBGC is not required to accept any application for benefits not made in accordance with its forms and instructions.
(d)
Benefit corrections.
PBGC may prescribe the time and manner for corrections of errors that affect benefit form and benefit starting dates and for changes in benefit form to mitigate the consequences of a Presidentially declared disaster.
(e)
Filing with the PBGC
—(1)
Method and date of filing.
The PBGC applies the rules in subpart A of part 4000 of this chapter to determine permissible methods of filing with the PBGC under this part. Benefit applications and related submissions are treated as filed on the date received by the PBGC unless the instructions for the applicable form provide for an earlier date. Subpart C of part 4000 of this chapter provides rules for determining when the PBGC receives a submission.
(2)
Where to file.
See § 4000.4 of this chapter for information on where to file.
(3)
Computation of time.
The PBGC applies the rules in subpart D of part 4000 of this chapter to compute any time period for filing under this part.
[67 FR 16955, Apr. 8, 2002, as amended at 68 FR 61353, Oct. 28, 2003; 88 FR 44052, July 11, 2023]
§ 4022.10
Earliest PBGC Retirement Date.
The Earliest PBGC Retirement Date for a participant is the earliest date on which the participant could retire under plan provisions for purposes of section 4044(a)(3)(B) of ERISA. The Earliest PBGC Retirement Date is determined in accordance with this § 4022.10. For purposes of this § 4022.10, “age” means the participant's age as of his or her last birthday (unless otherwise required by the context).
(a)
Immediate annuity at or after age 55.
If the earliest date on which a participant could separate from service with the right to receive an immediate annuity is on or after the date the participant reaches age 55, the Earliest PBGC Retirement Date for the participant is the earliest date on which the participant could separate from service with the right to receive an immediate annuity.
(b)
Immediate annuity before age 55.
If the earliest date on which a participant could separate from service with the right to receive an immediate annuity is before the date the participant reaches age 55, the Earliest PBGC Retirement Date for the participant is the date the participant reaches age 55 (except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section).
(c)
Facts and circumstances.
If a participant could separate from service with the right to receive an immediate annuity before the date the participant reaches age 55, the PBGC will make a determination, under the facts and circumstances, as to whether the participant could retire under plan provisions for purposes of section 4044(a)(3)(B) of ERISA on an earlier date. If the PBGC determines, under the facts and circumstances, that the participant could retire under plan provisions for those purposes on an earlier date, that earlier date is the Earliest PBGC Retirement Date for the participant. In making this determination, the PBGC will take into account plan provisions (e.g., the general structure of the provisions, the extent to which the benefit is subsidized, and whether eligibility for the benefit is based on a substantial service or age-and-service requirement), the age at which employees customarily retire (under the particular plan or in the particular company or industry, as appropriate), and all other relevant considerations. Neither a plan's reference to a separation from service at a particular age as a “retirement” nor the ability of a participant to receive an immediate annuity at a particular age necessarily makes the date the participant reaches that age the Earliest PBGC Retirement Date for the participant. The Earliest PBGC Retirement Date determined by the PBGC under this paragraph (c) will never be earlier than the earliest date the participant could separate from service with the right to receive an immediate annuity.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the operation of the rules in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
(1)
Normal retirement age.
A plan's normal retirement age is age 65. The plan does not offer a consensual lump
sum or an immediate annuity upon separation before normal retirement age. The Earliest PBGC Retirement Date for a participant who, as of the plan's termination date, is age 50 is the date the participant reaches age 65.
(2)
Early retirement age.
A plan's normal retirement age is age 65. The plan specifies an early retirement age of 60 with 10 years of service. The plan does not offer a consensual lump sum or an immediate annuity upon separation before early retirement age. The Earliest PBGC Retirement Date for a participant who, as of the plan's termination date, is age 55 and has completed 10 years of service is the date the participant reaches age 60.
(3)
Separation at any age.
A plan's normal retirement age is age 65. The plan specifies an early retirement age of 60 but offers an immediate annuity upon separation regardless of age. The Earliest PBGC Retirement Date for a participant who, as of the plan's termination date, is age 35 is the date the participant reaches age 55, unless the PBGC determines under the facts and circumstances that the participant could “retire” for purposes of ERISA section 4044(a)(3)(B) on an earlier date, in which case the participant's Earliest PBGC Retirement Date would be that earlier date.
(4)
Age 50 retirement common.
A plan's normal retirement age is age 60. The plan specifies an early retirement age of 50 but offers an immediate annuity upon separation regardless of age. The Earliest PBGC Retirement Date for a participant who, as of the plan's termination date, is age 35 is the date the participant reaches age 55, unless the PBGC determines under the facts and circumstances that the participant could retire for purposes of ERISA section 4044(a)(3)(B) on an earlier date, in which case the Earliest PBGC Retirement Date would be that earlier date. For example, if it were common for participants to retire at age 50, the PBGC could determine that the participant's Earliest PBGC Retirement Date would be the date the participant reached age 50.
(5)
“30-and-out” benefit.
A plan's normal retirement age is age 65. The plan offers an immediate annuity upon separation regardless of age and a fully-subsidized annuity upon separation with 30 years of service. The Earliest PBGC Retirement Date for a participant who, as of the plan's termination date, is age 48 and has completed 30 years of service is the date the participant reaches age 55, unless the PBGC determines under the facts and circumstances that the participant could retire for purposes of ERISA section 4044(a)(3)(B) on an earlier date, in which case the participant's Earliest PBGC Retirement Date would be that earlier date. In this example, the PBGC generally would determine under the facts and circumstances that the participant's Earliest PBGC Retirement Date is the date the participant completed 30 years of service.
(6)
Typical airline pilots' plan.
An airline pilots' plan has a normal retirement age of 60. The plan specifies an early retirement age of 50 (with 5 years of service). The Earliest PBGC Retirement Date for a participant who, as of the plan's termination date, is age 48 and has completed five years of service would be the date the participant reaches age 55, unless the PBGC determines under the facts and circumstances that the participant could retire for purposes of ERISA section 4044(a)(3)(B) on an earlier date, in which case the participant's Earliest PBGC Retirement Date would be that earlier date. In this example, the PBGC generally would determine under the facts and circumstances that the participant's Earliest PBGC Retirement Date is the date the participant reaches age 50. If the plan instead had provided for early retirement before age 50, the PBGC would consider all the facts and circumstances (including the plan's normal retirement age and the age at which employees customarily retire in the airline industry) in determining whether to treat the date the participant reaches the plan's early retirement age as the participant's Earliest PBGC Retirement Date.
(e)
Special rule for “window” provisions.
For purposes of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the PBGC will treat a participant as being able, under plan provisions, to separate from service with the right to receive an immediate annuity on a date before the plan's termination date only if—
(1) Eligibility for that immediate annuity continues through the earlier of—
(i) The plan's termination date; or
(ii) The date the participant actually separates from service with the right to receive an immediate annuity; and
(2) The participant satisfies the conditions for eligibility for that immediate annuity on or before the plan's termination date.
[67 FR 16955, Apr. 8, 2002]
§ 4022.11
Guarantee of benefits relating to uniformed service.
This section applies to a benefit of a participant who becomes reemployed after service in the uniformed services that is covered by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA).
(a) A benefit described in paragraph (b) of this section that would satisfy the requirements of § 4022.3(a) and (c) (together with any benefit earned for the period preceding military service) except for the fact that the participant was not reemployed on or before the termination date will be deemed to satisfy those requirements if PBGC determines, based upon a demonstration by the participant or otherwise, that he or she became reemployed after the termination date and entitled to the benefit under USERRA.
(b) A benefit described in this paragraph (b) is a benefit attributable to a period of service commencing before the termination date and ending on the termination date during which the participant was serving in the uniformed services as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4303(13) (or was in a subsequent reemployment eligibility period) and to which the participant is entitled under USERRA.
(c)
Example:
A plan's vesting requirement is 5 years of service with the employer. A participant has completed 4 years of service when he leaves employment for uniformed service. The plan terminates while the participant is in military service. As of the termination date, the participant would have had 5 years of service and 5 years of benefit accruals if he had remained continuously employed. Upon reemployment after the termination date but within the time limits set by USERRA, the participant would have had 6 years of service under the plan for vesting and benefit accrual purposes, if the plan had not terminated. PBGC would treat the participant as having a vested, nonforfeitable plan benefit with 5 years of vesting service and benefit accruals as of the termination date.
(d) In the case of a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination date” each place that “termination date” appears in this section.
[74 FR 59096, Nov. 17, 2009]

# Subpart B—Limitations on Guaranteed Benefits
§ 4022.21
Limitations; in general.
(a)(1) Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section, the PBGC will not guarantee that part of an installment payment that exceeds the dollar amount payable as a straight life annuity commencing at normal retirement age, or thereafter, to which a participant would have been entitled under the provisions of the plan in effect on the termination date, on the basis of his credited service to such date. If the plan does not provide a straight life annuity either as its normal form of retirement benefit or as an option to the normal form, the PBGC will for purposes of this paragraph convert the plan's normal form benefit to a straight life annuity of equal actuarial value as determined by the PBGC.
(2) The limitation of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply to:
(i) A survivor's benefit payable as an annuity on account of the death of a participant that occurred on or before the plan's termination date and before the participant retired;
(ii) A disability pension described in § 4022.6 of this part; or
(iii) A benefit payable in non-level installments that in combination with Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or workman's compensation benefits yields a substantially level income if the projected income from the plan benefit over the expected life of the recipient does not exceed the value of the straight life annuity described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b) The PBGC will not guarantee the payment of that part of any benefit that exceeds the limitations in section 4022(b) of ERISA and this subpart B.
(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the PBGC does not guarantee a benefit payable in a lump sum (or substantially so) upon the death of a participant or his surviving beneficiary unless that benefit is substantially derived from a reduction in the pension benefit payable to the participant or surviving beneficiary.
(2) Paragraphs (a) and (c)(1) of this section do not apply to that portion of accumulated mandatory employee contributions payable under a plan upon the death of a participant, and such a benefit is a pension benefit for purposes of this part.
(d) The PBGC will not guarantee a joint-life annuity benefit payable to other than—
(1) Natural persons; or
(2) A trust or estate for the benefit of one or more natural persons.
(e)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination
—(1)
Substitution of bankruptcy filing date.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination date” each place that “termination date” appears in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(2)
Examples
—(i)
Straight-life annuity.
A plan provides for normal retirement at age 65. If a participant terminates employment at or after age 55 with 25 years of service, the plan will pay an unreduced early retirement benefit, plus a temporary supplement of $400 per month until the participant reaches age 62. When the plan's contributing sponsor files a bankruptcy petition in 2008, a participant who is still working has a vested, accrued benefit of $1,500 per month (as a straight-life annuity) and has satisfied the age and service requirements for the unreduced early retirement benefit. The participant retires eight months later, when his vested, accrued benefit is $1,530 per month (as a straight-life annuity). He elects to receive his benefit as a straight-life annuity, and begins receiving a total benefit of $1,930: His $1,530 accrued benefit plus the $400 temporary supplement. The plan terminates six months later, during the sponsor's bankruptcy. No Title IV limitations apply to the participant's benefit, other than the limitation in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. PBGC will guarantee $1,500, the amount of the participant's accrued benefit (as a straight-life annuity) as of the bankruptcy filing date.
(ii)
Joint-and-survivor annuity.
The facts are the same as Example (i) (paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section), except that the participant elects to receive his benefit as a 50% joint-and-survivor annuity. Before plan termination, the participant was receiving a total benefit of $1,777: His $1,530 accrued benefit, reduced by 10% for the survivor benefit, plus the $400 temporary supplement. From the termination date until the participant reaches age 62, PBGC will guarantee $1,500: The $1,500 accrued benefit (as a straight-life annuity) as of the bankruptcy filing date, reduced to $1,350 to reflect the 10% reduction for the survivor benefit, plus $150 of the temporary supplement that, in combination with the $1,350, does not exceed the $1,500 accrued-at-normal limit. When the participant reaches age 62, his guaranteed benefit is reduced to $1,350, because under plan provisions the temporary supplement ceases at that time.
[61 FR 34028, July 1, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 16956, Apr. 8, 2002; 76 FR 34602, June 14, 2011; 88 FR 44052, July 11, 2023]
§ 4022.22
Maximum guaranteeable benefit.
(a)
In general.
Subject to section 4022B of ERISA and part 4022B of this chapter, and except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan shall be guaranteed only to the extent that such benefits do not exceed the actuarial value of a benefit in the form of a life annuity payable in monthly installments, commencing at age 65, equal to the lesser of—
(1) One-twelfth of the participant's average annual gross income from his employer during either his highest-paid five consecutive calendar years in which he was an active participant under the plan, or if he was not an active participant throughout the entire
such period, the lesser number of calendar years within that period in which he was an active participant under the plan; or
(2) $750 multiplied by the fraction x/$13,200 where “x” is the Social Security contribution and benefit base determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act in effect at the termination date of the plan.
(b)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination—
(1) The five-year period described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not include any calendar years that end after the bankruptcy filing date.
(2) “Bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination date of the plan” in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Example: A contributing sponsor files a bankruptcy petition in 2007. The sponsor's plan terminates in a distress termination with a termination date in 2008. PBGC will compute participants' maximum guaranteeable benefits based on the amount determined under paragraph (a)(2) for 2007 ($4,125.00 as a straight-life annuity starting at age 65).
(c)
Gross income.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section—
(1) Gross income means “earned income” as defined in section 911(d)(2) of the Code, determined without regard to any community property laws.
(2) If the plan is one to which more than one employer contributes, and during any calendar year the participant received gross income from more than one such contributing employer, then the amounts so received shall be aggregated in determining the participant's gross income for the calendar year.
(d)
Rollover amounts.
Any portion of a benefit derived from mandatory employee contributions resulting from rollover amounts (as determined under § 4044.12(c)(4)(i) of this chapter) is disregarded in applying the provisions of §§ 4022.22 and 4022.23. However, any portion of a benefit derived from employer contributions resulting from rollover amounts (as determined under § 4044.12(c)(4)(ii) of this chapter) is combined with any other benefit under the plan for purposes of determining the maximum guaranteeable benefit under §§ 4022.22 and 4022.23. For example, assume that a participant has an $80,000 total annual plan benefit at age 65, of which $15,000 is derived from mandatory employee contributions resulting from rollover amounts and $5,000 is derived from employer contributions resulting from rollover amounts. The $15,000 benefit derived from employee contributions resulting from rollover amounts would be excluded in the determination of the participant's maximum guaranteeable amount. The participant's remaining $65,000 benefit (including the $5,000 benefit derived from employer contributions resulting from rollover amounts) would be subject to the maximum guaranteeable benefit limitation. Assuming the plan terminated in 2014, the participant's maximum guaranteeable benefit of approximately $59,000 for a straight life annuity at age 65 would effectively be increased by the $15,000 benefit derived from employee contributions resulting from rollover amounts, resulting in total guaranteeable benefits of approximately $74,000. (The maximum guaranteeable benefit limitation would apply to the participant's benefit derived from employer contributions; as a result, $6,000 of the participant's benefit derived from employer contributions would not be guaranteeable by PBGC.)
[76 FR 34602, June 14, 2011, as amended at 79 FR 70095, Nov. 25, 2014]
§ 4022.23
Computation of maximum guaranteeable benefits.
(a)
General.
Where a benefit is payable in any manner other than as a monthly benefit payable for life commencing at age 65, the maximum guaranteeable monthly amount of such benefit shall be computed by applying the applicable factor or factors set forth in paragraphs (c)-(e) of this section to the monthly amount computed under § 4022.22. In the case of a step-down life annuity, the maximum guaranteeable monthly amount of such benefit shall be computed in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
(b)
Application of adjustment factors to monthly amount computed under § 4022.22.
(1) Each percentage increase or decrease computed under paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section shall be
added to or subtracted from a base of 1.00, and the resulting amounts shall be multiplied.
(2) The monthly amount computed under § 4022.22 shall be multiplied by the product computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section in order to determine the participant's and/or beneficiary's maximum benefit guaranteeable.
(c)
Annuitant's age factor.
If a participant or the beneficiary of a deceased participant is entitled to and chooses to receive his benefit at an age younger than 65, the monthly amount computed under § 4022.22 shall be reduced by the following amounts for each month up to the number of whole months below age 65 that corresponds to the later of the participant's age at the termination date or his age at the time he begins to receive the benefit: For each of the 60 months immediately preceding the 65th birthday, the reduction shall be
7/12
of 1%; For each of the 60 months immediately preceding the 60th birthday, the reduction shall be
4/12
of 1%; For each of the 120 months immediately preceding the 55th birthday, the reduction shall be
2/12
of 1%; and For each succeeding 120 months period, the monthly percentage reduction shall be
1/2
of that used for the preceding 120 month period.
(d)
Factor for benefit payable in a form other than as a life annuity.
When a benefit is in a form other than a life annuity payable in monthly installments, the monthly amount computed under § 4022.22 shall be adjusted by the appropriate factors on a case-by-case basis by PBGC. This paragraph sets forth the adjustment factors to be used for several common benefit forms payable in monthly installments.
(1)
Period certain and continuous annuity.
A period certain and continuous annuity means an annuity which is payable in periodic installments for the participant's life, but for not less than a specified period of time whether or not the participant dies during that period. The monthly amount of a period certain and continuous annuity computed under § 4022.22 shall be reduced by the following amounts for each month of the period certain subsequent to the termination date:
For each month up to 60 months deduct
1/24
of 1%;
For each month beyond 60 months deduct
1/12
of 1%.
(i) A cash refund annuity means an annuity under which if the participant dies prior to the time when he has received pension payments equal to a fixed sum specified in the plan, then the balance is paid as a lump-sum death benefit. A cash refund annuity shall be treated as a benefit payable for a period certain and continuous. The period of certainty shall be computed by dividing the amount of the lump-sum refund by the monthly amount to which the participant is entitled under the terms of the plan.
(ii) An installment refund annuity means an annuity under which if the participant dies prior to the time he has received pension payments equal to a fixed sum specified in the plan, then the balance is paid as a death benefit in periodic installments equal in amount to the participant's periodic benefit. An installment refund annuity shall be treated as a benefit payable for a period certain and continuous. The period of certainty shall be computed by dividing the amount of the remaining refund by the monthly amount to which the participant is entitled under the terms of the plan.
(2)
Joint and survivor annuity (contingent basis).
A joint and survivor annuity (contingent basis) means an annuity which is payable in periodic installments to a participant for his life and upon his death is payable to his beneficiary for the beneficiary's life in the same or in a reduced amount. The monthly amount of a joint and survivor annuity (contingent basis) computed under § 4022.22 shall be reduced by an amount equal to 10% plus
2/10
of 1% for each percentage point in excess of 50% of the participant's benefit that will continue to be paid to the beneficiary. If the benefit payable to the beneficiary is less than 50 percent of the participant's benefit, PBGC shall provide the adjustment factors to be used.
(3)
Joint and survivor annuity (joint basis).
A joint and survivor annuity (joint basis) means an annuity which is payable in periodic installments to a participant and upon his death or the
death of his beneficiary is payable to the survivor for the survivor's life in the same or in a reduced amount. The monthly amount of a joint and survivor annuity (joint basis) computed under § 4022.22 shall be reduced by an amount equal to
4/10
of 1% for each percentage point in excess of 50% of the participant's original benefit that will continue to be paid to the survivor. If the benefit payable to the survivor is less than 50 percent of the participant's original benefit, PBGC shall provide the adjustment factors to be used.
(e) When a benefit is payable in a form described in paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section, and the beneficiary's age is different from the participant's age, by 15 years or less, the monthly amount computed under § 4022.22 shall be adjusted by the following amounts: If the beneficiary is younger than the participant, deduct 1% for each year of the age difference; If the beneficiary is older than the participant, add
1/2
of 1% for each year of the age difference. In computing the difference in ages, years over 65 years of age shall not be counted. If the difference in age between the beneficiary and the participant is greater than 15 years, PBGC shall provide the adjustment factors to be used.
(f)
Step-down life annuity.
A step-down life annuity means an annuity payable in a certain amount for the life of the participant plus a temporary additional amount payable until the participant attains an age specified in the plan.
(1) The temporary additional amount payable under a step-down life annuity shall be converted to a life annuity payable in monthly installments by multiplying the appropriate factor based on the participant's age and the number of remaining years of the temporary additional benefit by the amount of the temporary additional benefit. The factors to be used are set forth in the table below. The amount of the monthly benefit so calculated shall be added to the level amount of the monthly benefit payable for life to determine the level-life annuity that is equivalent to the step-down life annuity.

If the benefit is payable for less than 1 yr, the appropriate factor is obtained by multiplying the factor for 1 yr by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months the benefit is payable, and the denominator of which is 12. If the benefit is payable for 1 or more whole years, plus an additional number of months less than 12, the appropriate factor is obtained by linear interpolation between the factor for the number of whole years the benefit is payable and the factor for the next year.
(2) If a participant is entitled to and chooses to receive a step-down life annuity at an age younger than 65, the monthly amount computed under § 4022.22 shall be adjusted by applying the factors set forth in paragraph (c) of
this section in the manner described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(3) If the level-life monthly benefit calculated pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section exceeds the monthly amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section, then the monthly maximum benefit guaranteeable shall be a step-down life annuity under which the monthly amount of the temporary additional benefit and the amount of the monthly benefit payable for life, respectively, shall bear the same ratio to the monthly amount of the temporary additional benefit and the monthly benefit payable for life provided under the plan, respectively, as the monthly benefit calculated pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section bears to the monthly benefit calculated pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(g)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
(1) In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, except as provided in the next sentence, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination date” and “date of plan termination” each place that “termination date” or “date of plan termination” appears in paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of this section. In any case in which an event (such as the death of a participant or beneficiary who was alive on the bankruptcy filing date) that affects who is receiving or will receive a benefit from PBGC has occurred on or before the termination date, PBGC will determine the factors in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) based on the form of benefit that was being paid (or was payable) and the person who was receiving or was entitled to receive the benefit from PBGC as of the termination date. (The case of Participant C in the example below illustrates this exception.)
(2)
Example
—(i)
Facts.
The contributing sponsor of a plan files a bankruptcy petition in July 2007, and the sponsor's plan terminates in a PBGC-initiated termination with a termination date in July 2008. At the bankruptcy filing date:
(A) Participant A was age 64 and receiving a benefit from the plan in the form of a 10-year certain-and-continuous annuity, with 4 years remaining in the certain period.
(B) Participant B was age 60 and 6 months and was still working. She began receiving a benefit from the plan in the form of a 50% joint-and-survivor annuity when she turned 61 in January 2008. Her spouse was the same age as she.
(C) Participant C was age 60 and was receiving a $3,000/month benefit from the plan in the form of a 50% joint-and-survivor annuity, with his spouse, age 58, as his beneficiary. Participant C he died in February 2008 and in March 2008 his spouse began receiving a 50% survivor annuity of $1,500/month.
(D) Participant D was age 59 and was still working; he began receiving a straight-life annuity from the PBGC in July 2010 when he was 62 years old.
(ii)
Conclusions.
In accordance with § 4022.22(b)(2), PBGC computes the maximum guaranteeable monthly benefit for Participants A, B, and D and for the spouse of Participant C based on the $4,125.00 amount determined under § 4022.22(a)(2) for 2007. (The gross-income-based limitation in § 4022.22(a)(1) does not apply to any of these participants.)
(A) Participant A's maximum guaranteeable monthly benefit is $3,759.53 [$4,125.00 × .93 (7% reduction for a benefit starting at age 64) × .98 (2% reduction for a certain-and-continuous annuity with 4 years remaining in the certain period)].
(B) Participant B's maximum guaranteeable monthly benefit is $2,673.00 [$4,125.00 × .72 (28% reduction for a benefit starting at age 61) × .90 (10% reduction due to the 50% joint-and-survivor feature)].
(C) Participant C's spouse's maximum guaranteeable monthly benefit is $2,351.25 [$4,125.00 × .57 (43% reduction for a benefit starting at age 58; no reduction for the form of benefit because the spouse's survivor benefit is a straight-life annuity)]. Because that amount exceeds the spouse's $1,500 monthly survivor benefit, the spouse's benefit is not reduced by the maximum guaranteeable benefit limitation.
(D) Participant D's maximum guaranteeable monthly benefit is $3,258.75 [$4,125.00 × .79 (21% reduction for a benefit starting at age 62)].

§ 4022.24
Benefit increases.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies to all benefit increases, as defined in § 4022.2, that have been in effect for less than five years preceding the termination date.
(b)
General rule.
Benefit increases described in paragraph (a) of this section are guaranteeable only to the extent provided in § 4022.25.
(c)
Computation of guaranteeable benefit increases.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section pertaining to multiple benefit increases, the amount of a guaranteeable benefit increase shall be the amount, if any, by which the monthly benefit calculated pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section (the monthly benefit provided under the terms of the plan as of the termination date, as limited by § 4022.22) exceeds the monthly benefit calculated pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section (the monthly benefit which would have been payable on the termination date if the benefit provided subsequent to the increase were equivalent, as of the date of the increase, to the benefit provided prior to the increase).
(1) Determine the amount of the monthly benefit payable on the termination date (or, in the case of a deferred benefit, the monthly benefit which will become payable thereafter) under the terms of the plan subsequent to the increase, using service credited to the participant as of the termination date, that is guaranteeable pursuant to § 4022.22;
(2) Determine, as of the date of the benefit increase, in accordance with the provisions of § 4022.23, the factors which would be used to calculate the monthly maximum benefit guaranteeable (i) under the terms of the plan prior to the increase and (ii) under the terms of the plan subsequent to the increase. However, when the benefit referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is a joint and survivor benefit deferred as of the termination date and there is no beneficiary on that date, the factors computed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section shall be determined as if the benefit were payable only to the participant. Each set of factors determined under this paragraph shall be stated in the manner set forth in § 4022.23(b)(1);
(3) Multiply the monthly benefit which would have been payable (or, in the case of a deferred benefit, would have become payable) under the terms of the plan prior to the increase based on service credited to the participant as of the termination date by a fraction, the numerator of which is the product of the factors computed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and the denominator of which is the product of the factors computed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(4) Calculate the amount of the monthly benefit which would be payable on the termination date if the monthly benefit computed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section had been payable commencing on the date of the benefit increase (or, in the case of a deferred benefit, would have become payable thereafter). In the case of a benefit which does not become payable until subsequent to the termination date, the amount of the monthly benefit determined pursuant to this paragraph is the same as the amount of the monthly benefit calculated pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(d)
Multiple benefit increases.
(1) Where there has been more than one benefit increase described in paragraph (a) of this section, the amounts of guaranteeable benefit increases shall be calculated beginning with the earliest increase, and each such amount (except for the amount resulting from the final benefit increase) shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the product of the factors, stated in the manner set forth in § 4022.23(b)(1), used to calculate the monthly maximum guaranteeable benefit under § 4022.22 and the denominator of which is the product of the factors used in the calculation under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(2) Each benefit increase shall be treated separately for the purposes of § 4022.25, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of that section, and for the purposes of § 4022.26, as appropriate.
(e) Except as provided in § 4022.27(c), for the purposes of §§ 4022.22 through 4022.28, a benefit increase is deemed to
be in effect commencing on the later of its adoption date or its effective date.
(f)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, except as provided in the next sentence, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination date” each place that “termination date” appears in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section. In any case in which an event (such as the death of a participant or beneficiary who was alive on the bankruptcy filing date) that affects who is receiving or will receive a benefit from PBGC has occurred on or before the termination date, PBGC will compute the benefit based on the form of benefit that was being paid (or was payable) and the person who was receiving or was entitled to receive the benefit from PBGC as of the termination date, consistent with § 4022.23(g).
(g)
Rollover amounts.
Any portion of a benefit derived from mandatory employee contributions resulting from rollover amounts (as determined under § 4044.12 (c)(4)(i) of this chapter) is disregarded in applying the provisions of §§ 4022.24 through 4022.26. However, any portion of a benefit derived from employer contributions resulting from rollover amounts (as determined under § 4044.12(c)(4)(ii) of this chapter) is combined with any other benefit under the plan in applying the provisions of §§ 4022.24 through 4022.26. In such case, the benefit increase is deemed to be in effect on the date the rollover amounts are received by the plan.
[61 FR 34028, July 1, 1996; 61 FR 36626, July 12, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 67728, Dec. 30, 1997; 76 FR 34603, June 14, 2011; 79 FR 25672, May 6, 2014; 79 FR 70095, Nov. 25, 2014; 83 FR 49803, Oct. 3, 2018]
§ 4022.25
Five-year phase-in of benefit guarantee.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies to the guarantee of benefit increases which have been in effect for less than five years.
(b)
Phase-in formula.
The amount of a benefit increase computed pursuant to § 4022.24 shall be guaranteed to the extent provided in the following formula: the number of years the benefit increase has been in effect, not to exceed five, multiplied by the greater of (1) 20 percent of the amount computed pursuant to § 4022.24; or (2) $20 per month.
(c)
Computation of years.
In computing the number of years a benefit increase has been in effect, each complete 12-month period ending on or before the termination date during which such benefit increase was in effect constitutes one year.
(d)
Multiple benefit increases.
In applying the formula contained in paragraph (b) of this section, multiple benefit increases within any 12-month period ending on or before the termination date and calculated from that date are aggregated and treated as one benefit increase.
(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, a benefit increase described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be guaranteed only if PBGC determines that the plan was terminated for a reasonable business purpose and not for the purpose of obtaining the payment of benefits by PBGC.
(f)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination date” each place that “termination date” appears in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Example: A plan amendment that was adopted and effective in February 2007 increased a participant's benefit by $300 per month (as computed under § 4022.24). The contributing sponsor of the plan filed a bankruptcy petition in March 2009 and the plan has a termination date in April 2010. PBGC's guarantee of the participant's benefit increase is limited to $120 ($300 × 40%), because the increase was made more than 2 years but less than 3 years before the bankruptcy filing date.
[61 FR 34028, July 1, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 16956, Apr. 8, 2002; 76 FR 34603, June 14, 2011; 83 FR 49804, Oct. 3, 2018]
§ 4022.26
Benefit guarantee for participants who are majority owners.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies to the guarantee of all benefits described in subpart A of this part (subject to the limitations in § 4022.21) with respect to participants who are majority owners at the termination date or who were majority owners at any time within
the five-year period preceding that date.
(b)
Formula.
Benefits provided by a plan are guaranteed to the extent provided in the following formula: The amount of the participant's benefit that PBGC would otherwise guarantee under section 4022 of ERISA and this part if the participant were not a majority owner, multiplied by a fraction not to exceed one, the numerator of which is the number of full years from the later of the effective date or the adoption date of the plan to the termination date, and the denominator of which is 10.
(c)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination date” in paragraph (b) of this section.
[83 FR 49804, Oct. 3, 2018]
§ 4022.27
Phase-in of guarantee of unpredictable contingent event benefits.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies to a benefit increase, as defined in § 4022.2, that is an unpredictable contingent event benefit (UCEB) and that is payable with respect to an unpredictable contingent event (UCE) that occurs after July 26, 2005.
(1) Examples of benefit increases within the scope of this section include unreduced early retirement benefits or other early retirement subsidies, or other benefits to the extent that such benefits would not be payable but for the occurrence of one or more UCEs.
(2) Examples of UCEs within the scope of this section include full and partial closings of plants or other facilities, and permanent workforce reductions, such as permanent layoffs. Permanent layoffs include layoffs during which an idled employee continues to earn credited service (creep-type layoff) for a period of time at the end of which the layoff is deemed to be permanent. Permanent layoffs also include layoffs that become permanent upon the occurrence of an additional event such as a declaration by the employer that the participant's return to work is unlikely or a failure by the employer to offer the employee suitable work in a specified area.
(3) The examples in this section are not an exclusive list of UCEs or UCEBs and are not intended to narrow the statutory definitions, as further delineated in Treasury Regulations.
(b)
Facts and circumstances.
If PBGC determines that a benefit is a shutdown benefit or other type of UCEB, the benefit will be treated as a UCEB for purposes of this subpart. PBGC will make such determinations based on the facts and circumstances, consistent with these regulations; how a benefit is characterized by the employer or other parties may be relevant but is not determinative.
(c)
Date phase-in begins.
(1) The date the phase-in of PBGC's guarantee of a UCEB begins is determined in accordance with subpart B of this part. For purposes of this subpart, a UCEB is deemed to be in effect as of the latest of—
(i) The adoption date of the plan provision that provides for the UCEB,
(ii) The effective date of the UCEB, or
(iii) The date the UCE occurs.
(2) The date the phase-in of PBGC's guarantee of a UCEB begins is not affected by any delay that may occur in placing participants in pay status due to removal of a restriction under section 436(b) of the Code. See the example in paragraph (e)(8) of this section.
(d)
Date UCE occurs.
For purposes of this section, PBGC will determine the date the UCE occurs based on plan provisions and other facts and circumstances, including the nature and level of activity at a facility that is closing and the permanence of the event. PBGC will also consider, to the extent relevant, statements or determinations by the employer, the plan administrator, a union, an arbitrator under a collective bargaining agreement, or a court, but will not treat such statements or determinations as controlling.
(1) The date a UCE occurs is determined on a participant-by-participant basis, or on a different basis, such as a facility-wide or company-wide basis, depending upon plan provisions and the facts and circumstances. For example, a benefit triggered by a permanent layoff of a participant would be determined with respect to each participant,
and thus layoffs that occur on different dates would generally be distinct UCEs. In contrast, a benefit payable only upon a complete plant shutdown would apply facility-wide, and generally the shutdown date would be the date of the UCE for all participants who work at that plant. Similarly, a benefit payable only upon the complete shutdown of the employer's entire operations would apply plan-wide, and thus the shutdown date of company operations generally would be the date of the UCE for all participants.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, if a benefit is contingent upon more than one UCE, PBGC will apply the rule under Treas. Reg. § 1.436-1(b)(3)(ii) (26 CFR 1.436-1(b)(3)(ii)) (i.e., the date the UCE occurs is the date of the latest UCE).
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the operation of the rules in this section. Except as provided in Example 8, no benefit limitation under Code section 436 applies in any of these examples. Unless otherwise stated, the termination is not a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.

# Example 1.
Date of UCE.
(i)
Facts:
On January 1, 2006, a Company adopts a plan that provides an unreduced early retirement benefit for participants with specified age and service whose continuous service is broken by a permanent plant closing or permanent layoff that occurs on or after January 1, 2007. On January 1, 2013, the Company informally and without announcement decides to close Facility A within a two-year period. On January 1, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors passes a resolution directing the Company's officers to close Facility A on or before September 1, 2014. On June 1, 2014, the Company issues a notice pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, 29 U.S.C. 2101,
et seq.,
that Facility A will close, and all employees will be permanently laid off, on or about August 1, 2014. The Company and the Union representing the employees enter into collective bargaining concerning the closing of Facility A and on July 1, 2014, they jointly agree and announce that Facility A will close and employees who work there will be permanently laid off as of November 1, 2014. However, due to unanticipated business conditions, Facility A continues to operate until December 31, 2014, when operations cease and all employees are permanently laid off. The plan terminates as of December 1, 2015.
(ii)
Conclusion:
PBGC would determine that the UCE is the facility closing and permanent layoff that occurred on December 31, 2014. Because the date that the UCE occurred (December 31, 2014) is later than both the date the plan provision that established the UCEB was adopted (January 1, 2006) and the date the UCEB became effective (January 1, 2007), December 31, 2014, would be the date the phase-in period under ERISA section 4022 begins. In light of the plan termination date of December 1, 2015, the guarantee of the UCEBs of participants laid off on December 31, 2014, would be 0 percent phased in.

# Example 2.
Sequential layoffs.
(i)
Facts:
The same facts as Example 1, with these exceptions: Not all employees are laid off on December 31, 2014. The Company and Union agree to and subsequently implement a shutdown in which employees are permanently laid off in stages—one third of the employees are laid off on October 31, 2014, another third are laid off on November 30, 2014, and the remaining one-third are laid off on December 31, 2014.
(ii)
Conclusion:
Because the plan provides that a UCEB is payable in the event of either a permanent layoff or a plant shutdown, PBGC would determine that phase-in begins on the date of the UCE applicable to each of the three groups of employees. Because the first two groups of employees were permanently laid off before the plant closed, October 31, 2014, and November 30, 2014, are the dates that the phase-in period under ERISA section 4022 begins for those groups. Because the third group was permanently laid off on December 31, 2014, the same date the plant closed, the phase-in period would begin on that date for that group. Based on the plan termination date of December 1, 2015, participants laid off on October 31, 2014, and November 30, 2014, would have 20 percent of the UCEBs (or $20 per month, if greater) guaranteed under the phase-in rule. The guarantee of the UCEBs of participants laid off on December 31, 2014, would be 0 percent phased in.

# Example 3.
Skeleton shutdown crews.
(i)
Facts:
The same facts as Example 1, with these exceptions: The plan provides for an unreduced early retirement benefit for age/service-qualified participants only in the event of a break in continuous service due to a permanent and complete plant closing. A minimal skeleton crew remains to perform primarily security and basic maintenance functions until March 31, 2015, when skeleton crew members are permanently laid off and the facility is sold to an unrelated investment group that does not assume the plan or resume business operations at the facility. The plan has no specific provision or past practice governing benefits of skeleton shutdown crews. The plan terminates as of January 1, 2015.
(ii)
Conclusion:
Because the continued employment of the skeleton crew does not effectively continue operations of the facility,
PBGC would determine that there is a permanent and complete plant closing (for purposes of the plan's plant closing provision) as of December 31, 2014, which is the date the phase-in period under ERISA section 4022 begins with respect to employees who incurred a break in continuous service at that time. The UCEB of those participants would be a nonforfeitable benefit as of the plan termination date, but PBGC's guarantee of the UCEB would be 0 percent phased in. In the case of the skeleton crew members, such participants would not be eligible for the UCEB because they did not incur a break in continuous service until after the plan termination date. (If the plan had a provision that there is no shutdown until all employees, including any skeleton crew are terminated, or if the plan were reasonably interpreted to so provide in light of past practice, PBGC would determine that the date that the UCE occurred was after the plan termination date. Thus the UCEB would not be a nonforfeitable benefit as of the plan termination date and therefore would not be guaranteeable.)

# Example 4.
Creep-type layoff benefit/bankruptcy of contributing sponsor.
(i)
Facts:
A plan provides that participants who are at least age 55 and whose age plus years of continuous service equal at least 80 are entitled to an unreduced early retirement benefit if their continuous service is broken due to a permanent layoff. The plan further provides that a participant's continuous service is broken due to a permanent layoff when the participant is terminated due to the permanent shutdown of a facility, or the participant has been on layoff status for two years. These provisions were adopted and effective in 1990. Participant A is 56 years old and has 25 years of continuous service when he is laid off in a reduction-in-force on May 15, 2014. He is not recalled to employment, and on May 15, 2016, under the terms of the plan, his continuous service is broken due to the layoff. He goes into pay status on June 1, 2016, with an unreduced early retirement benefit. The contributing sponsor of Participant A's plan files a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on September 1, 2017, and the plan terminates during the bankruptcy proceedings with a termination date of October 1, 2018. Under section 4022(g) of ERISA, because the plan terminated while the contributing sponsor was in bankruptcy, the five-year phase-in period ended on the bankruptcy filing date.
(ii)
Conclusion:
PBGC would determine that the guarantee of the UCEB is phased in beginning on May 15, 2016, the date of the later of the two UCEs necessary to make this benefit payable (i.e., the first UCE is the initial layoff and the second UCE is the expiration of the two-year period without rehire). Since that date is more than one year (but less than two years) before the September 1, 2017, bankruptcy filing date, 20 percent of Participant A's UCEB (or $20 per month, if greater) would be guaranteed under the phase-in rule.

# Example 5.
Creep-type layoff benefit with provision for declaration that return to work unlikely.
(i)
Facts:
A plan provides that participants who are at least age 60 and have at least 20 years of continuous service are entitled to an unreduced early retirement benefit if their continuous service is broken by a permanent layoff. The plan further provides that a participant's continuous service is broken by a permanent layoff if the participant is laid off and the employer declares that the participant's return to work is unlikely. Participants may earn up to 2 years of credited service while on layoff. The plan was adopted and effective in 1990. On March 1, 2014, Participant B, who is age 60 and has 20 years of service, is laid off. On June 15, 2014, the employer declares that Participant B's return to work is unlikely. Participant B retires and goes into pay status as of July 1, 2014. The employer files for bankruptcy on September 1, 2016, and the plan terminates during the bankruptcy.
(ii)
Conclusion:
PBGC would determine that the phase-in period of the guarantee of the UCEB would begin on June 15, 2014—the later of the two UCEs necessary to make the benefit payable (i.e., the first UCE is the initial layoff and the second UCE is the employer's declaration that it is unlikely that Participant B will return to work). The phase-in period would end on September 1, 2016, the date of the bankruptcy filing. Thus 40 percent of Participant B's UCEB (or $40 per month, if greater) would be guaranteed under the phase-in rule.

# Example 6.
Shutdown benefit with special post-employment eligibility provision.
(i)
Facts:
A plan provides that, in the event of a permanent shutdown of a plant, a participant age 60 or older who terminates employment due to the shutdown and who has at least 20 years of service is entitled to an unreduced early retirement benefit. The plan also provides that a participant with at least 20 years of service who terminates employment due to a plant shutdown at a time when the participant is under age 60 also will be entitled to an unreduced early retirement benefit, provided the participant's commencement of benefits is on or after attainment of age 60 and the time required to attain age 60 does not exceed the participant's years of service with the plan sponsor. The plan imposes no other conditions on receipt of the benefit. Plan provisions were adopted and effective in 1990. On January 1, 2014, Participant C's plant is permanently shut down. At the time of the shutdown, Participant C had 20 years of service and was age 58. On June 1, 2015, Participant C reaches age 60 and retires. The plan terminates as of September 1, 2015.
(ii)
Conclusion:
PBGC would determine that the guarantee of the shutdown benefit is
phased in from January 1, 2014, which is the date of the only UCE (the permanent shutdown of the plant) necessary to make the benefit payable. Thus 20 percent of Participant C's UCEB (or $20 per month, if greater) would be guaranteed under the phase-in rule.

# Example 7.
Phase-in of retroactive UCEB.
(i)
Facts:
As the result of a settlement in a class-action lawsuit, a plan provision is adopted on September 1, 2014, to provide that age/service-qualified participants are entitled to an unreduced early retirement benefit if permanently laid off due to a plant shutdown occurring on or after January 1, 2014. Benefits under the provision are payable prospectively only, beginning March 1, 2015. Participant A, who was age/service-qualified, was permanently laid off due to a plant shutdown occurring on January 1, 2014, and therefore he is scheduled to be placed in pay status as of March 1, 2015. The unreduced early retirement benefit is paid to Participant A beginning on March 1, 2015. The plan terminates as of February 1, 2017.
(ii)
Conclusion:
PBGC would determine that the guarantee of the UCEB is phased in beginning on March 1, 2015. This is the date the benefit was effective (since it was the first date on which the new benefit was payable), and it is later than the adoption date of the plan provision (September 1, 2014) and the date of the UCE (January 1, 2014). Thus 20 percent of Participant A's UCEB (or $20 per month, if greater) would be guaranteed under the phase-in rule.

# Example 8.
Removal of IRC section 436 restriction.
(i)(A)
Facts:
A plan provision was adopted on September 1, 1989, to provide that age/service-qualified participants are entitled to an unreduced early retirement benefit if permanently laid off due to a plant shutdown occurring after January 1, 1990. Participant A, who was age/service-qualified, was permanently laid off due to a plant shutdown occurring on April 15, 2014. The plan is a calendar year plan.
(B) Under the rules of Code section 436 (ERISA section 206(g)) and Treasury regulations thereunder, a plan cannot provide a UCEB payable with respect to an unpredictable contingent event, if the event occurs during a plan year in which the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage is less than 60%. On March 17, 2014, the plan's enrolled actuary issued a certification stating that the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for 2014 is 58%. Therefore, the plan restricts payment of the unreduced early retirement benefit payable with respect to the shutdown on April 15, 2014.
(C) On August 15, 2014, the plan sponsor makes an additional contribution to the plan that is designated as a contribution under Code section 436(b)(2) to eliminate the restriction on payment of the shutdown benefits. On September 15, 2014, the plan's enrolled actuary issues a certification stating that, due to the additional section 436(b)(2) contribution, the plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for 2014 is 60%. On October 1, 2014, Participant A is placed in pay status for the unreduced early retirement benefit and, as required under Code section 436 and Treasury regulations thereunder, is in addition paid retroactively the unreduced benefit for the period May 1, 2014 (the date the unreduced early retirements would have become payable) through September 1, 2014. The plan terminates as of September 1, 2016.
(ii)
Conclusion:
PBGC would determine that the guarantee of the UCEB is phased in beginning on April 15, 2014, the date the UCE occurred. Because April 15, 2014, is later than both the date the UCEB was adopted (September 1, 1989) and the date the UCEB became effective (January 1, 1990), it would be the date the phase-in period under ERISA section 4022 begins. Commencement of the phase-in period is not affected by the delay in providing the unreduced early retirement benefit to Participant A due to the operation of the rules of Code section 436 and the Treasury regulations thereunder. Thus 40 percent of Participant A's UCEB (or $40 per month, if greater) would be guaranteed under the phase-in rule.

§ 4022.28
Effect of tax disqualification.
(a)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, benefits accrued under a plan after the date on which the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate issues a notice that any trust which is part of the plan no longer meets the requirements of section 401(a) of the Code or that the plan no longer meets the requirements of section 404(a) of the Code or after the date of adoption of a plan amendment that causes the issuance of such a notice shall not be guaranteed under this part.
(b)
Exceptions.
The restriction on the guarantee of benefits set forth in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply if:
(1) The Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate issues a notice stating that the original notice referred to in paragraph (a) of this section was erroneous;
(2) The Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate finds that, subsequent to the issuance of the notice referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, appropriate action has been taken with respect to the trust or plan to cause it to
meet the requirements of sections 401(a) or 404(a)(2) of the Code, respectively, and issues a subsequent notice stating that the trust or plan meets such requirements; or
(3) The plan amendment is revoked retroactively to its original effective date.

# Subpart C—Section 4022(c) Benefits
§ 4022.51
Determination of section 4022(c) benefits in a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
(a)
Amount of unfunded nonguaranteed benefits.
For purposes of this section, and subject to paragraph (b) of this section, a plan's amount of unfunded nonguaranteed benefits means the plan's outstanding amount of benefit liabilities, as defined in section 4001(a)(19) of ERISA, determined as of the plan's termination date. A plan's amount of unfunded nonguaranteed benefits is multiplied by the applicable recovery ratio to determine the aggregate amount to be allocated with respect to participants of the plan under section 4022(c)(1) of ERISA.
(b)
Benefits included in unfunded nonguaranteed benefits.
For purposes of computing benefits under section 4022(c) of ERISA in a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, unfunded nonguaranteed benefits are benefits under a plan as of the plan's termination date that are neither guaranteed by PBGC (taking into account section 4022(g) of ERISA) nor funded by the plan's assets (taking into account section 4044(e) of ERISA).
(c)
Determination of recovery ratio.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, the recovery ratio under section 4022(c)(3) of ERISA is determined as follows. The numerator is based on PBGC's recoveries under section 4062, 4063, or 4064, valued as of the plan's (or plans') termination date (or dates). The denominator of the recovery ratio is based on the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities, as defined in section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA, as of the plan's (or plans') termination date (or dates).

# Subpart D—Benefit Reductions in Terminating Plans
§ 4022.61
Limitations on benefit payments by plan administrator.
(a)
General.
When § 4041.42 of this chapter requires a plan administrator to reduce benefits, the plan administrator shall limit benefit payments in accordance with this section.
(b)
Accrued benefit at normal retirement.
Except to the extent permitted by paragraph (d) of this section, a plan administrator may not pay that portion of a monthly benefit payable with respect to any participant that exceeds the participant's accrued benefit payable at normal retirement age under the plan. For the purpose of applying this limitation, post-retirement benefit increases, such as cost-of-living adjustments, are not considered to increase a participant's benefit beyond his or her accrued benefit payable at normal retirement age.
(c)
Maximum guaranteeable benefit.
Except to the extent permitted by paragraph (d) of this section, a plan administrator may not pay that portion of a monthly benefit payable with respect to any participant, as limited by paragraph (b) of this section, that exceeds the maximum guaranteeable benefit under section 4022(b)(3)(B) of ERISA and § 4022.22(a)(2) of this part, adjusted for age and benefit form, for the year of the proposed termination date. In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, the maximum guaranteeable benefit is determined as of the bankruptcy filing date, in accordance with §§ 4022.22(b) and 4022.23(g).
(d)
Estimated benefit payments.
A plan administrator shall pay the monthly benefit payable with respect to each participant as determined under § 4022.62 or § 4022.63, whichever produces the higher benefit.
(e)
PBGC authority to modify procedures.
In order to avoid abuse of the plan termination insurance system, inequitable treatment of participants and beneficiaries, or the imposition of unreasonable burdens on terminating plans, the PBGC may authorize or direct the use of alternative procedures for determining benefit reductions.
(f)
Examples.
This section is illustrated by the following examples. (For
examples addressing issues specific to a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, see §§ 4022.21(e), 4022.22(b), and 4022.23(g).)

# Example 1. Facts.
On October 10, 1992, a plan administrator files with the PBGC a notice of intent to terminate in a distress termination that includes December 31, 1992, as the proposed termination date. A participant who is in pay status on December 31, 1992, has been receiving his accrued benefit of $2,500 per month under the plan. The benefit is in the form of a joint and survivor annuity (contingent basis) that will pay 50 percent of the participant's benefit amount (
i.e.
, $1,250 per month) to his surviving spouse following the death of the participant. On December 31, 1992, the participant is age 66, and his wife is age 56.
Benefit reductions.
Paragraph (b) of this section requires the plan administrator to cease paying benefits in excess of the accrued benefit payable at normal retirement age. Because the participant is receiving only his accrued benefit, no reduction is required under paragraph (b).
Paragraph (c) of this section requires the plan administrator to cease paying benefits in excess of the maximum guaranteeable benefit, adjusted for age and benefit form in accordance with the provisions of subpart B. The maximum guaranteeable benefit for plans terminating in 1992, the year of the proposed termination date, is $2,352.27 per month, payable in the form of a single life annuity at age 65. Because the participant is older than age 65, no adjustment is required under § 4022.23(c) based on the annuitant's age factor. The benefit form is a joint and survivor annuity (contingent basis), as defined in § 4022.23(d)(2). The required benefit reduction for this benefit form under § 4022.23(d) is 10 percent. The corresponding adjustment factor is 0.90 (1.00-0.10). The benefit reduction factor to adjust for the age difference between the participant and the beneficiary is computed under § 4022.23(e). In computing the difference in ages, years over 65 years of age are not taken into account. Therefore, the age difference is 9 years (65-56). The required percentage reduction when the beneficiary is 9 years younger than the participant is 9 percent. The corresponding adjustment factor is 0.91 (1.00-0.09).
The maximum guaranteeable benefit adjusted for age and benefit form is $1,926.51 ($2,352.27 × 0.90 × 0.91) per month. Therefore, the plan administrator must reduce the participant's benefit payment from $2,500 to $1,926.51. If the participant dies after December 31, 1992, the plan administrator will pay his spouse $963.26 (0.50 × $1,926.51) per month.

# Example 2. Facts.
The benefit of a participant who retired under a plan at age 60 is a reduced single life annuity of $400 per month plus a temporary supplement of $400 per month payable until age 62 (
i.e.,
a step-down benefit). The participant's accrued benefit under the plan is $450 per month, payable from the plan's normal retirement age. On the proposed termination date, June 30, 1992, the participant is 61 years old.
The maximum guaranteeable benefit adjusted for age under § 4022.23(c) of this chapter is $1,693.63 ($2,352.27 × 0.72) per month. Since the benefit is payable as a single life annuity, no adjustment is required under § 4022.23(d) for benefit form.
Benefit reductions.
The plan benefit of $800 per month payable until age 62 exceeds the participant's accrued benefit at normal requirement age of $450 per month. Paragraph (b) of this section requires that, except to the extent permitted by paragraph (d), the plan benefit must be reduced to $450 per month. Since the levelized benefit of $404.10 ((0.082 × 50) + $400) per month, determined under § 4022.23(f), is less than the adjusted maximum guaranteeable benefit of $1,693.63 per month, no further reduction in the $450 per month benefit payment is required under paragraph (c) of this section. The plan administrator next would determine the amount of the participant's estimated benefit under paragraph (d).

# Example 3. Facts.
A retired participant is receiving a reduced early retirement benefit of $1,100 per month plus a temporary supplement of $700 per month payable until age 62. The benefit is in the form of a single life annuity. On the proposed termination date, November 30, 1992, the participant is 56 years old.
The participant's accrued benefit at normal retirement age under the plan is $1,200 per month. The maximum guaranteeable benefit adjusted for age is $1,152.61 ($2,352.27 × 0.49) per month. A form adjustment is not required.
Benefit reductions.
The plan benefit of $1,800 per month payable from age 56 to age 62 exceeds the participant's accrued benefit at normal retirement age of $1,200 per month. Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this section, the plan administrator must reduce the temporary supplement to $100 per month.
For the purpose of determining whether the reduced benefit,
i.e.,
a level-life annuity of $1,100 per month and a temporary annuity supplement of $100 per month to age 62, exceeds the maximum guaranteeable benefit adjusted for age, the temporary annuity supplement of $100 per month is converted to a level-life annuity equivalent in accordance with § 4022.23(f) of this chapter. The level-life annuity equivalent is $38.70 ($100 × 0.387). This, added to the life annuity of $1,100 per month, equals $1,138.70. Since the maximum guaranteeable benefit of $1,152.61 per month exceeds $1,138.70 per month, no further reduction is required under paragraph (c) of this section.
The plan administrator next would determine the participant's estimated benefit
under paragraph (d). Assume that the estimated benefit under paragraph (d) is $780 per month until age 62 and $715 per month thereafter. The plan administrator would pay the participant $780 per month, reduced to $715 per month at age 62, subject to the final benefit determination made under title IV.

# Example 4. Facts.
A retired participant is receiving a reduced early retirement benefit of $2,650 per month plus a temporary supplement of $800 per month payable until age 62. The benefit is in the form of a joint and survivor annuity (contingent basis) that will pay 50 percent of the participant's benefit amount to his surviving spouse following the death of the participant. On the proposed termination date, December 20, 1992, the participant and his spouse are each 56 years old.
The participant's accrued benefit at normal retirement age under the plan is $3,000 per month. The maximum guaranteeable benefit adjusted for age and the joint and survivor annuity (contingent basis) annuity form is $1,037.35 per month. An adjustment for age difference is not required because the participant and his spouse are the same age.
Benefit reductions.
The plan benefit of $3,450 per month payable from age 56 to age 62 exceeds the participant's accrued benefit at normal retirement age, which is $3,000 per month. Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this section, the plan administrator must reduce the participant's benefit so that it does not exceed $3,000 per month.
The level-life equivalent of the participant's reduced benefit, determined using the § 4022.23(f) adjustment factor, is $2,785.45 (($350 × 0.387) + $2,650) per month. Since this benefit exceeds the participant's maximum guaranteeable benefit of $1,037.35 per month, the plan administrator must reduce the participant's benefit payment so that it does not exceed the maximum guaranteeable benefit.
The ratio of (i) the participant's maximum guaranteeable benefit to (ii) the level-life equivalent of the participant's reduced benefit (computed under the “accrued for normal retirement age” limitation) is used in converting the level-life maximum guaranteeable benefit to the step-down benefit form. The level-life equivalent of the reduced benefit computed under the “accrued for normal retirement age” limitation is 37.24 percent ($1,037.35/$2,785.45). Thus, the plan administrator must reduce the participant's level-life benefit of $2,650 per month to $986.86 ($2,650 × 0.3724) and must further reduce the reduced temporary benefit of $350 per month to $130.34 ($350 × 0.3724). Under paragraph (c) of this section, therefore, the participant's maximum guaranteeable benefit is $1,117.20 ($986.86 + $130.34) per month to age 62 and $986.86 per month thereafter, subject to any adjustment under paragraph (d) of this section.
Assume that the estimated benefit under paragraph (d) is $1,005.48 per month to age 62 and $888.17 per month thereafter. The plan administrator would reduce the participant's benefit from $3,450 per month to $1,005.48 per month and pay this amount until age 62, at which time the benefit payment would be reduced to $888.17 per month, subject to the final benefit determination made under title IV.
[61 FR 34028, July 1, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 60428, Nov. 7, 1997; 76 FR 34604, June 14, 2011]
§ 4022.62
Estimated guaranteed benefit.
(a)
General.
The estimated guaranteed benefit payable with respect to each participant who is not a majority owner is computed under paragraph (c) of this section. The estimated guaranteed benefit payable with respect to each participant who is a majority owner is computed under paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Rules for determining benefits.
For the purposes of determining entitlement to a benefit and the amount of the estimated benefit under this section, the following rules apply:
(1)
Non-PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a non-PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination:
(i) For benefits payable with respect to a participant who is in pay status on or before the proposed termination date, the plan administrator shall use the participant's age and benefit payable under the plan as of the proposed termination date.
(ii) For benefits payable with respect to a participant who enters pay status after the proposed termination date, the plan administrator shall use the participant's age as of the benefit commencement date and his service and compensation as of the proposed termination date.
(2)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination:
(i) For benefits payable with respect to a participant who is in pay status on or before the bankruptcy filing date, the plan administrator shall use the participant's age and benefit payable under the plan as of the bankruptcy filing date.
(ii) For benefits payable with respect to a participant who enters pay status after the bankruptcy filing date, the
plan administrator shall use the participant's age as of the benefit commencement date and his service and compensation as of the bankruptcy filing date.
(3)
Participants with new benefits or benefit improvements.
For the purpose of determining the estimated guaranteed benefit under paragraph (c) of this section, only new benefits and benefit improvements that affect the benefit of the participant or beneficiary for whom the determination is made are taken into account.
(4)
Limitations on estimated guaranteed benefits.
For the purpose of determining the estimated guaranteed benefit under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the benefit determined under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is subject to the limitations set forth in § 4022.61 (b) and (c).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph (b) overrides the provisions of subparts A and B of part 4022 with respect to the requirements necessary for a benefit to be guaranteed by PBGC.
(c)
Estimated guaranteed benefit payable with respect to a participant who is not a majority owner.
For benefits payable with respect to a participant who is not a majority owner, the estimated guaranteed benefit is determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if no portion of the benefit is subject to the phase-in of plan termination insurance guarantees set forth in section 4022(b)(1) of ERISA. In any other case, the estimated guaranteed benefit is determined under paragraph (c)(2). “Benefit subject to phase-in” means a benefit that is subject to the phase-in of plan termination insurance guarantees set forth in section 4022(b)(1) of ERISA, determined without regard to section 4022(b)(7) of ERISA.
(1)
Participants with no benefits subject to phase-in.
In the case of a participant or beneficiary with no benefit improvement (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)) or new benefit (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i)) in the five years preceding the proposed termination date, the estimated guaranteed benefit is the benefit to which he or she is entitled under the rules in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Participants with benefits subject to phase-in.
In the case of a participant or beneficiary with a benefit improvement or new benefit in the five years preceding the proposed termination date, the estimated guaranteed benefit is the benefit to which he or she is entitled under the rules in paragraph (b) of this section, multiplied by the multiplier determined according to paragraphs (i), (ii), and (iii), but not less than the benefit to which he or she would have been entitled if the benefit improvement or new benefit had not been adopted.
(i) From column (a) of Table I, select the line that applies according to the number of full years before the proposed termination date since the plan was last amended to provide for a new benefit (or the number of full years since the plan was established, if it has never been amended to provide for a new benefit). “New benefit” means a change in the terms of the plan that results in (a) a participant's or a beneficiary's eligibility for a benefit that was not previously available or to which he or she was not entitled (excluding a benefit that is actuarially equivalent to the normal retirement benefit to which the participant was previously entitled) or (b) an increase of more than twenty percent in the benefit to which a participant is entitled upon entering pay status before his or her normal retirement age under the plan. “New benefits” result from liberalized participation or vesting requirements, reductions in the age or service requirements for receiving unreduced benefits, additions of actuarially subsidized benefits, and increases in actuarial subsidies. “New benefits” also result from increases that become payable by reason of the occurrence of an unpredictable contingent event (provided the event occurred after July 26, 2005), to the extent the increase would not be payable but for the occurrence of the event; in the case of such new benefits, the date of the occurrence of the unpredictable contingent event is treated as the amendment date for purposes of Table I. The establishment of a plan creates a new benefit as of the effective date of the plan. A change in the amount of a benefit is not deemed to be a “new benefit” if it
results solely from a benefit improvement. “New benefit” and “benefit improvement” are mutually exclusive terms.
(ii) If there was no benefit improvement under the plan during the one-year period ending on the proposed termination date, use the multiplier set forth in column (b) of Table I on the line selected from column (a). “Benefit improvement” means a change in the terms of the plan that results in (a) an increase in the benefit to which a participant is entitled at his or her normal retirement age under the plan or (b) an increase in the benefit to which a participant or beneficiary in pay status is entitled.
(iii) If there was any benefit improvement during the one-year period ending on the proposed termination date, use the multiplier set forth in column (c) of Table I on the line selected from column (a).

Note:
The foregoing method of estimating guaranteed benefits is based upon the PBGC's experience with a wide range of plans and may not provide accurate estimates in certain circumstances. In accordance with § 4022.61(e), a plan administrator may use a different method of estimation if he or she demonstrates to the PBGC that his proposed method will be more equitable to participants and beneficiaries. The PBGC may require the use of a different method in certain cases.
(d)
Estimated guaranteed benefit payable with respect to a majority owner.
For benefits payable with respect to each participant who is a majority owner, the estimated guaranteed benefit is the benefit to which he or she would be entitled under paragraph (c) of this section but for his or her status as a majority owner, multiplied by a fraction, not to exceed one, the numerator of which is the number of full years from the later of the effective date or the adoption date of the plan to the proposed termination date and the denominator of which is 10.
(e)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “proposed termination date” each place that “proposed termination date” appears in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
(f)
Examples.
This section is illustrated by the following examples. (For an example addressing issues specific to a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, see § 4022.25(f).)
(1)
Example 1
—(i)
Facts.
A participant who is not a majority owner retired on December 31, 2011, at age 60 and began receiving a benefit of $600 per month. On January 1, 2009, the plan had been amended to allow participants to retire with unreduced benefits at age 60. Previously, a participant who retired before age 65 was subject to a reduction of
1/15
for each year by which his or her actual retirement age preceded age 65. On January 1, 2012, the plan's benefit formula was amended to increase benefits for participants who retired before January 1, 2012. As a result, the participant's benefit was increased to $750 per month. There have been no other pertinent amendments. The proposed termination date is December 15, 2012.
(ii)
Estimated guaranteed benefit.
(A) No reduction is required under § 4022.61(b) or (c) because the participant's benefit does not exceed either the participant's accrued benefit at normal retirement age or the maximum guaranteeable benefit. (Post-retirement benefit increases are not considered as increasing accrued benefits payable at normal retirement age.)
(B) The amendment as of January 1, 2009, resulted in a “new benefit” because the reduction in the age at which the participant could receive unreduced benefits increased the participant's benefit entitlement at actual retirement age by
5
/
15
, which is more than the 20-percent increase threshold under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. The amendment of January 1, 2012, which increased the participant's benefit to $750 per month, is a “benefit improvement” because it is an increase in the amount of benefit for persons in pay status. (No percentage test applies in determining whether an increase in a pay status benefit is a benefit improvement.)
(C) The multiplier for computing the amount of the estimated guaranteed benefit is taken from the third row of
Table I of this section (because the last new benefit had been in effect for three full years as of the proposed termination date) and column (c) (because there was a benefit improvement within the one-year period preceding the proposed termination date). This multiplier is 0.55. Therefore, the amount of the participant's estimated guaranteed benefit is $412.50 (0.55 × $750) per month.
(2)
Example 2
—(i)
Facts.
A participant who is not a majority owner terminated employment on December 31, 2010. On January 1, 2012, she reached age 65 and began receiving a benefit of $250 per month. She had completed three years of service at her termination of employment and was fully vested in her accrued benefit. The plan's vesting schedule had been amended on July 1, 2008. Under the schedule in effect before the amendment, a participant with five years of service was 100 percent vested. There have been no other pertinent amendments. The proposed termination date is December 31, 2012.
(ii)
Estimated guaranteed benefit.
No reduction is required under § 4022.61(b) or (c) because the participant's benefit does not exceed either her accrued benefit at normal retirement age or the maximum guaranteeable benefit. The plan's change of vesting schedule created a new benefit for the participant. Because the amendment was in effect for four full years before the proposed termination date, the second row of Table I of this section is used to determine the applicable multiplier for estimating the amount of the participant's guaranteed benefit. Because the participant did not receive any benefit improvement during the 12-month period ending on the proposed termination date, column (b) of the table is used. Therefore, the multiplier is 0.80, and the amount of the participant's estimated guaranteed benefit is $200 (0.80 × $250) per month.
(3)
Example 3
—(i)
Facts.
A participant who is a majority owner retired before the proposed termination date of April 30, 2012. The plan was in effect for seven full years as of the proposed termination date. On the proposed termination date he was entitled to receive a benefit of $2,000 per month. No reduction of this benefit is required under § 4022.61(b) or (c).
(ii)
Estimated guaranteed benefit.
Paragraph (d) of this section is used to compute the amount of the estimated guaranteed benefit of majority owners. Consequently, the amount of this participant's estimated guaranteed benefit is $1,400 ($2,000 ×
7/10
) per month.
(4)
Example 4
—(i)
Facts.
A participant who is a majority owner retired before the proposed termination date of April 30, 2012. The plan was in effect for 12 full years as of the proposed termination date. On the proposed termination date he was entitled to receive a benefit of $2,000 per month. No reduction of this benefit is required under § 4022.61(b) or (c).
(ii)
Estimated guaranteed benefit.
Paragraph (d) of this section is used to compute the amount of the estimated guaranteed benefit of majority owners. Since the plan was in effect for more than 10 years as of the proposed termination date, the amount of this participant's estimated guaranteed benefit is $2,000 per month.

§ 4022.63
Estimated asset-funded benefit.
(a)
General.
If the conditions specified in paragraph (b) exist, the plan administrator shall determine each participant's estimated asset-funded benefit. The estimated asset-funded benefit payable with respect to each participant who is not a majority owner is computed under paragraph (c) of this section. The estimated asset-funded benefit payable with respect to each participant who is a majority owner is computed under paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Conditions for use of this section.
The conditions set forth in this paragraph must be satisfied in order to make use of the procedures set forth in this section. If the specified conditions exist, estimated asset-funded benefits must be determined in accordance with these procedures (or in accordance with alternative procedures authorized by PBGC under § 4022.61(f)) for each participant and beneficiary whose benefit under the plan exceeds the limitations
contained in § 4022.61(b) or (c) or who is a majority owner or the beneficiary of a majority owner. If the specified conditions do not exist, title IV benefits may be estimated by the plan administrator in accordance with procedures authorized by PBGC, but no such estimate is required. The conditions are as follows:
(1) An actuarial valuation of the plan has been performed for a plan year beginning not more than eighteen months before the proposed termination date. If the interest rate used to value plan liabilities in this valuation exceeded the applicable valuation interest rates and factors under § 4044.54 of this chapter in effect on the proposed termination date, the value of benefits in pay status and the value of vested benefits not in pay status on the valuation date must be converted to PBGC's valuation rates and factors.
(2) The plan has been in effect for at least five full years before the proposed termination date, and the most recent actuarial valuation demonstrates that the value of plan assets, reduced by employee contributions remaining in the plan and interest credited thereon under the terms of the plan, exceeds the present value, adjusted as required under paragraph (b)(1), of all plan benefits in pay status on the valuation date.
(3)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “proposed termination date” in the first sentence of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(c)
In general
—(1)
Estimated asset-funded benefit payable with respect to a participant who is not a majority owner.
For benefits payable with respect to a participant who is not a majority owner, the estimated asset-funded benefit is the estimated priority category 3 benefit computed under this paragraph. Priority category 3 benefits are payable with respect to participants who were, or could have been, in pay status three full years prior to the proposed termination date. The estimated priority category 3 benefit is computed by multiplying the benefit payable with respect to the participant under § 4022.62 (b)(1) and (b)(2) by a fraction, not to exceed one—
(i) The numerator of which is the benefit that would be payable with respect to the participant at normal retirement age under the provisions of the plan in effect on the date five full years before the proposed termination date, based on the participant's age, service, and compensation as of the earlier of the participant's benefit commencement date or the proposed termination date, and
(ii) The denominator of which is the benefit that would be payable with respect to the participant at normal retirement age under the provisions of the plan in effect on the proposed termination date, based on the participant's age, service, and compensation as of the earlier of the participant's benefit commencement date or the proposed termination date.
(2)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “proposed termination date” each place that “proposed termination date” appears in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Estimated asset-funded benefit payable with respect to a majority owner.
For benefits payable with respect to a participant who is a majority owner, the estimated asset-funded benefit is the higher of the benefit computed under paragraph (c) of this section or the benefit computed under this paragraph.
(1) The plan administrator shall first calculate the estimated guaranteed benefit payable with respect to the majority owner as if he or she were not a majority owner, using the method set forth in § 4022.62(c).
(2) The benefit computed under paragraph (d)(1) shall be multiplied by the priority category 4 funding ratio. The category 4 funding ratio is the ratio of x to y, not to exceed one, where—
(i) In a plan with priority category 3 benefits, x equals plan assets minus employee contributions remaining in the plan on the valuation date, with interest credited thereon under the terms of the plan, and the present value of benefits in pay status, and y equals the present value of all vested benefits not in pay status minus such employee contributions and interest; or
(ii) In a plan with no priority category 3 benefits, x equals plan assets
minus employee contributions remaining in the plan on the valuation date, with interest credited thereon under the terms of the plan, and y equals the present value of all vested benefits minus such employee contributions and interest.
(e)
Examples.
This section is illustrated by the following examples:
(1)
Example 1
—(i)
Facts.
(A) A participant who is not a majority owner was eligible to retire 3.5 years before the proposed termination date. The participant retired two years before the proposed termination date with 20 years of service. Her final five years' average salary was $45,000, and she was entitled to an unreduced early retirement benefit of $1,500 per month payable as a single life annuity. This retirement benefit does not exceed the limitation in § 4022.61(b) or (c).
(B) On the participant's benefit commencement date, the plan provided for a normal retirement benefit of 2 percent of the final five years' salary times the number of years of service. Five years before the proposed termination date, the percentage was 1.5 percent. The amendments improving benefits were put into effect 3.5 years before the proposed termination date. There were no other amendments during the five-year period.
(C) The participant's estimated guaranteed benefit computed under § 4022.62(c) is $1,500 per month times 0.90 (the factor from column (b) of Table I in § 4022.62(c)(2)), or $1,350 per month. It is assumed that the plan meets the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and the plan administrator is therefore required to estimate the asset-funded benefit.
(ii)
Estimated asset-funded benefit.
(A) For a participant who is not a majority owner, the amount of the estimated asset-funded benefit is the estimated priority category 3 benefit computed under paragraph (c) of this section. This amount is computed by multiplying the participant's benefit under the plan as of the later of the proposed termination date or the benefit commencement date by the ratio of the normal retirement benefit under the provisions of the plan in effect five years before the proposed termination date and the normal retirement benefit under the plan provisions in effect on the proposed termination date.
(B) Thus, the numerator of the ratio is the benefit that would be payable to the participant under the normal retirement provisions of the plan five years before the proposed termination date, based on her age, service, and compensation on her benefit commencement date. The denominator of the ratio is the benefit that would be payable to the participant under the normal retirement provisions of the plan in effect on the proposed termination date, based on her age, service, and compensation as of the earlier of her benefit commencement date or the proposed termination date. Since the only different factor in the numerator and denominator is the salary percentage, the amount of the estimated asset-funded benefit is $1,125 (0.015/0.020 × $1,500) per month. This amount is less than the estimated guaranteed benefit of $1,350 per month. Therefore, in accordance with § 4022.61(d), the benefit payable to the participant is $1,350 per month.
(iii)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, the methodology would be the same, but “bankruptcy filing date” would be substituted for “proposed termination date” each place that “proposed termination date” appears in the example, and the numbers would change accordingly.
(2)
Example 2
—(i)
Facts.
(A) A participant who is a majority owner retired on the proposed termination date of October 31, 2012. The original plan had been in effect for seven full years as of the proposed termination date. Under the provisions of the plan in effect five years before the proposed termination date, the participant is entitled to a single life annuity of $500 per month. The plan was amended to increase benefits three full years before the proposed termination date. Under these plan amendments, the participant is entitled to a single life annuity of $1,000 per month.
(B) The participant's estimated guaranteed benefit computed under § 4022.62(d) is $455 per month ($1,000 × 0.65 ×
7/10
).
(C) It is assumed that all of the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section
have been met. Plan assets equal $2 million. The present value of all benefits in pay status is $1.5 million based on applicable PBGC interest rates. There are no employee contributions and the present value of all vested benefits that are not in pay status is $0.75 million based on applicable PBGC interest rates.
(ii)
Estimated asset-funded benefit.
(A) Paragraph (d) of this section provides that the amount of the estimated asset-funded benefit payable with respect to a participant who is a majority owner is the higher of the estimated priority category 3 benefit computed under paragraph (c) of this section or the estimated priority category 4 benefit computed under paragraph (d) of this section.
(B) Under paragraph (c) of this section, the participant's estimated priority category 3 benefit is $500 ($1,000 × $500/$1,000) per month.
(C) Under paragraph (d) of this section, the participant's estimated priority category 4 benefit is the estimated guaranteed benefit computed under § 4022.62(c) (
i.e.,
as if the participant were not a majority owner) multiplied by the priority category 4 funding ratio. Since the plan has priority category 3 benefits, the ratio is determined under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. The numerator of the ratio is plan assets minus the present value of benefits in pay status. The denominator of the ratio is the present value of all vested benefits that are not in pay status. The participant's estimated guaranteed benefit under § 4022.62(c) is $1,000 per month times 0.65 (the factor from column (b) of Table I in § 4022.62(c)(2)), or $650 per month. Multiplying $650 by the category 4 funding ratio of
2/3
(($2 million−$1.5 million)/$0.75 million) produces an estimated category 4 benefit of $433.33 per month.
(D) Because the estimated category 4 benefit so computed is less than the estimated category 3 benefit so computed, the estimated category 3 benefit is the estimated asset-funded benefit. Because the estimated category 3 benefit so computed is greater than the estimated guaranteed benefit of $455 per month, in accordance with § 4022.61(d), the benefit payable to the participant is the estimated priority category 3 benefit of $500 per month.

# Subpart E—PBGC Recoupment and Reimbursement of Benefit Overpayments and Underpayments
§ 4022.81
General rules.
(a)
Recoupment of benefit overpayments.
If at any time the PBGC determines that net benefits paid with respect to any participant in a PBGC-trusteed plan exceed the total amount to which the participant (and any beneficiary) is entitled up to that time under title IV of ERISA, and the participant (or beneficiary) is, as of the termination date, entitled to receive future benefit payments, the PBGC will recoup the net overpayment in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and § 4022.82. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the PBGC may, in its discretion, recover overpayments by methods other than recouping in accordance with the rules in this subpart. The PBGC will not normally do so unless net benefits paid after the termination date exceed those to which a participant (and any beneficiary) is entitled under the terms of the plan before any reductions under subpart D.
(b)
Reimbursement of benefit underpayments.
If at any time the PBGC determines that net benefits paid with respect to a participant in a PBGC-trusteed plan are less than the amount to which the participant (and any beneficiary) is entitled up to that time under title IV of ERISA, the PBGC will reimburse the participant or beneficiary for the net underpayment in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and § 4022.83.
(c)
Amount to be recouped or reimbursed.
In order to determine the amount to be recouped from, or reimbursed to, a participant (or beneficiary), the PBGC will calculate a monthly account balance for each month ending after the termination
date. The PBGC will start with a balance of zero as of the end of the calendar month ending immediately prior to the termination date and determine the account balance as of the end of each month thereafter as follows:
(1)
Debit for overpayments.
The PBGC will subtract from the account balance the amount of overpayments made in that month. Only overpayments made on or after the latest of the proposed termination date, the termination date, or, if no notice of intent to terminate was issued, the date on which proceedings to terminate the plan are instituted pursuant to section 4042 of ERISA will be included.
(2)
Credit for underpayments.
The PBGC will add to the account balance the amount of underpayments made in that month. Only underpayments made on or after the termination date will be included.
(3)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
The provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section regarding the overpayments and underpayments that will be included in the account balance apply regardless of whether the termination is a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
(4)
Credit for interest on net underpayments.
If at the end of a month there is a positive account balance (a net underpayment), the PBGC will add to the account balance interest thereon for that month using—
(i) For months after May 1998, the applicable federal mid-term rate (as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to section 1274(d)(1)(C)(ii) of the Code) for that month (or, where the rate for a month is not available at the time the PBGC calculates the amount to be recouped or reimbursed, the most recent month for which the rate is available) based on monthly compounding; and
(ii) For May 1998 and earlier months, the immediate annuity rate established for lump sum valuations as set forth in Table II of appendix B of part 4044 of this chapter.
(5)
No interest on net overpayments.
If at the end of a month, there is a negative account balance (a net overpayment), there will be no interest adjustment for that month.
(d)
Death of participant
—(1)
Benefit overpayments.
If the PBGC determines that, at the time of a participant's death, there was a net overpayment to the participant—
(i)
Future annuity payments.
If the participant was entitled to future annuity payments as of the plan's termination date, the PBGC will (except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section) recoup the overpayment from the person (if any) who is receiving survivor benefits under the annuity.
(ii)
No future annuity payments.
If the participant was not entitled to future annuity benefits as of the plan's termination date, the PBGC may seek repayment of the overpayment from the participant's estate.
(2)
Benefit underpayments.
If the PBGC determines that, at the time of a participant's death, there was a net underpayment to the participant—
(i)
Future annuity payments.
If the benefit is in the form of a joint-and-survivor or other annuity under which payments may continue after the participant's death, the PBGC will pay the underpayment to the person who is receiving survivor benefits; for this purpose, if the person receiving survivor benefits is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, the PBGC will treat the benefit as if payments do not continue after the participant's death (see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section).
(ii)
No future annuity payments.
If the benefit is not in the form of a joint-and-survivor or other annuity (e.g., a certain-and-continuous annuity) under which payments may continue after the participant's death or although the benefit is in such a form payments do not continue after the participant's death (
i.e.,
in the case of a joint-and-survivor annuity, the person designated to receive survivor benefits predeceased the participant or, in the case of another annuity under which payments may continue after the participant's death the participant died with no payments owed for future periods), the PBGC will pay the underpayment to the person determined
under the rules in §§ 4022.91 through 4022.95.
[63 FR 29354, May 29, 1998, as amended at 67 FR 16956, Apr. 8, 2002; 76 FR 34604, June 14, 2011]
§ 4022.82
Method of recoupment.
(a)
Future benefit reduction.
The PBGC will recoup net overpayments of benefits by reducing the amount of each future benefit payment to which the participant or any beneficiary is entitled by the fraction determined under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, except that benefit reduction will cease when the amount (without interest) of the net overpayment is recouped. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the PBGC may accept repayment ahead of the recoupment schedule.
(1)
Computation.
The PBGC will determine the fractional multiplier by dividing the amount of the net overpayment by the present value of the benefit payable with respect to the participant under title IV of ERISA.
(i)
Non-PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a non-PPA bankruptcy termination, the PBGC will determine the present value of the benefit to which a participant or beneficiary is entitled under title IV of ERISA as of the termination date, using the PBGC interest rates and factors in effect on that date.
(ii)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, PBGC will determine the amount of benefit payable with respect to the participant under title IV of ERISA taking into account the limitations in sections 4022(g) and 4044(e) (and corresponding provisions of these regulations), and will determine the present value of that amount as of the termination date, using PBGC interest rates and factors in effect on the termination date.
(iii)
Facts and circumstances.
The PBGC may, however, utilize a different date of determination if warranted by the facts and circumstances of a particular case.
(2)
Limitation on benefit reduction.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the PBGC will reduce benefits with respect to a participant or beneficiary by no more than the greater of—
(i) Ten percent per month; or
(ii) The amount of benefit per month in excess of the maximum guaranteeable benefit payable under section 4022(b)(3)(B) of ERISA, determined without adjustment for age and benefit form.
(3)
PBGC notice to participant or beneficiary.
Before effecting a benefit reduction pursuant to this paragraph, the PBGC will notify the participant or beneficiary in writing of the amount of the net overpayment and of the amount of the reduced benefit computed under this section.
(4)
Waiver of de minimis amounts.
The PBGC may, in its discretion, decide not to recoup net overpayments that it determines to be
de minimis.
(5)
Final installment.
The PBGC will cease recoupment one month early if the amount remaining to be recouped in the final month is less than the amount of the monthly reduction.
(b)
Full repayment through recoupment.
Recoupment under this section constitutes full repayment of the net overpayment.
[63 FR 29354, May 29, 1998, as amended at 76 FR 34604, June 14, 2011]
§ 4022.83
PBGC reimbursement of benefit underpayments.
When the PBGC determines that there has been a net benefit underpayment made with respect to a participant, it shall pay the participant or beneficiary the amount of the net underpayment, determined in accordance with § 4022.81(c), in a single payment.
[61 FR 34028, July 1, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 29355, May 29, 1998]

# Subpart F—Certain Payments Owed Upon Death

# Source:
67 FR 16957, Apr. 8, 2002, unless otherwise noted.
§ 4022.91
When do these rules apply?
(a)
Types of benefits.
Provided the conditions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are satisfied, these rules (§§ 4022.91 through 4022.95) apply to any benefits we may owe you (including benefits we owe you because your plan owed them) at the time of your death,
such as a payment of a lump-sum benefit that we calculated as of your plan's termination date but have not yet paid you or a back payment to reimburse you for monthly underpayments. We may owe you benefits at the time of your death if—
(1) You are a participant in a terminated plan;
(2) You are a beneficiary (including an alternate payee) of a participant; or
(3) You are a designee or other payee (e.g., a participant's next of kin) under these rules, as explained in § 4022.93.
(b)
Payments do not continue after death.
These rules apply only if payments do not continue after your death. (If payments continue after your death, we will make up any underpayment to you at the time of your death under the rule in § 4022.81(d)(2)(i) by paying it to the person who is entitled to receive those continuing payments.) Payments do not continue after your death if—
(1) Your benefit is not in the form of a joint-and-survivor or other annuity under which payments may continue after your death (e.g., a certain-and-continuous annuity);
(2) Your benefit is in the form of a joint-and-survivor annuity and the person designated to receive survivor benefits died before you; or
(3) Your benefit is in the form of another type of annuity under which payments may continue after your death (e.g., a certain-and-continuous annuity) but you die with no payments owed for future periods.
(c)
Time of death.
These rules apply only if you die—
(1) On or after the date we take over your plan (as trustee); or
(2) Before the date we take over your plan, to the extent that, by that date, the plan administrator has not paid all benefits owed to you at the time of your death.
(d)
Effect of plan or will.
These rules apply even if there is a contrary provision in a plan or will.
§ 4022.92
What definitions do I need to know for these rules?
You need to know three definitions from § 4001.2 of this chapter (PBGC, person, and plan) and the following definitions:
“We” means the PBGC.
“You” means the person to whom we may owe benefits at the time of death.
§ 4022.93
Who will get benefits PBGC may owe me at the time of my death?
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, we will pay any benefits we owe you at the time of your death to the person(s) surviving you in the following order—
(1)
Designee with the PBGC.
The person(s) you designated with us to get any benefits we may owe you at the time of your death. See § 4022.94 for information on designating with us.
(2)
Spouse.
Your spouse. We will consider a person to whom you are married to be your spouse even if you and that person are separated, unless a decree of divorce or annulment has been entered in a court.
(3)
Children.
Your children and descendants of your deceased children.
(i)
Adopted children.
In determining who is a child or descendant, an adopted child is treated the same way as a natural child.
(ii)
Child dies before parent.
If one of your children dies before you, any of your grandchildren through that deceased child will equally divide that deceased child's share; if one of your grandchildren through that deceased child dies before that deceased child, any of your great-grandchildren through that deceased grandchild will equally divide that deceased grandchild's share; and so on.
(4)
Parents.
Your parents. A parent includes an adoptive parent.
(5)
Estate.
Your estate, provided your estate is open.
(6)
Next of kin.
Your next of kin in accordance with applicable state law.
(b)
Pre-trusteeship deaths.
If you die before the date we take over your plan and, by that date, the plan administrator has not paid all benefits owed to you at the time of your death, we will pay any benefits we owe you at the time of your death to the person(s) designated by or under the plan to get those benefits (provided the designation clearly applies to those benefits). If there is no such designation, we will
pay those benefits to your spouse, children, parents, estate, or next of kin under the rules in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6) of this section.
(c)
Deaths shortly after trusteeship.
If you die within 180 days after the date we take over your plan and you have not designated anyone with the PBGC under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, we will pay any benefits we owe you at the time of your death to the person(s) designated by or under the plan to get those benefits (provided the designation clearly applies to those benefits) before paying those benefits to your spouse, children, parents, estate, or next of kin under the rules in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6) of this section.
(d)
Lump-sum payments to surviving spouses.
For a deceased participant whose benefit under § 4022.7(b) has a lump-sum value not exceeding the dollar amount specified in section 203(e)(1) of ERISA, payment will be made to the surviving spouse (if any) if such spouse would otherwise be entitled to receive a qualified preretirement survivor annuity under section 205(a)(2) of ERISA, and the surviving spouse will receive highest priority under paragraph (a) of this section.
[67 FR 16957, Apr. 8, 2002, as amended at 88 FR 44052, July 11, 2023]
§ 4022.94
What are the PBGC's rules on designating a person to get benefits the PBGC may owe me at the time of my death?
(a)
When you may designate.
At any time on or after the date we take over your plan, you may designate with us who will get any benefits we owe you at the time of your death.
(b)
Change of designee.
If you want to change the person(s) you designate with us, you must submit another designation to us.
(c)
If your designee dies before you
—(1)
In general.
If the person(s) you designate with us dies before you or at the same time as you, we will treat you as not having designated anyone with us (unless you named an alternate designee who survives you). Therefore, you should keep your designation with us current.
(2)
Simultaneous deaths.
If you and a person you designated die as a result of the same event, we will treat you and that person as having died at the same time, provided you and that person die within 30 days of each other.
§ 4022.95
Examples.
The following examples show how the rules in §§ 4022.91 through 4022.94 apply. For examples on how these rules apply in the case of a certain-and-continuous annuity, see § 4022.104.
At the time of his death, Charlie was receiving payments under a joint-and-survivor annuity. Charlie designated Ellen to receive survivor benefits under his joint-and-survivor annuity. We underpaid Charlie for periods before his death. At the time of his death, we owed Charlie a back payment to reimburse him for those underpayments.
(a)
Example 1: where surviving beneficiary is alive at participant's death.
Ellen survived Charlie. As explained in § 4022.91(b), because Ellen is entitled to survivor benefits under the joint-and-survivor annuity, we would pay Ellen the back payment.
(b)
Example 2: where surviving beneficiary predeceases participant.
Ellen died before Charlie. As explained in §§ 4022.91(b) and 4022.93, because benefits do not continue after Charlie's death under the joint-and-survivor annuity, we would pay the back payment to the person(s) Charlie designated to receive any payments we might owe him at the time of his death. If Charlie did not designate anyone to receive those payments or his designee died before him, we would pay the back payment to the person(s) surviving Charlie in the following order: spouse, children, parents, estate and next of kin.

Who will get benefits if I die when payments for future periods under a certain-and-continuous or similar annuity are owed upon my death?
If you die at a time when payments are owed for future periods under a form of annuity promising that, regardless of a participant's death, there will be annuity payments for a certain period of time (e.g., a certain-and-continuous annuity) or until a certain amount is paid (e.g., a cash-refund annuity or installment-refund annuity), and there is no surviving beneficiary designated to receive such payments, we will pay the remaining payments to the person determined under the rules in § 4022.93.
§ 4022.104
Examples.
The following examples show how the rules in §§ 4022.101 through 4022.103 and 4022.91 through 4022.94 apply in the case of a certain-and-continuous annuity.
(a)
C
C annuity with no underpayment.
At the time of his death, Charlie was receiving payments (in the correct amount) under a 5-year certain-and-continuous annuity. Charlie designated Ellen to receive any payments we might owe for periods after his death (but did not designate an alternate beneficiary to receive those payments in case Ellen died before him). Charlie died with three years of payments remaining.
(1)
Example 1: where surviving beneficiary predeceases participant.
Ellen died before Charlie. As explained in §§ 4022.103 and 4022.93, we would pay the remaining three years of payments to the person(s) surviving Charlie in the following order: spouse, children, parents, estate and next of kin.
(2)
Example 2: where surviving beneficiary dies during certain period.
Ellen survived Charlie and lived another year. We pay Ellen one year of payments. As explained in §§ 4022.103 and 4022.93, we would pay the remaining two years of payments to the person Ellen designated to receive any payments we might owe for periods after Ellen's death. If Ellen did not designate anyone to receive those payments or her designee died before her, we would pay the remaining year of payments to the person(s) surviving Ellen in the following order: spouse, children, parents, estate, next of kin.
(b)
C
C annuity with underpayment.
At the time of his death, Charlie was receiving payments under a 5-year certain-and-continuous annuity. Charlie designated Ellen to receive any payments we might owe for periods after his death. We underpaid Charlie for periods before his death. At the time of his death, we owed Charlie a back payment to reimburse him for those underpayments.
(1)
Example 3: where participant dies during certain period.
Charlie died with three years of payments remaining. Ellen survived Charlie and lived at least another three years. We pay Ellen the remaining three years of payments. As explained in § 4022.91(b), because
Ellen is entitled to survivor benefits under the certain-and-continuous annuity, we would pay Ellen the back payment for the underpayments to Charlie (and for any underpayments to Ellen).
(2)
Example 4: where participant and surviving beneficiary die during certain period.
Charlie died with three years of payments remaining. Ellen survived Charlie and lived another year. We paid Ellen one year of payments. Ellen designated Jean to receive any payments we might owe for periods after Ellen's death. Jean survived Ellen and lives at least another two years. We pay Jean the remaining two years of payments. As explained in § 4022.91(b), because Jean is entitled to survivor benefits under the certain-and-continuous annuity, we would pay Jean the back payment for the underpayments to Charlie (and for any underpayments to Ellen).
(3)
Example 5: where participant dies after certain period.
Charlie died after receiving seven years of payments. As explained in §§ 4022.91(b) and 4022.93, because benefits do not continue after Charlie's death under the certain-and-continuous annuity, we would pay the back payment to the person(s) Charlie designated to receive any payments we might owe him at the time of his death in case he died after the end of certain period. If Charlie did not designate anyone to receive those payments or his designee died before him, we would pay the back payment to the person(s) surviving Charlie in the following order: spouse, children, parents, estate and next of kin.

§ 4041.5
Record retention and availability.
(a)
Retention requirement
—(1)
Persons subject to requirement; records to be retained.
Each contributing sponsor and the plan administrator of a plan terminating in a standard termination, or in a distress termination that closes out in accordance with § 4041.50, must maintain all records necessary to demonstrate compliance with section 4041 of ERISA and this part. If a contributing sponsor or the plan administrator maintains information in accordance with this section, the other(s) need not maintain that information.

[62 FR 60428, Nov. 7, 1997, as amended at 81 FR 29766, May 13, 2016]
§ 4041.7
Challenges to plan termination under collective bargaining agreement.
(a)
Suspension upon formal challenge to termination
—(1)
Notice of formal challenge.
(i) If the PBGC is advised, before its review period under § 4041.26(a) ends, or before issuance of a notice of inability to determine sufficiency or a distribution notice under § 4041.47(b) or (c), that a formal challenge to the termination has been initiated as described in paragraph (c) of this section, the PBGC will suspend the termination proceeding and so advise the plan administrator in writing.
(ii) If the PBGC is advised of a challenge described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section after the time specified therein, the PBGC may suspend the termination proceeding and will so advise the plan administrator in writing.
(2)
Standard terminations.
During any period of suspension in a standard termination—
(i) The running of all time periods specified in ERISA or this part relevant to the termination will be suspended; and
(ii) The plan administrator must comply with the prohibitions in § 4041.22.
(3)
Distress terminations.
During any period of suspension in a distress termination—
(i) The issuance by the PBGC of any notice of inability to determine sufficiency or distribution notice will be stayed or, if any such notice was previously issued, its effectiveness will be stayed;
(ii) The plan administrator must comply with the prohibitions in § 4041.42; and
(iii) The plan administrator must file a distress termination notice with the PBGC pursuant to § 4041.45.
(b)
Existing collective bargaining agreement.
For purposes of this section, an existing collective bargaining agreement means a collective bargaining agreement that has not been made inoperative by a judicial ruling and, by its terms, either has not expired or is extended beyond its stated expiration date because neither of the collective bargaining parties took the required action to terminate it. When a collective bargaining agreement no longer meets these conditions, it ceases to be an “existing collective bargaining agreement,” whether or not any or all of its terms may continue to apply by operation of law.
(c)
Formal challenge to termination.
A formal challenge to a plan termination asserting that the termination would violate the terms and conditions of an existing collective bargaining agreement is initiated when—
(1) Any procedure specified in the collective bargaining agreement for resolving disputes under the agreement commences; or
(2) Any action before an arbitrator, administrative agency or board, or court under applicable labor-management relations law commences.
(d)
Resolution of challenge.
Immediately upon the final resolution of the challenge, the plan administrator must notify the PBGC in writing of the outcome of the challenge, provide the PBGC with a copy of any award or order, and, if the validity of the proposed termination has been upheld, advise the PBGC whether the proposed termination is to proceed. The final resolution ends the suspension period under paragraph (a) of this section.
(1)
Challenge sustained.
If the final resolution is that the proposed termination violates an existing collective bargaining agreement, the PBGC will dismiss the termination proceeding, all actions taken to effect the plan termination will be null and void, and the plan will be an ongoing plan. In this event, in a distress termination, § 4041.42(d) will apply as of the date of the dismissal by the PBGC.
(2)
Termination sustained.
If the final resolution is that the proposed termination does not violate an existing collective bargaining agreement and the plan administrator has notified the PBGC that the termination is to proceed, the PBGC will reactivate the termination proceeding by sending a written notice thereof to the plan administrator, and—
(i) The termination proceeding will continue from the point where it was suspended;
(ii) All actions taken to effect the termination before the suspension will be effective;
(iii) Any time periods that were suspended will resume running from the date of the PBGC's notice of the reactivation of the proceeding;
(iv) Any time periods that had fewer than 15 days remaining will be extended to the 15th day after the date of the PBGC's notice, or such later date as the PBGC may specify; and
(v) In a distress termination, the PBGC will proceed to issue a notice of inability to determine sufficiency or a distribution notice (or reactivate any such notice stayed under paragraph (a)(3) of this section), either with or
without first requesting updated information from the plan administrator pursuant to § 4041.45(c).
(e)
Final resolution of challenge.
A formal challenge to a proposed termination is finally resolved when—
(1) The parties involved in the challenge enter into a settlement that resolves the challenge;
(2) A final award, administrative decision, or court order is issued that is not subject to review or appeal; or
(3) A final award, administrative decision, or court order is issued that is not appealed, or review or enforcement of which is not sought, within the time for filing an appeal or requesting review or enforcement.
(f)
Involuntary termination by the PBGC.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the PBGC retains the authority in any case to initiate a plan termination in accordance with the provisions of section 4042 of ERISA.
§ 4041.8
Post-termination amendments.
(a)
Plan benefits.
A participant's or beneficiary's plan benefits are determined under the plan's provisions in effect on the plan's termination date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an amendment that is adopted after the plan's termination date is taken into account with respect to a participant's or beneficiary's plan benefits to the extent the amendment—
(1) Does not decrease the value of the participant's or beneficiary's plan benefits under the plan's provisions in effect on the termination date; and
(2) Does not eliminate or restrict any form of benefit available to the participant or beneficiary on the plan's termination date.
(b)
Residual assets.
In a plan in which participants or beneficiaries will receive some or all of the plan's residual assets based on an allocation formula, the amount of the plan's residual assets and each participant's or beneficiary's share thereof is determined under the plan's provisions in effect on the plan's termination date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an amendment adopted after the plan's termination date is taken into account with respect to a participant's or beneficiary's allocation of residual assets to the extent the amendment does not decrease the value of the participant's or beneficiary's allocation of residual assets under the plan's provisions in effect on the termination date.
(c)
Permitted decreases.
For purposes of this section, an amendment shall not be treated as decreasing the value of a participant's or beneficiary's plan benefits or allocation of residual assets to the extent—
(1) The decrease is necessary to meet a qualification requirement under section 401 of the Code;
(2) The participant's or beneficiary's allocation of residual assets is paid in the form of an increase in the participant's or beneficiary's plan benefits; or
(3) The decrease is offset by assets that would otherwise revert to the contributing sponsor or by additional contributions.
(d)
Distress terminations.
In the case of a distress termination, a participant's or beneficiary's benefit liabilities are determined as of the termination date in the same manner as plan benefits under this section.

# Subpart B—Standard Termination Process
§ 4041.21
Requirements for a standard termination.
(a)
Notice and distribution requirements.
A standard termination is valid if the plan administrator—
(1) Issues a notice of intent to terminate to all affected parties (other than the PBGC) in accordance with § 4041.23;
(2) Issues notices of plan benefits to all affected parties entitled to plan benefits in accordance with § 4041.24;
(3) Files a standard termination notice with the PBGC in accordance with § 4041.25;
(4) Distributes the plan's assets in satisfaction of plan benefits in accordance with § 4041.28(a) and (c); and
(5) In the case of a spin-off/termination transaction (as defined in § 4041.23(c)), issues the notices required by § 4041.23(c), § 4041.24(f), and § 4041.27(a)(2) in accordance with such sections.
(b)
Plan sufficiency
—(1)
Commitment to make plan sufficient.
A contributing sponsor of a plan or any other member of the plan's controlled group may make a commitment to contribute any
additional sums necessary to enable the plan to satisfy plan benefits in accordance with § 4041.28. A commitment will be valid only if—

(2)
Interests of participants.
The PBGC may decide not to issue a notice of noncompliance based on a failure to meet a requirement under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii) or (a)(1)(v) of this section if it determines that issuance of the notice would be inconsistent with the interests of participants and beneficiaries.
(3)
Continuing authority.
The PBGC may issue a notice of noncompliance or suspend the termination proceeding based on a failure to meet a requirement under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(v) of this section after expiration of the 60-day (or extended) time period prescribed by § 4041.26(a) (including upon audit) if the PBGC determines such action is necessary to carry out the purposes of Title IV.
(b)
Failure to meet distribution requirements
—(1)
In general.
If the PBGC determines, as part of an audit or otherwise, that the plan administrator has not satisfied any distribution requirement of § 4041.28(a) or (c), it may issue a notice of noncompliance.

Criteria.
In deciding whether to issue a notice of noncompliance under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the PBGC may consider—
(i) The nature and extent of the failure to satisfy a requirement of § 4041.28(a) or (c);
(ii) Any corrective action taken by the plan administrator; and
(iii) The interests of participants and beneficiaries.
(3)
Late distributions.
The PBGC will not issue a notice of noncompliance for failure to distribute timely based on any facts disclosed in the post-distribution certification if 60 or more days have passed from the PBGC's receipt of the post-distribution certification. The 60-day period may be extended by agreement between the plan administrator and the PBGC.

A plan administrator may request reconsideration of a notice of noncompliance in accordance with the rules prescribed in part 4003, subpart C.
(e)
Consequences of notice of noncompliance
—(1)
Effect on termination.
A notice of noncompliance ends the standard termination proceeding, nullifies all actions taken to terminate the plan, and renders the plan an ongoing plan. A notice of noncompliance is effective upon the expiration of the period within which the plan administrator may request reconsideration under paragraph (d) of this section or, if reconsideration is requested, a decision by the PBGC upholding the notice. However, once a notice is issued, the running of all time periods specified in ERISA or this part relevant to the termination will be suspended, and the plan administrator may take no further action to terminate the plan (except by initiation of a new termination) unless and until the notice is revoked. A plan administrator that still desires to terminate a plan must initiate the termination process again, starting with the issuance of a new notice of intent to terminate.
(2)
Effect on plan administration.
If the PBGC issues a notice of noncompliance, the prohibitions in § 4041.22(a)(1) and (a)(2) will cease to apply—
(i) Upon expiration of the period during which reconsideration may be requested or, if earlier, at the time the plan administrator decides not to request reconsideration; or
(ii) If reconsideration is requested, upon PBGC issuance of a decision on reconsideration upholding the notice of noncompliance.
(3)
Revocation of notice of noncompliance.
If a notice of noncompliance is revoked, unless the PBGC provides otherwise, any time period suspended by the issuance of the notice will resume running from the date of the revocation. In no case will the review period under § 4041.26(a) end less than 60 days from the date the PBGC received the standard termination notice.
(f)
If no notice of noncompliance is issued.
A standard termination is deemed to be valid if—
(1) The plan administrator files a standard termination notice under § 4041.25 and the PBGC does not issue a notice of noncompliance pursuant to § 4041.31(a); and
(2) The plan administrator files a post-distribution certification under § 4041.29 and the PBGC does not issue a notice of noncompliance pursuant to § 4041.31(b).
(g)
Notice to affected parties.
Upon a decision by the PBGC on reconsideration affirming the issuance of a notice of noncompliance or, if earlier, upon the plan administrator's decision not to request reconsideration, the plan administrator must notify the affected parties (other than the PBGC), and any persons who were provided notice under § 4041.23(c), in writing that the plan is not going to terminate or, if applicable, that the termination was invalid but that a new notice of intent to terminate is being issued.

# Subpart C—Distress Termination Process
§ 4041.41
Requirements for a distress termination.
(a)
Distress requirements.
A plan may be terminated in a distress termination only if—
(1) The plan administrator issues a notice of intent to terminate to each affected party in accordance with § 4041.43 at least 60 days and (except with PBGC approval) not more than 90 days before the proposed termination date;
(2) The plan administrator files a distress termination notice with the
PBGC in accordance with § 4041.45 no later than 120 days after the proposed termination date; and
(3) The PBGC determines that each contributing sponsor and each member of its controlled group satisfy one of the distress criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Effect of failure to satisfy requirements.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, if the plan administrator does not satisfy all of the requirements for a distress termination, any action taken to effect the plan termination is null and void, and the plan is an ongoing plan. A plan administrator who still desires to terminate the plan must initiate the termination process again, starting with the issuance of a new notice of intent to terminate.
(2)(i) The PBGC may, upon its own motion, waive any requirement with respect to notices to be filed with the PBGC under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section if the PBGC believes that it will be less costly or administratively burdensome to the PBGC to do so. The PBGC will not entertain requests for waivers under this paragraph.
(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the PBGC retains the authority in any case to initiate a plan termination in accordance with the provisions of section 4042 of ERISA.
(c)
Distress criteria.
In a distress termination, each contributing sponsor and each member of its controlled group must satisfy at least one (but not necessarily the same one) of the following criteria in order for a distress termination to occur:
(1)
Liquidation.
This criterion is met if, as of the proposed termination date—
(i) A person has filed or had filed against it a petition seeking liquidation in a case under title 11, United States Code, or under a similar federal law or law of a State or political subdivision of a State, or a case described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section has been converted to such a case; and
(ii) The case has not been dismissed.
(2)
Reorganization.
This criterion is met if—
(i) As of the proposed termination date, a person has filed or had filed against it a petition seeking reorganization in a case under title 11, United States Code, or under a similar law of a state or a political subdivision of a state, or a case described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section has been converted to such a case;
(ii) As of the proposed termination date, the case has not been dismissed;
(iii) The person notifies the PBGC of any request to the bankruptcy court (or other appropriate court in a case under such similar law of a state or a political subdivision of a state) for approval of the plan termination by concurrently filing with the PBGC a copy of the motion requesting court approval, including any documents submitted in support of the request; and
(iv) The bankruptcy court or other appropriate court determines that, unless the plan is terminated, such person will be unable to pay all its debts pursuant to a plan of reorganization and will be unable to continue in business outside the reorganization process and approves the plan termination.
(3)
Inability to continue in business.
This criterion is met if a person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the PBGC that, unless a distress termination occurs, the person will be unable to pay its debts when due and to continue in business.
(4)
Unreasonably burdensome pension costs.
This criterion is met if a person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the PBGC that the person's costs of providing pension coverage have become unreasonably burdensome solely as a result of declining covered employment under all single-employer plans for which that person is a contributing sponsor.
(d)
Non-duplicative efforts.
(1) If a person requests approval of the plan termination by a court, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the PBGC—
(i) Will normally enter an appearance to request that the court make specific findings as to whether the contributing sponsor or controlled group member meets the distress test in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or state that it is unable to make such findings;
(ii) Will provide the court with any information it has that may be germane to the court's ruling;
(iii) Will, if the person has requested, or later requests, a determination by the PBGC under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, defer action on the request until the court makes its determination; and
(iv) Will be bound by a final and non-appealable order of the court.
(2) If a person requests a determination by the PBGC under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the PBGC determines that the distress criterion is not met, and the person thereafter requests approval of the plan termination by a court, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the PBGC will advise the court of its determination and make its administrative record available to the court.
(e)
Non-recognition of certain actions.
If the PBGC finds that a person undertook any action or failed to act for the principal purpose of satisfying any of the distress criteria contained in paragraph (c) of this section, rather than for a reasonable business purpose, the PBGC will disregard such act or failure to act in determining whether the person has satisfied any of those criteria.
(f)
Requests for deadline extensions.
The PBGC may extend any deadline under this subpart in accordance with the rules described in section § 4041.30, except that the PBGC will not extend—
(1)
Pre-distribution deadlines.
The 60-day time limit under § 4041.43(a) for issuing the notice of intent to terminate; or
(2)
Post-distribution deadlines.
The deadline under § 4041.50 for filing the post-distribution certification.
§ 4041.42
Administration of plan during termination process.
(a)
General rule.
Except to the extent specifically prohibited by this section, during the pendency of termination proceedings the plan administrator must continue to carry out the normal operations of the plan, such as putting participants into pay status, collecting contributions due the plan, and investing plan assets.
(b)
Prohibitions after issuing notice of intent to terminate.
The plan administrator may not make loans to plan participants beginning on the first day he or she issues a notice of intent to terminate, and from that date until a distribution is permitted pursuant to § 4041.50, the plan administrator may not—
(1) Distribute plan assets pursuant to, or (except as required by this part) take any other actions to implement, the termination of the plan;
(2) Pay benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, in any form other than as an annuity; or
(3) Purchase irrevocable commitments to provide benefits from an insurer.
(c)
Limitation on benefit payments on or after proposed termination date.
Beginning on the proposed termination date, the plan administrator must reduce benefits to the level determined under part 4022, subpart D, of this chapter.
(d)
Failure to qualify for distress termination.
In any case where the PBGC determines, pursuant to § 4041.44(c) or § 4041.46(c)(1), that the requirements for a distress termination are not satisfied—
(1) The prohibitions in paragraph (b) of this section, other than those in paragraph (b)(1), will cease to apply—
(i) Upon expiration of the period during which reconsideration may be requested under §§ 4041.44(e) and 4041.46(e) or, if earlier, at the time the plan administrator decides not to request reconsideration; or
(ii) If reconsideration is requested, upon PBGC issuance of its decision on reconsideration.
(2) Any benefits that were not paid pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section will be due and payable as of the effective date of the PBGC's determination, together with interest from the date (or dates) on which the unpaid amounts were originally due until the date on which they are paid in full at the rate or rates prescribed under § 4022.81(c)(3) of this chapter.
(e)
Effect of subsequent insufficiency.
If the plan administrator makes a finding of subsequent insufficiency for guaranteed benefits pursuant to § 4041.49(b), or the PBGC notifies the plan administrator that it has made a finding of subsequent insufficiency for guaranteed benefits pursuant to § 4041.40(d), the prohibitions in paragraph (b) of
this section will apply in accordance with § 4041.49(e).
[62 FR 60428, Nov. 7, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 29355, May 29, 1998]

(9) A statement, if applicable, that benefits may be subject to reduction because of the limitations on the amounts guaranteed by the PBGC or because plan assets are insufficient to pay for full benefits (pursuant to part 4022, subparts B and D, of this chapter) and that payments in excess of the amount guaranteed by the PBGC may be recouped by the PBGC (pursuant to part 4022, subpart E, of this chapter).
(c)

In the case of a spin-off/termination transaction (as described in § 4041.23(c)), the plan administrator must provide all participants and beneficiaries in the original plan who are also participants or beneficiaries in the ongoing plan (as of the proposed termination date) with a notice describing the transaction no later than the date on which the plan administrator completes the issuance of notices of intent to terminate under this section.
§ 4041.44
PBGC review of notice of intent to terminate.
(a)
General.
When a notice of intent to terminate is filed with it, the PBGC—
(1) Will determine whether the notice was issued in compliance with § 4041.43; and
(2) Will advise the plan administrator of its determination, in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, no later than the proposed termination date specified in the notice.
(b)
Tentative finding of compliance.
If the PBGC determines that the issuance of the notice of intent to terminate appears to be in compliance with § 4041.43, it will notify the plan administrator in writing that—
(1) The PBGC has made a tentative determination of compliance;

(1) That the PBGC has determined that the notice of intent to terminate was not properly issued; and
(2) That the proposed distress termination is null and void and the plan is an ongoing plan.
(d)
Information on need to institute section 4042 proceedings.
The PBGC may require the plan administrator to submit, within 20 days after the plan administrator's receipt of the PBGC's written request (or such other period as may be specified in such written request), any information that the PBGC determines it needs in order to decide whether to institute termination or trusteeship proceedings pursuant to section 4042 of ERISA, whenever—
(1) A notice of intent to terminate indicates that benefits currently in pay status (or that should be in pay status) are not being paid or that this is likely to occur within the 180-day period following the issuance of the notice of intent to terminate;
(2) The PBGC issues a determination under paragraph (c) of this section; or
(3) The PBGC has any reason to believe that it may be necessary or appropriate to institute proceedings under section 4042 of ERISA.
(e)
Reconsideration of finding of noncompliance.
A plan administrator may request reconsideration of the PBGC's determination of noncompliance under paragraph (c) of this section in accordance with the rules prescribed in part 4003, subpart C, of this chapter. Any request for reconsideration automatically stays the effectiveness of the determination until the PBGC issues its decision on reconsideration, but does not stay the time period within which information must be submitted to the PBGC in response to a request under paragraph (d) of this section.
(f)
Notice to affected parties.
Upon a decision by the PBGC affirming a finding of noncompliance or upon the expiration of the period within which the plan administrator may request reconsideration of a finding of noncompliance (or, if earlier, upon the plan administrator's decision not to request reconsideration), the plan administrator must notify the affected parties (and any persons who were provided notice under § 4041.43(e)) in writing that the plan is not going to terminate or, if applicable, that the termination is invalid but that a new notice of intent to terminate is being issued.
§ 4041.45
Distress termination notice.
(a)
General rule.
The plan administrator must file with the PBGC a PBGC Form 601, Distress Termination Notice, Single-Employer Plan Termination, with Schedule EA-D, Distress Termination Enrolled Actuary Certification, that has been completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, on or before the 120th day after the proposed termination date.
(b)
Participant and benefit information
—(1)
Plan insufficient for guaranteed benefits.
Unless the enrolled actuary certifies, in the Schedule EA-D filed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, that the plan is sufficient either for guaranteed benefits or for benefit liabilities, the plan administrator must file with the PBGC the participant and benefit information described in PBGC Form 601 and the instructions thereto by the later of—
(i) 120 days after the proposed termination date, or
(ii) 30 days after receipt of the PBGC's determination, pursuant to § 4041.46(b), that the requirements for a distress termination have been satisfied.
(2)
Plan sufficient for guaranteed benefits or benefit liabilities.
If the enrolled
actuary certifies that the plan is sufficient either for guaranteed benefits or for benefit liabilities, the plan administrator need not submit the participant and benefit information described in PBGC Form 601 and the instructions thereto unless requested to do so pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
(3)
Effect of failure to provide information.
The PBGC may void the distress termination if the plan administrator fails to provide complete participant and benefit information in accordance with this section.
(c)
Additional information.
The PBGC may in any case require the submission of any additional information that it needs to make the determinations that it is required to make under this part or to pay benefits pursuant to section 4061 or 4022(c) of ERISA. The plan administrator must submit any information requested under this paragraph within 30 days after receiving the PBGC's written request (or such other period as may be specified in such written request).
§ 4041.46
PBGC determination of compliance with requirements for distress termination.
(a)
General.
Based on the information contained and submitted with the PBGC Form 600 and the PBGC Form 601, with Schedule EA-D, and on any information submitted by an affected party or otherwise obtained by the PBGC, the PBGC will determine whether the requirements for a distress termination set forth in § 4041.41(c) have been met and will notify the plan administrator in writing of its determination, in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
(b)
Qualifying termination.
If the PBGC determines that all of the requirements of § 4041.41(c) have been satisfied, it will so advise the plan administrator and will also advise the plan administrator of whether participant and benefit information must be submitted in accordance with § 4041.45(b).
(c)
Non-qualifying termination.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the PBGC determines that any of the requirements of § 4041.41 have not been met, it will notify the plan administrator of its determination, the basis therefor, and the effect thereof (as provided in § 4041.41(b)).
(2) If the only basis for the PBGC's determination described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is that the distress termination notice is incomplete, the PBGC will advise the plan administrator of the missing item(s) of information and that the information must be filed with the PBGC no later than the 120th day after the proposed termination date or the 30th day after the date of the PBGC's notice of its determination, whichever is later.
(d)
Reconsideration of determination of non-qualification.
A plan administrator may request reconsideration of the PBGC's determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section in accordance with the rules prescribed in part 4003, subpart C, of this chapter. The filing of a request for reconsideration automatically stays the effectiveness of the determination until the PBGC issues its decision on reconsideration.
(e)
Notice to affected parties.
Upon a decision by the PBGC affirming a determination of non-qualification or upon the expiration of the period within which the plan administrator may request reconsideration of a determination of non-qualification (or, if earlier, upon the plan administrator's decision not to request reconsideration), the plan administrator must notify the affected parties (and any persons who were provided notice under § 4041.43(e)) in writing that the plan is not going to terminate or, if applicable, that the termination is invalid but that a new notice of intent to terminate is being issued.
§ 4041.47
PBGC determination of plan sufficiency/insufficiency.
(a)
General.
Upon receipt of participant and benefit information filed pursuant to § 4041.45 (b)(1) or (c), the PBGC will determine the degree to which the plan is sufficient and notify the plan administrator in writing of its determination in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
(b)
Insufficiency for guaranteed benefits.
If the PBGC finds that it is unable to determine that a plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits, it will issue a

(2) The termination will be completed under section 4042 of ERISA.
(c)
Sufficiency for guaranteed benefits or benefit liabilities.

(1) To issue notices of benefit distribution in accordance with § 4041.48;
(2) To close out the plan in accordance with § 4041.50;
(3) To file a timely post-distribution certification with the PBGC in accordance with § 4041.50(b); and
(4) That either the plan administrator or the contributing sponsor must preserve and maintain plan records in accordance with § 4041.5.
(d)
Alternative treatment of majority owner's benefit.
A majority owner may elect to forgo receipt of all or part of his or her plan benefits in connection with a distress termination. Any such alternative treatment—
(1) Is valid only if the conditions in § 4041.21(b)(2)(i) through (iv) are met (except that, in the case of a plan that does not distribute assets pursuant to § 4041.50, the majority owner may make the election and the spouse may consent any time on or after the date of issuance of the first notice of intent to terminate); and—
(2) Is subject to the PBGC's approval if the election—
(i) Is made after the termination date; and
(ii) Would result in the PBGC determining that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits under paragraph (c).
§ 4041.48
Sufficient plans; notice requirements.
(a)
Notices of benefit distribution.
When a distribution notice is issued by the PBGC pursuant to § 4041.47, the plan administrator must issue notices of benefit distribution in accordance with the rules regarding notices of plan benefits in § 4041.24, except that—
(1) The deadline for issuing the notices of benefit distribution is the 60th day after receipt of the distribution notice; and
(2) With respect to the information described in § 4041.24 (b) through (e), the term “plan benefits” is replaced with “title IV benefits” and the term “proposed termination date” is replaced with “termination date”.

—(1)
In general.
Unless all title IV benefits will be distributed in the form of nonconsensual lump sums, the plan administrator must provide a notice of annuity information to each affected party other than—

§ 4041.49
Verification of plan sufficiency prior to closeout.
(a)
General rule.
Before distributing plan assets pursuant to a closeout under § 4041.50, the plan administrator must verify whether the plan's assets are still sufficient to provide for benefits at the level determined by the PBGC,
i.e.,
guaranteed benefits or benefit liabilities. If the plan administrator finds that the plan is no longer able to provide for benefits at the level determined by the PBGC, then paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as appropriate, will apply.
(b)
Subsequent insufficiency for guaranteed benefits.
When a plan administrator finds that a plan is no longer sufficient for guaranteed benefits, the plan administrator must promptly notify the PBGC in writing of that fact and may take no further action to implement the plan termination, pending the PBGC's determination and notice pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.
(1)
PBGC concurrence with finding.
If the PBGC concurs with the plan administrator's finding, the distribution notice will be void, and the PBGC will—
(i) Issue the plan administrator a notice of inability to determine sufficiency in accordance with § 4041.47(b); and
(ii) Require the plan administrator to submit a new valuation, certified to by an enrolled actuary, of the benefit liabilities and guaranteed benefits under the plan, valued in accordance with §§ 4044.41 through 4044.58 of this chapter as of the date of the plan administrator's notice to the PBGC.

Subsequent insufficiency for benefit liabilities.
When a plan administrator finds that a plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits but is no longer sufficient for benefit liabilities, the plan administrator must immediately notify the PBGC in writing of this fact, but must continue with the distribution of assets in accordance with § 4041.50.
(d)
Finding by PBGC of subsequent insufficiency.
In any case in which the PBGC finds on its own initiative that a subsequent insufficiency for guaranteed benefits has occurred, paragraph (b)(1) of this section will apply, except that the guaranteed benefits must be revalued as of the date of the PBGC's finding.
(e)
Restrictions upon finding of subsequent insufficiency.
When the plan administrator makes the finding described in paragraph (b) of this section or receives notice that the PBGC has made the finding described in paragraph (d) of this section, the plan administrator is (except to the extent the PBGC otherwise directs) subject to the prohibitions in § 4041.42.

(c) For purposes of applying the distribution deadline in § 4041.28(a)(1)(ii), the phrase “the requirements of § 4041.25(c)” is replaced with “the requirements of § 4041.48(d)”.

(2)
Funding level determination.
Upon the plan sponsor's receipt of each actuarial valuation under paragraph (a) of this section, the plan sponsor must determine whether the value of nonforfeitable benefits exceeds the value of plan assets (including withdrawal liability claims). If it does, then the plan sponsor must—
(i) Amend the plan to reduce benefits subject to reduction (if any) in accordance with the procedures in subpart C of part 4281 of this chapter to the extent necessary to ensure that the plan's assets are sufficient to discharge when due all of the plan's obligations
with respect to nonforfeitable benefits or, if that result cannot be achieved, to the maximum extent possible; and
(ii) If, after implementing the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the plan's assets are insufficient to discharge when due all of the plan's obligations with respect to nonforfeitable benefits, make determinations of plan solvency in accordance with § 4041A.25.

(ii) The present value of the plan's nonforfeitable benefits does not exceed $50 million according to the most recent actuarial valuation under paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
Alternative compliance requirements.
A plan sponsor is considered to comply with the actuarial valuation and filing requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if both—

(ii) If, within 90 days after the plan sponsor makes the filing described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, PBGC requests other information reasonably required to determine the plan's assets and liabilities, the plan sponsor files such other information within 60 days after PBGC's request.
(3)
Information to be provided.

Periodic determinations of plan solvency.
(a)
Annual insolvency determination.
A plan that has no benefits subject to reduction and has assets insufficient to discharge when due all of the plan's obligations with respect to nonforfeitable benefits must make periodic determinations of plan solvency in accordance with this paragraph (a). No later than six months before the beginning of the applicable plan year described in this paragraph (a), or as soon as practicable after the plan sponsor determines the applicable plan year, and no later than six months before each plan year thereafter, the plan sponsor must determine in writing whether the plan is expected to be insolvent for such plan year. The applicable plan year is—
(1) For a plan that had no benefits subject to reduction when it terminated, the plan year the plan terminated; or
(2) For a plan that eliminated benefits subject to reduction by amendment after termination, the plan year in which the amendment that eliminated all (or all remaining) benefits subject to reduction is effective.
(b)
Other determination of insolvency.
Whether or not a prior determination of plan insolvency has been made under paragraph (a) of this section (or under section 4245 of ERISA), a plan sponsor that has reason to believe, taking into account the plan's recent and anticipated financial experience, that the plan is insolvent in the current plan year or is expected to be insolvent in the next plan year must determine in writing whether the plan is or is expected to be insolvent for that plan year.
(c)
Benefit suspensions.
If the plan sponsor determines that the plan is, or is expected to be, insolvent for a plan year, it must suspend benefits in accordance with § 4281.41.
(d)
Insolvency notices.
If the plan sponsor determines that the plan is insolvent in the current plan year or is expected to be insolvent in the next plan year it must provide notices of insolvency and notices of insolvency benefit level to PBGC and to participants and beneficiaries in accordance with subpart D of part 4281 of this chapter.
[61 FR 34052, July 1, 1996, as amended at 80 FR 55745, Sept. 17, 2015; 84 FR 18723, May 2, 2019]
§ 4041A.26
Financial assistance.
A plan sponsor that determines a resource benefit level under section 4245(b)(2) of ERISA that is below the level of guaranteed benefits or that determines that the plan will be unable to pay guaranteed benefits for any month during an insolvency year shall apply for financial assistance from the PBGC in accordance with § 4281.47.
§ 4041A.27
PBGC approval to pay benefits not otherwise permitted.
Upon written application by the plan sponsor, the PBGC may authorize the plan to pay benefits other than nonforfeitable benefits or to pay benefits valued at more than $1,750 in a form other than an annuity. The PBGC will approve such payments if it determines that the plan sponsor has demonstrated that the payments are not adverse to the interests of the plan's participants and beneficiaries generally and do not unreasonably increase the PBGC's risk of loss with respect to the plan.

# Subpart D—Closeout of Sufficient Plans
§ 4041A.41
General rule.
If a plan's assets, excluding any claim of the plan for unpaid withdrawal liability, are sufficient to satisfy all obligations for nonforfeitable benefits provided under the plan, the plan sponsor may close out the plan in accordance with this subpart by distributing plan assets in full satisfaction of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.
§ 4041A.42
Method of distribution.

(b)
Missing participants and beneficiaries.
The plan sponsor must distribute plan benefits of missing distributees in accordance with subpart D of part 4050 of this chapter.
[61 FR 34052, July 1, 1996, as amended at 82 FR 60818, Dec. 22, 2017]

(2) The payment is for death benefits provided under the plan.
(3) The participant elects an alternative form of distribution under paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Alternative forms of distribution.

The notification shall also describe any risks attendant to the alternative form. Participants' elections of alternative forms shall be in writing.
[61 FR 34052, July 1, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 38306, July 16, 1998; 88 FR 76664, Nov. 7, 2023; 89 FR 48300, June 6, 2024]

§ 4043.3
Requirement of notice.
(a)
Obligation to file
—(1)
In general.
Each person that is required to file a notice under this part, or a duly authorized representative, must submit the information required under this part by the time specified in § 4043.20 (for post-event notices), § 4043.61 (for advance notices), or § 4043.81 (for Form 200 filings). Any information filed with PBGC in connection with another matter may be incorporated by reference. If an event is subject to both post-event and advance notice requirements, the notice filed first satisfies both filing requirements.
(2)
Multiple plans.
If a reportable event occurs for more than one plan, the filing obligation with respect to each plan is independent of the filing obligation with respect to any other plan.
(3)
Optional consolidated filing.
A filing of a notice with respect to a reportable event by any person required to file will be deemed to be a filing by all persons required to give PBGC notice of the event under this part. If notices are required for two or more events, the notices may be combined in one filing.
(b)
Contents of reportable event notice.
A person required to file a reportable event notice under subpart B or C of this part must file, by the notice date, the form specified by PBGC for that purpose, with the information specified in PBGC's reportable events instructions.
(c)
Reportable event forms and instructions.
PBGC will issue reportable events forms and instructions and make them available on its website (
http://www.pbgc.gov
).
(d)
Requests for additional information.
PBGC may, in any case, require the submission of additional relevant information not specified in its forms and instructions. Any such information must be submitted for subpart B of this part within 30 days, and for subpart C or D of this part within 7 days, after the date of a written request by PBGC, or within a different time period specified therein. PBGC may in its discretion shorten the time period where it determines that the interests of PBGC or participants may be prejudiced by a delay in receipt of the information.
(e)
Effect of failure to file.
If a notice (or any other information required under this part) is not provided within the specified time limit, PBGC may pursue any equitable or legal remedies available to it under the law, including assessing against each person required
to provide the notice a separate penalty under section 4071 of ERISA.
[80 FR 55002, Sept. 11, 2015, as amended at 85 FR 6061, Feb. 4, 2020]
§ 4043.4
Waivers and extensions.
(a)
Waivers and extensions—in general.
PBGC may extend any deadline or waive any other requirement under this part where it finds convincing evidence that the waiver or extension is appropriate under the circumstances. Any waiver or extension may be subject to conditions. A request for a waiver or extension must be filed with PBGC in writing (which may be in electronic form) and must state the facts and circumstances on which the request is based.
(b)
Waivers and extensions—specific events.
For some reportable events, automatic waivers from reporting and extensions of time are provided in subparts B and C of this part. If an occurrence constitutes two or more reportable events, reporting requirements for each event are determined independently. For example, reporting is automatically waived for an occurrence that constitutes a reportable event under more than one section only if the requirements for an automatic waiver under each section are satisfied.
(c)
Multiemployer plans.
The requirements of section 4043 of ERISA are waived with respect to multiemployer plans.
(d)
Terminating plans.
No notice is required from the plan administrator or contributing sponsor of a plan if the notice date is on or after the date on which—
(1) All of the plan's assets (other than any excess assets) are distributed pursuant to a termination under part 4041 of this chapter; or
(2) A trustee is appointed for the plan under section 4042 of ERISA.
(e)
Events not described in this part.
Notice of a reportable event described in section 4043(c) of ERISA is waived except to the extent that reporting is required under this part.
§ 4043.5
How and where to file.
Reportable event notices required under this part must be filed electronically in accordance with the instructions posted on PBGC's Web site,
http://www.pbgc.gov
. Filing guidance is provided by the instructions and by subpart A of part 4000 of this chapter.
§ 4043.6
Date of filing.
(a)
Post-event notice filings.
PBGC applies the rules in subpart C of part 4000 of this chapter to determine the date that a submission under subpart B of this part was filed with PBGC.
(b)
Advance notice and Form 200 filings.
Information filed under subpart C or D of this part is treated as filed on the date it is received by PBGC. Subpart C of part 4000 of this chapter provides rules for determining when PBGC receives a submission.
§ 4043.7
Computation of time.
PBGC applies the rules in subpart D of part 4000 of this chapter to compute any time period under this part.
§ 4043.8
Confidentiality.
In accordance with section 4043(f) of ERISA and § 4901.21(a) of this chapter, any information or documentary material that is not publicly available and is submitted to PBGC pursuant to subpart B or C of this part will not be made public, except as may be relevant to any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or for disclosures to either body of Congress or to any duly authorized committee or subcommittee of the Congress. This provision does not apply to information or material submitted to PBGC pursuant to subpart D of this part, even where the submission serves as an alternative method of compliance with § 4043.25.

§ 4043.9
Company low-default-risk safe harbor.
(a)
Low-default-risk.
An entity (a “company”) that is a contributing sponsor of a plan or the highest level U.S. parent of a contributing sponsor is “low-default-risk” on the date of an event if that date falls within a safe harbor period of the company as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Safe harbor period.
A safe harbor period for a company means a period that—
(1) Begins on a financial information date (as described in paragraph (c) of
this section) on which the company satisfies the low-default-risk standard in paragraph (e) of this section, and
(2) Ends 13 months later or (if earlier) on the company's next financial information date.
(c)
Financial information date.
A financial information date for a company means—
(1) A date on which the company files on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) audited annual financial statements (including balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, and notes to the financial statements) for the company's most recent completed fiscal year preceding the date of such filing;
(2) The date (the “closing date”) on which the company closes the annual accounting period that results in the production of audited or unaudited annual financial statements for the company's most recent completed fiscal year preceding the closing date, if audited annual financial statements are not required to be filed with the SEC; or
(3) A date on which the company files with IRS an annual federal income tax return or IRS Form 990 (in either case, a “return”) for the company's most recent completed fiscal year preceding the date of such filing, if at the time the return is filed there are no annual financial statements for the year of the return.
(d)
Supporting financial information.
For purposes of this section, the “supporting financial information” is the annual financial statements or return associated with the establishment of the financial information date.
(e)
Low-default-risk standard
—(1)
Adequate capacity.
For purposes of this part, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, a company meets the low-default-risk standard as of a financial information date (the “qualifying date”) if the company has adequate capacity to meet its obligations in full and on time on the qualifying date as evidenced by satisfying either:
(i) Both of the criteria described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, or
(ii) Any four of the seven criteria described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section.
(2)
Criteria evidencing adequate capacity.
The criteria referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are:
(i) The probability that the company will default on its financial obligations is not more than four percent over the next five years or not more than 0.4 percent over the next year, in either case determined on the basis of widely available third-party financial information on the company's credit quality.
(ii) The company's secured debt (disregarding leases and debt incurred to acquire or improve property and secured only by that property) does not exceed 10 percent of the company's total assets.
(iii) The company has a ratio of retained-earnings-to-total-assets of 0.25 or more.
(iv) The company has a ratio of total-debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of 3.0 or less.
(v) The company has positive net income for the two most recently completed fiscal years preceding the qualifying date.
(vi) During the two-year period ending on the qualifying date, the company has not experienced an event described in § 4043.34(a)(1) or (2) (dealing with a default on a loan with an outstanding balance of $10 million or more) with respect to any loan with an outstanding balance of $10 million or more to the company regardless of whether reporting was waived under § 4043.34(b).
(vii) During the two-year period ending on the qualifying date, there has not been any failure to make when due any contribution described in § 4043.25(a)(1) or (2) (dealing with failure to make required minimum funding payments), unless reporting was waived under § 4043.25(c).
(3)
Using financial information to evaluate criteria.
(i) Subject to paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to evaluating the criterion described in paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section, to evaluate whether criteria described in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) through (v) of this section are met, a
company must use the supporting financial information described in paragraph (d) of this section associated with the qualifying date.
(ii) In addition to the use of the supporting financial information to evaluate criteria as described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, to evaluate whether the criterion described in paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section is met, the company must also use the supporting financial information as described in paragraph (d) of this section associated with the financial information date for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year covered by the supporting financial information associated with the qualifying date.
(iii) For purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section, the excess of total revenue over total expenses as reported on the IRS Form 990 is considered to be net income.
(4)
Exception.
If a company receives an audit or review report for supporting financial information described in paragraph (d) of this section associated with the qualifying date that expresses a material adverse view or qualification, the company does not satisfy the low-default-risk standard.
[80 FR 55002, Sept. 11, 2015, as amended at 85 FR 6061, Feb. 4, 2020]
§ 4043.10
Well-funded plan safe harbor.
For purposes of this part, a plan is in the well-funded plan safe harbor for an event year if no variable-rate premium was required to be paid for the plan under parts 4006 and 4007 of this chapter for the plan year preceding the event year.

# Subpart B—Post-Event Notice of Reportable Events
§ 4043.20
Post-event filing obligation.
The plan administrator and each contributing sponsor of a plan for which a reportable event under this subpart has occurred are required to notify PBGC within 30 days after that person knows or has reason to know that the reportable event has occurred, unless a waiver or extension applies. If there is a change in plan administrator or contributing sponsor, the responsibility for any failure to file or defective filing lies with the person who is the plan administrator or contributing sponsor of the plan on the 30th day after the reportable event occurs.
§ 4043.21
Tax disqualification and Title I noncompliance.
(a)
Reportable event.
A reportable event occurs when the Secretary of the Treasury issues notice that a plan has ceased to be a plan described in section 4021(a)(2) of ERISA, or when the Secretary of Labor determines that a plan is not in compliance with title I of ERISA.
(b)
Waiver.
Notice is waived for this event.
§ 4043.22
Amendment decreasing benefits payable.
(a)
Reportable event.
A reportable event occurs when an amendment to a plan is adopted under which the retirement benefit payable from employer contributions with respect to any participant may be decreased.
(b)
Waiver.
Notice is waived for this event.
§ 4043.23
Active participant reduction.
(a)
Reportable event.
A reportable event occurs for a plan:
(1)
Single-cause event.
(i) On each date in a plan year when, as a result of a new single cause, the ratio of the aggregate number of individuals who ceased to be active participants because of that single-cause, to the number of active participants at the beginning of such plan year, exceeds 20 percent.
(ii) Examples of single-cause events include a reorganization or restructuring, the discontinuance of an operation or business, a natural disaster, a mass layoff, or an early retirement incentive program.
(2)
Attrition event.
At the end of a plan year if the sum of the number of active participants covered by the plan at the end of such plan year, plus the number of individuals who ceased to be active participants during the same plan year that are reported to PBGC under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is less than 80 percent of the number of active participants at the beginning of such plan year.
(b)
Determination rules
—(1)
Determination dates.
The number of active participants at the beginning of a plan year may be determined by using the number of active participants at the end of the previous plan year, and the number of active participants at the end of a plan year may be determined by using the number of active participants at the beginning of the next plan year.
(2)
Active participant.
“Active participant” for purposes of this section means a participant who—
(i) Is receiving compensation from any member of the plan's controlled group for work performed for any member of the plan's controlled group;
(ii) Is on paid or unpaid leave granted for a reason other than a layoff;
(iii) Is laid off from work for a period of time that has lasted less than 30 days; or
(iv) Is absent from work due to a recurring reduction in employment that occurs at least annually.
(3)
Employment relationship.
For purposes of determining whether a participant is an active participant, a participant does not cease to be active if the participant leaves employment with one member of a plan's controlled group to become employed by another controlled group member.
(c)
Reductions due to cessations and withdrawals.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a reduction in the number of active participants is to be disregarded to the extent that it—
(1) Is attributable to an event described in sections 4062(e) or 4063(a) of ERISA, and
(2) Is timely reported to PBGC under section 4062(e) and/or section 4063(a) of ERISA before the due date of the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section.
(d)
Waivers
—(1)
Small plan.
Notice under this section is waived if the plan had 100 or fewer participants for whom flat-rate premiums were payable for the plan year preceding the event year.
(2)
Low-default-risk.
Notice under this section is waived if each contributing sponsor of the plan and the highest level U.S. parent of each contributing sponsor are low-default-risk on the date of the event.
(3)
Well-funded plan.
Notice under this section is waived if the plan is in the well-funded plan safe harbor for the event year.
(4)
Public company.
Notice under this section is waived if any contributing sponsor of the plan before the transaction, or the parent company within a parent-subsidiary controlled group of any such contributing sponsor, is a public company and timely files a SEC Form 8-K disclosing the event under an item of the Form 8-K other than under Item 2.02 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) or in financial statements under Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits).
(5)
Statutory events.
Notice is waived for an active participant reduction event described in section 4043(c)(3) of ERISA except to the extent required under this section.
(e)
Extension—attrition event.
For an event described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the notice date is extended until the premium due date for the plan year following the event year.
(f)
Examples
—(1)
Determining whether a single-cause event occurred (Example 1).
A calendar-year plan had 1,000 active participants at the beginning of the current plan year. As the result of a business unit being shut down, 160 participants are permanently laid off on July 30. Before July 30, and as part of the course of regular business operations, some active participants terminated employment, some retired and some new hires became covered by the plan. Because reductions due to attrition are disregarded for purposes of determining whether a single-cause event has occurred, it is not necessary for the sponsor to tabulate an exact active participant count as of July 30. Rather, the relevant percentage for determining whether a single-cause event occurred is determined by dividing the number of active participants laid-off as a result of the business unit shut down to the beginning of year active participant count. Because that ratio is less than 20 percent (
i.e.,
160/1,000 = .16, or 16 percent), a single-cause event under paragraph (a)(1) of this section did not occur on July 30. However, if, as a result of the business unit shutdown, additional layoffs occur later in the same year, a single-cause event
may subsequently be triggered (See Example 3 in paragraph (f)(3) of this section).
(2)
Determining whether an attrition event occurred in year when a single-cause event occurred (Example 2)
. (i) Assume the same facts as in Example 1 in paragraph (f)(1) of this section except that the number of active participants laid off on July 30 was 230 and thus, a single-cause event occurred. Further, assume that the event was timely reported to PBGC (
i.e.,
on or before August 30). Lastly, assume the active participant count as of year-end is 600.
(ii) To prevent duplicative reporting (
i.e.,
to ensure that the participants who triggered a single-cause reporting requirement do not also trigger an attrition event), the 230 participants who triggered that single-cause reporting requirement are not taken into account for purposes of determining whether an attrition event occurred. This is accomplished by increasing the year-end count by 230. Therefore, the applicable percentage for the attrition determination is 83 percent (
i.e.,
(600 + 230)/1,000 = .83). Because 83 percent is greater than 80 percent, an attrition event has not occurred.
(3)
Single-cause event spread out over multiple dates (Example 3).
(i) Assume the same facts as in Example 1 in paragraph (f)(1) of this section except that the layoffs resulting from the business unit shut down are spread out over several months. Table 1 to paragraph (f)(3) summarizes the applicable calculations:
Table 1 to Paragraph (
f
)(3)
Single-cause event spread out over multiple dates
Date
Number laid-off
Aggregate reduction
Applicable percentage
February 1
50
50
50/1,000 = 5 percent.
May 15
50
100
100/1,000 = 10 percent.
September 1
110
210
210/1,000 = 21 percent.
November 1
40
250
250/1,000 = 25 percent.
(ii) A single-cause event occurs on September 1 because that is the first time the applicable percentage exceeds 20 percent. This event must be reported by October 1. The November 1 layoff does not trigger a subsequent single-cause event because the layoff is part of the same single-cause event already timely reported to PBGC. However, they will be considered in the determination of whether an attrition event occurs at year-end as explained in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
(iii) As illustrated in Example 2 in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, for purposes of determining whether an attrition event has occurred, the year-end count is increased by the number of participants that triggered a single-cause event. In this case, that number is 210. The fact that an additional 40 active participants were laid off as a result of the business unit shut down after the single-cause event occurred does not affect the calculation because it was not already reported to PBGC. For example, if the year-end active participant count is 560, the number that gets compared to the beginning-of-year active participant count is 770 (
i.e.,
560 + 210 = 770). Because 770 is less than 80 percent of 1,000, an attrition event has occurred and must be reported.
(4)
Multiple single-cause events in same plan year (Example 4).
Assume the same facts as in Example 1 in paragraph (f)(1) of this section except that the July 30 shutdown of the business unit resulted in 205 layoffs on that date. A single-cause event occurred and is timely reported. Later in the same plan year, the company announces an early retirement incentive program and 210 employees participate in the program with the last employees participating in the program retiring on November 15 of the plan year. A new single-cause event has occurred as of November 15 resulting in a reporting obligation of the active participant reduction due to the retirement incentive program (210/1000 = 21 percent).
[85 FR 6061, Feb. 4, 2020]
§ 4043.24
Termination or partial termination.
(a)
Reportable event.
A reportable event occurs when the Secretary of the Treasury determines that there has been a termination or partial termination of a plan within the meaning of section 411(d)(3) of the Code.
(b)
Waiver.
Notice is waived for this event.
§ 4043.25
Failure to make required minimum funding payment.
(a)
Reportable event.
A reportable event occurs when—
(1) A contribution required under sections 302 and 303 of ERISA or sections 412 and 430 of the Code is not made by the due date for the payment under ERISA section 303(j) or Code section 430(j), or
(2) Any other contribution required as a condition of a funding waiver is not made when due.
(b)
Alternative method of compliance—Form 200 filed.
If, with respect to the same failure, a filing is made in accordance with § 4043.81, that filing (while not considered to be submitted to PBGC pursuant to section 4043 of ERISA for purposes of section 4043(f) of ERISA) satisfies the requirements of this section.
(c)
Waivers
—(1)
Small plan.
Notice under this section is waived with respect to a failure to make a required quarterly contribution under section 303(j)(3) of ERISA or section 430(j)(3) of the Code if the plan had 100 or fewer participants for whom flat-rate premiums were payable for the plan year preceding the event year.
(2)
30-day grace period.
Notice under this section is waived if the missed contribution is made by the 30th day after its due date.
(3)
Late funding balance election.
Notice under this section is waived if the failure to make a timely required contribution is solely because of the plan sponsor's failure to timely make a funding balance election.
§ 4043.26
Inability to pay benefits when due.
(a)
Reportable event.
A reportable event occurs when a plan is currently unable or projected to be unable to pay benefits.
(1)
Current inability.
A plan is currently unable to pay benefits if it fails to provide any participant or beneficiary the full benefits to which the person is entitled under the terms of the plan, at the time the benefit is due and in the form in which it is due. A plan is not treated as being currently unable to pay benefits if its failure to pay is caused solely by—
(i) A limitation under section 436 of the Code and section 206(g) of ERISA (dealing with funding-based limits on benefits and benefit accruals under single-employer plans),
(ii) The need to verify a person's eligibility for benefits,
(iii) The inability to locate a person, or
(iv) Any other administrative delay, to the extent that the delay is for less than the shorter of two months or two full benefit payment periods.
(2)
Projected inability.
A plan is projected to be unable to pay benefits when, as of the last day of any quarter of a plan year, the plan's “liquid assets” are less than two times the amount of the “disbursements from the plan” for such quarter. “Liquid assets” and “disbursements from the plan” have the same meaning as under section 303(j)(4)(E) of ERISA and section 430(j)(4)(E) of the Code.
(b)
Waiver—plans subject to liquidity shortfall rules.
Notice under this section is waived unless the reportable event occurs during a plan year for which the plan is exempt from the liquidity shortfall rules in section 303(j)(4) of ERISA and section 430(j)(4) of the Code because it is described in section 303(g)(2)(B) of ERISA and section 430(g)(2)(B) of the Code.

§ 4043.27
Distribution to a substantial owner.
(a)
Reportable event.
A reportable event occurs for a plan when—
(1) There is a distribution to a substantial owner of a contributing sponsor of the plan;
(2) The total of all distributions made to the substantial owner within the one-year period ending with the date of such distribution exceeds $10,000;
(3) The distribution is not made by reason of the substantial owner's death;
(4) Immediately after the distribution, the plan has nonforfeitable benefits (as provided in § 4022.5 of this chapter) that are not funded; and
(5) Either—
(i) The sum of the values of all distributions to any one substantial owner within the one-year period ending with the date of the distribution is more than one percent of the end-of-year total amount of the plan's assets (as required to be reported on Schedule H or Schedule I to Form 5500) for each of the two plan years immediately preceding the event year, or
(ii) The sum of the values of all distributions to all substantial owners within the one-year period ending with the date of the distribution is more than five percent of the end-of-year total amount of the plan's assets (as required to be reported on Schedule H or Schedule I to Form 5500) for each of the two plan years immediately preceding the event year.
(b)
Determination rules
—(1)
Valuation of distribution.
The value of a distribution under this section is the sum of—
(i) The cash amounts actually received by the substantial owner;
(ii) The purchase price of any irrevocable commitment; and
(iii) The fair market value of any other assets distributed, determined as of the date of distribution to the substantial owner.
(2)
Date of substantial owner distribution.
The date of distribution to a substantial owner of a cash distribution is the date it is received by the substantial owner. The date of distribution to a substantial owner of an irrevocable commitment is the date on which the obligation to provide benefits passes from the plan to the insurer. The date of any other distribution to a substantial owner is the date when the plan relinquishes control over the assets transferred directly or indirectly to the substantial owner.
(3)
Determination date.
The determination of whether a participant is (or has been in the preceding 60 months) a substantial owner is made on the date when there has been a distribution that would be reportable under this section if made to a substantial owner.
(c)
Alternative method of compliance—annuity.
In the case of an annuity for a substantial owner, a filing that satisfies the requirements of this section with respect to any payment under the annuity and that discloses the period, the amount of the payment, and the duration of the annuity satisfies the requirements of this section with respect to all subsequent payments under the annuity.
(d)
Waivers
—(1)
Low-default-risk.
Notice under this section is waived if each contributing sponsor of the plan and the highest level U.S. parent of each contributing sponsor are low-default-risk on the date of the event.
(2)
Well-funded plan.
Notice under this section is waived if the plan is in the well-funded plan safe harbor for the event year.
(3)
Public company.
Notice under this section is waived if any contributing sponsor of the plan before the transaction, or the parent company within a parent-subsidiary controlled group of any such contributing sponsor, is a public company and timely files a SEC Form 8-K disclosing the event under an item of the Form 8-K other than under Item 2.02 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) or in financial statements under Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits).

A reportable event occurs when a plan merges, consolidates, or transfers its assets or liabilities under section 208 of ERISA or section 414(
l
) of the Code.
(b)
Waiver.
Notice under this section is waived for this event. However, notice may be required under § 4043.29 (for a controlled group change) or § 4043.32 (for a transfer of benefit liabilities).
§ 4043.29
Change in controlled group.
(a)
Reportable event.
(1) A reportable event occurs for a plan when there is a transaction that results, or will result, in one or more persons' (including any person who is or was a contributing sponsor) ceasing to be a member of the
plan's controlled group (other than by merger involving members of the same controlled group).
(2) For purposes of this section, the term “transaction” includes, but is not limited to, a legally binding agreement, whether or not written, to transfer ownership, an actual transfer of ownership, and an actual change in ownership that occurs as a matter of law or through the exercise or lapse of pre-existing rights. Whether an agreement is legally binding is to be determined without regard to any conditions in the agreement. A transaction is not reportable if it will result solely in a reorganization involving a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization, however effected.
(b)
Waivers.
(1) De minimis
10-percent segment.
Notice under this section is waived if the person or persons that will cease to be members of the plan's controlled group represent a
de minimis
10-percent segment of the plan's old controlled group for the most recent fiscal year(s) ending on or before the date the reportable event occurs.
(2)
Foreign entity.
Notice under this section is waived if each person that will cease to be a member of the plan's controlled group is a foreign entity other than a foreign parent.
(3)
Small plan.
Notice under this section is waived if the plan had 100 or fewer participants for whom flat-rate premiums were payable for the plan year preceding the event year.
(4)
Low-default-risk.
Notice under this section is waived if each post-event contributing sponsor of the plan and the highest level U.S. parent of each post-event contributing sponsor are low-default-risk on the date of the event.
(5)
Well-funded plan.
Notice under this section is waived if the plan is in the well-funded plan safe harbor for the event year.
(6)
Public company.
Notice under this section is waived if any contributing sponsor of the plan before the transaction, or the parent company within a parent-subsidiary controlled group of any such contributing sponsor, is a public company and timely files a SEC Form 8-K disclosing the event under an item of the Form 8-K other than under Item 2.02 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) or in financial statements under Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits).
(c)
Examples.
The following examples assume that no waiver applies.
(1)
Controlled group breakup.
Company A (the contributing sponsor of Plan A), and Company B (the contributing sponsor of Plan B) are in the same controlled group with Parent Company AB. On March 31, Parent Company AB and Company C enter into an agreement to sell the stock of Company B to Company C, a company outside of the controlled group. The transaction will close on August 31 and Company B will continue to maintain Plan B. Both Company A (Plan A's contributing sponsor) and the plan administrator of Plan A are required to report that Company B will leave Plan A's controlled group. Company B (Plan B's contributing sponsor) and the plan administrator of Plan B are required to report that Company A and Parent Company AB are no longer part of Plan B's controlled group. Both reports are due on April 30, 30 days after they entered into the agreement to sell Company B.
(2)
Change in contributing sponsor.
Plan Q is maintained by Company Q. Company Q enters into a binding contract to sell a portion of its assets and to transfer employees participating in Plan Q, along with Plan Q, to Company R, which is not a member of Company Q's controlled group. There will be no change in the structure of Company Q's controlled group. On the effective date of the sale, Company R will become the contributing sponsor of Plan Q. A reportable event occurs on the date of the transaction (
i.e.,
the date the binding contract was executed), because as a result of the transaction, Company Q (and any other member of its controlled group) will cease to be a member of Plan Q's controlled group. If on the notice due date the change in the contributing sponsor has not yet become effective, Company Q has the reporting obligation. If the change in the contributing sponsor has become effective by the notice due date, Company R has the reporting obligation.
(3)
Dissolution of controlled group member.
Company A (which maintains Plan
A) and Company B are in the same controlled group with Parent Company AB. Pursuant to an asset sale agreement, Company B sells its assets to a company outside of the controlled group. After the sale, Company B will be dissolved and no longer operating. Since Company B will no longer be a member of Plan A's controlled group, a reportable event occurs on the date Company B enters into the asset sale agreement. Note that this event may also be required to be reported as a liquidation event under 29 CFR 4043.30.
(4)
Merger of controlled group members.
Company A (which maintains Plan A) and Company B are in the same controlled group with Parent Company AB. Parent Company AB decides to merge the operations of Company B into Company A. Although Company B will no longer be a member of Plan A's controlled group, no report is due given Company B is merging with Company A.
[80 FR 55002, Sept. 11, 2015, as amended at 85 FR 6062, Feb. 4, 2020]
§ 4043.30
Liquidation.
(a)
Reportable event.
A reportable event occurs for a plan when a member of the plan's controlled group—
(1) Resolves to cease all revenue-generating business operations, sell substantially all its assets, or otherwise effect or implement its complete liquidation (including liquidation into another controlled group member) by decision of the member's board of directors (or equivalent body such as the managing partners or owners) or other actor with the power to authorize such cessation of operations, sale, or a liquidation, unless the event would be reported under paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section;
(2) Institutes or has instituted against it a proceeding to be dissolved or is dissolved, whichever occurs first; or
(3) Liquidates in a case under the Bankruptcy Code, or under any similar law.
(b)
Waivers
—(1)
De minimis 10-percent segment.
Notice under this section is waived if the person or persons that liquidate under paragraph (a) of this section do not include any contributing sponsor of the plan and represent a de minimis 10-percent segment of the plan's controlled group for the most recent fiscal year(s) ending on or before the date the reportable event occurs.
(2)
Foreign entity.
Notice under this section is waived if each person that liquidates under paragraph (a) of this section is a foreign entity other than a foreign parent.
(3)
Reporting under insolvency event.
Notice under this section is waived if reporting is also required under § 4043.35(a)(3) or (4) and notice has been provided timely to PBGC for the same event under that section.
(c)
Public company extension.
If any contributing sponsor of the plan, or the parent company within a parent-subsidiary controlled group of such contributing sponsor, is a public company, the due date for notice under this section is extended until the earlier of—
(1) The date the contributing sponsor or parent company timely files a SEC Form 8-K disclosing the event under an item of the Form 8-K other than under Item 2.02 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) or in financial statements under Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits); or
(2) The date when a press release with respect to the liquidation described under paragraph (a) of this section is issued in the U.S. in the English language.
(d)
Examples
—(1)
Liquidation within a controlled group.
Plan A's controlled group consists of Company A (its contributing sponsor), Company B, Company Q (the parent of Company A and Company B). Company B represents the most significant portion of cash flow for the controlled group. Company B experiences an unforeseen event that negatively impacts operations and results in an increase in debt. The controlled group liquidates Company B by ceasing all operations, settling its debts, and merging any remaining assets into Company Q. (For purposes of this example, it does not matter under which of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section reporting is triggered). The transaction is to be treated as a tax-free liquidation for tax purposes. Both Company A (Plan A's contributing sponsor) and the plan administrator of Plan A are required to report
that Company B will liquidate within the controlled group.
(2)
Cessation of operations.
Plan A is sponsored by Company A. The owners of Company A decide to cease all revenue-generating operations. Certain administrative employees will wind down the business and continue to be employed until the wind down is complete, which could take several months. Company A is required to report a liquidation reportable event 30 days after the decision is made to cease all revenue-generating operations.
(3)
Sale of assets.
Plan A is sponsored by Company A. In a meeting of the Board of Directors of Company A, the Board resolves to sell all the assets of Company A to Company B. Under the asset sale agreement with Company B, Company B will not assume Plan A; Company A expects to undertake a standard termination of Plan A. Company A is required to report a liquidation event 30 days after the Board resolved to sell the assets of Company A.
[85 FR 6063, Feb. 4, 2020]
§ 4043.31
Extraordinary dividend or stock redemption.
(a)
Reportable event.
A reportable event occurs for a plan when any member of the plan's controlled group declares a dividend or redeems its own stock and the amount or net value of the distribution, when combined with other such distributions during the same fiscal year of the person, exceeds the person's net income before after-tax gain or loss on any sale of assets, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, for the prior fiscal year. A distribution by a person to a member of its controlled group is disregarded.
(b)
Determination rules.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the net value of a non-cash distribution is the fair market value of assets transferred by the person making the distribution, reduced by the fair market value of any liabilities assumed or consideration given by the recipient in connection with the distribution. Net value determinations should be based on readily available fair market value(s) or independent appraisal(s) performed within one year before the distribution is made. To the extent that fair market values are not readily available and no such appraisals exist, the fair market value of an asset transferred in connection with a distribution or a liability assumed by a recipient of a distribution is deemed to be equal to 200 percent of the book value of the asset or liability on the books of the person making the distribution. Stock redeemed is deemed to have no value.
(c)
Waivers
—(1)
De minimis 10-percent segment.

de minimis
10-percent segment of the plan's controlled group for the most recent fiscal year(s) ending on or before the date the reportable event occurs.

(6)
Public company.
Notice under this section is waived if any contributing sponsor of the plan before the transaction, or the parent company within a parent-subsidiary controlled group of any such contributing sponsor, is a public company and timely files a SEC Form 8-K disclosing the event under an item of the Form 8-K other than under Item 2.02 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition) or in financial statements under Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits).

l
) of the Code.

l
) of the Code, the date determined in accordance with 26 CFR 1.414(

)-1(b)(11) will be considered the date of transfer.
(2)

For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the payment of a lump sum, or purchase of an irrevocable commitment to provide an annuity, in satisfaction of benefit liabilities is not a transfer of benefit liabilities.
(c)

# Note:
Certain provisions of part 4044 have been superseded by legislative changes. For example, there are references to provisions formerly codified in 29 CFR part 2617, subpart C (and to the Notice of Sufficiency provided for thereunder) that no longer exist because of changes in the PBGC's plan termination regulations in response to the Single-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1986 and the Pension Protection Act of 1987. The PBGC intends to amend part 4044 at a later date to conform it to current statutory provisions.

# Subpart A—Allocation of Assets

# General Provisions
§ 4044.1
Purpose and scope.
This part implements section 4044 of ERISA, which contains rules for allocating a plan's assets when the plan terminates. These rules have been in effect since September 2, 1974, the date of enactment of ERISA. This part applies to any single-employer plan covered by title IV of ERISA that submits a notice of intent to terminate, or for which PBGC commences an action to terminate the plan under section 4042 of ERISA.
(a)
Subpart A.
Sections 4044.1 through 4044.4 set forth general rules for applying §§ 4044.10 through 4044.17. Sections 4044.10 through 4044.17 interpret the rules and describe procedures for allocating plan assets to priority categories 1 through 6.
(b)
Subpart B.
The purpose of subpart B is to establish the method of determining the value of benefits and assets under terminating single-employer pension plans covered by title IV of ERISA. This valuation is needed for both plans trusteed under title IV and plans which are not trusteed. For the former, the valuation is needed to allocate plan assets in accordance with subpart A of this part and to determine the amount of any plan asset insufficiency. For the latter, the valuation is needed to allocate assets in accordance with subpart A and to distribute the assets in accordance with subpart B of part 4041 of this chapter.
(1) Section 4044.41 sets forth the general provisions of subpart B and applies to all terminating single-employer plans. Sections 4044.51 through 4044.58 prescribe the benefit valuation rules for plans that are placed into trusteeship by PBGC, including (in §§ 4044.55 through 4044.58) the rules and procedures a plan administrator shall follow to determine the expected retirement age (XRA) for a plan participant entitled to early retirement benefits for whom the annuity starting date is not known as of the valuation date. This applies to all trusteed plans which have such early retirement benefits. The plan administrator shall determine an XRA under § 4044.55, § 4044.56 or § 4044.57, as appropriate, for each active participant or participant with a deferred vested benefit who is entitled to an early retirement benefit and who as of the valuation date has not selected an annuity starting date.
(2) Sections 4044.71 through 4044.75 prescribe the benefit valuation rules for calculating the value of a benefit to be paid a participant or beneficiary under a terminating pension plan that is distributing assets where the plan has not been placed into trusteeship by PBGC.
[61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 34605, June 14, 2011; 89 FR 48300, June 6, 2024]
§ 4044.2
Definitions.
(a) The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: annuity, bankruptcy filing date, basic-type benefit, Code, distribution date, earliest retirement age at valuation date, ERISA, expected retirement age (XRA), fair market value, guaranteed benefit, insurer, IRS, irrevocable commitment, majority owner, mandatory employee contributions, nonbasic-type benefit, nonforfeitable benefit, non-PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, normal retirement age, notice of intent to terminate, PBGC, person, plan, plan administrator, single-employer plan, termination date, unreduced retirement age (URA), and voluntary employee contributions.
(b) For purposes of this part:
Deferred annuity
means an annuity under which the specified date or age at which payments are to begin occurs after the valuation date.
Early retirement benefit
means an annuity benefit payable under the terms of the plan, under which the participant is entitled to begin receiving payments before his or her normal retirement age and which is not payable on account of the disability of the participant. It may be reduced according to the terms of the plan.

means a single-employer plan which is able to close out by purchasing annuities in the private sector
Priority category
means one of the categories contained in sections 4044
(a)(1) through (a)(6) of ERISA that establish the order in which plan assets are to be allocated.
Trusteed plan
means a single-employer plan which has been placed into trusteeship by PBGC.
Valuation date
means (1) for non-trusteed plans, the date of distribution and (2) for trusteed plans, the termination date.
(c) For purposes of subpart B of this part (unless otherwise required by the context):
Age
means the participant's age at his or her nearest birthday and is determined by rounding the individual's exact age to the nearest whole year. Half years are rounded to the next highest year. This is also known as the “insurance age.”
(d) For purposes of §§ 4044.55 through 4044.58:
Monthly benefit
means the guaranteed benefit payable by PBGC.
(e) For purposes of §§ 4044.71 through 4044.75:
Lump sum payable in lieu of an annuity
means a benefit that is payable in a single installment and is derived from an annuity payable under the plan.
Other lump sum benefit
means a benefit in priority category 5 or 6, determined under subpart A of this part, that is payable in a single installment (or substantially so) under the terms of the plan, and that is not derived from an annuity payable under the plan. The benefit may be a severance pay benefit, a death benefit or other single installment benefit.
[61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 16959, Apr. 8, 2002; 74 FR 11035, Mar. 16, 2009; 76 FR 34605, June 14, 2011; 83 FR 49806, Oct. 3, 2018; 89 FR 48300, June 6, 2024]
§ 4044.3
General rule.
(a)
Asset allocation.
Upon the termination of a single-employer plan, the plan administrator shall allocate the plan assets available to pay for benefits under the plan in the manner prescribed by this subpart. Plan assets available to pay for benefits include all plan assets (valued according to § 4044.41(b)) remaining after the subtraction of all liabilities, other than liabilities for future benefit payments, paid or payable from plan assets under the provisions of the plan. Liabilities include expenses, fees and other administrative costs, and benefit payments due before the allocation date. Except as provided in § 4044.4(b), an irrevocable commitment by an insurer to pay a benefit, which commitment is in effect on the date of the asset allocation, is not considered a plan asset, and a benefit payable under such a commitment is excluded from the allocation process.
(b)
Allocation date.
For plans that close out under § 4041.28 or § 4041.50, assets shall be allocated as of the date plan assets are to be distributed. For other plans, assets shall be allocated as of the termination date.
[61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 34605, June 14, 2011]
§ 4044.4
Violations.
(a)
General.
A plan administrator violates ERISA if plan assets are allocated or distributed upon plan termination in a manner other than that prescribed in section 4044 of ERISA and this subpart, except as may be required to prevent disqualification of the plan under the Code and regulations thereunder.
(b)
Distributions in anticipation of termination.
A distribution, transfer, or allocation of assets to a participant or to an insurance company for the benefit of a participant, made in anticipation of plan termination, is considered to be an allocation of plan assets upon termination, and is covered by paragraph (a) of this section. In determining whether a distribution, transfer, or allocation of assets has been made in anticipation of plan termination PBGC will consider all of the facts and circumstances including—
(1) Any change in funding or operation procedures;
(2) Past practice with regard to employee requests for forms of distribution;
(3) Whether the distribution is consistent with plan provisions; and
(4) Whether an annuity contract that provides for a cutback based on the guarantee limits in subpart B of part 4022 of this chapter could have been purchased from an insurance company.

# Allocation of Assets to Benefit Categories
§ 4044.10
Manner of allocation.
(a)
General.
The plan administrator shall allocate plan assets available to pay for benefits under the plan using the rules and procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, or any other procedure that results in each participant (or beneficiary) receiving the same benefits he or she would receive if the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (f) were followed.
(b)
Assigning benefits.
The basic-type and nonbasic-type benefits payable with respect to each participant in a terminated plan shall be assigned to one or more priority categories in accordance with §§ 4044.11 through 4044.16. Benefits derived from voluntary employee contributions, which are assigned only to priority category 1, are treated, under section 204(c)(4) of ERISA and section 411(d)(5) of the Code, as benefits under a separate plan. The amount of a benefit payable with respect to each participant shall be determined as of the termination date, but, in a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, subject to the limitations in sections 4022(g) and 4044(e) of ERISA (and corresponding provisions of these regulations).
(c)
Valuing benefits.
The value of a participant's benefit or benefits assigned to each priority category shall be determined, as of the allocation date, in accordance with the provisions of subpart B of this part. The value of each participant's basic-type benefit or benefits in a priority category shall be reduced by the value of the participant's benefit of the same type that is assigned to a higher priority category. Except as provided in the next two sentences, the same procedure shall be followed for nonbasic-type benefits. The value of a participant's nonbasic-type benefits in priority categories 3, 5, and 6 shall not be reduced by the value of the participant's nonbasic-type benefit assigned to priority category 2. Benefits in priority category 1 shall neither be included in nor subtracted from lower priority categories. In no event shall a benefit assigned to a priority category be valued at less than zero.
(d)
Allocating assets to priority categories.
Plan assets available to pay for benefits under the plan shall be allocated to each priority category in succession, beginning with priority category 1. If the plan has sufficient assets to pay for all benefits in a priority category, the remaining assets shall then be allocated to the next lower priority category. This process shall be repeated until all benefits in priority categories 1 through 6 have been provided or until all available plan assets have been allocated.
(e)
Allocating assets within priority categories.
Except for priority categories 4 and 5, if the plan assets available for allocation to any priority category are insufficient to pay for all benefits in that priority category, those assets shall be distributed among the participants according to the ratio that the value of each participant's benefit or benefits in that priority category bears to the total value of all benefits in that priority category. If the plan assets available for allocation to priority category 4 are insufficient to pay for all benefits in that category, the assets shall be allocated, first, to the value of all participants' nonforfeitable benefits that would be assigned to priority category 4 other than those impacted by the majority-owner limitation under § 4022.26 of this chapter. If assets available for allocation to priority category 4 are sufficient to fully satisfy the value of those other benefits, the remaining assets shall then be allocated to the value of the benefits that would be guaranteed but for the majority-owner limitation. These remaining assets shall be distributed among the majority owners according to the ratio that the value of each majority owner's benefit that would be guaranteed but for the majority-owner limitation bears to the total value of all benefits that would be guaranteed but for the majority-owner limitation. If the plan assets available for allocation to priority category 5 are insufficient to pay for all benefits in that category, the assets shall be allocated, first, to the value of each participant's nonforfeitable benefits that would be assigned to priority category 5 under § 4044.15 after reduction for the value of benefits assigned to higher priority categories,
based only on the provisions of the plan in effect at the beginning of the five-year period immediately preceding the termination date. If assets available for allocation to priority category 5 are sufficient to fully satisfy the value of those benefits, assets shall then be allocated to the value of the benefit increase under the oldest amendment during the five-year period immediately preceding the termination date, reduced by the value of benefits assigned to higher priority categories (including higher subcategories in priority category 5). This allocation procedure shall be repeated for each succeeding plan amendment within the five-year period until all plan assets available for allocation have been exhausted. If an amendment decreased benefits, amounts previously allocated with respect to each participant in excess of the value of the reduced benefit shall be reduced accordingly. In the subcategory in which assets are exhausted, the assets shall be distributed among the participants according to the ratio that the value of each participant's benefit or benefits in that subcategory bears to the total value of all benefits in that subcategory.
(f)
Applying assets to basic-type or nonbasic-type benefits within priority categories.
The assets allocated to a participant's benefit or benefits within each priority category shall first be applied to pay for the participant's basic-type benefit or benefits assigned to that priority category. Any assets allocated on behalf of that participant remaining after satisfying the participant's basic-type benefit or benefits in that priority category shall then be applied to pay for the participant's nonbasic-type benefit or benefits assigned to that priority category. If the assets allocable to a participant's basic-type benefit or benefits in all priority categories are insufficient to pay for all of the participant's guaranteed benefits, the assets allocated to that participant's benefit in priority category 4 shall be applied, first, to the guaranteed portion of the participant's benefit in priority category 4. The remaining assets allocated to that participant's benefit in priority category 4, if any, shall be applied to the nonguaranteed portion of the participant's benefit.
(g)
Allocation to established subclasses.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, the assets of a plan that has established subclasses within any priority category may be allocated to the plan's subclasses in accordance with the rules set forth in § 4044.17.
[61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 34605, June 14, 2011; 83 FR 49806, Oct. 3, 2018]
§ 4044.11
Priority category 1 benefits.
(a)
Definition.
The benefits in priority category 1 are participants' accrued benefits derived from voluntary employee contributions.
(b)
Assigning benefits.
Absent an election described in the next sentence, the benefit assigned to priority category 1 with respect to each participant is the balance of the separate account maintained for the participant's voluntary contributions. If a participant has elected to receive an annuity in lieu of his or her account balance, the benefit assigned to priority category 1 with respect to that participant is the present value of that annuity.
§ 4044.12
Priority category 2 benefits.
(a)
Definition.
The benefits in priority category 2 are participants' accrued benefits derived from mandatory employee contributions, whether to be paid as an annuity benefit with a pre-retirement death benefit that returns mandatory employee contributions or, if a participant so elects under the terms of the plan and subpart A of part 4022 of this chapter, as a lump sum benefit. Benefits are primarily basic-type benefits although nonbasic-type benefits may also be included as follows:
(1)
Basic-type benefits.
The basic-type benefit in priority category 2 with respect to each participant is the sum of the values of the annuity benefit and the pre-retirement death benefit determined under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(2)
Nonbasic-type benefits.
If a participant elects to receive a lump sum benefit and if the value of the lump sum benefit exceeds the value of the basic-
type benefit in priority category 2 determined with respect to the participant, the excess is a nonbasic-type benefit. There is no nonbasic-type benefit in priority category 2 for a participant who does not elect to receive a lump sum benefit.
(b)
Conversion of mandatory employee contributions to an annuity benefit.
Subject to the limitation set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a participant's accumulated mandatory employee contributions shall be converted to an annuity form of benefit payable at the normal retirement age or, if the plan provides for early retirement, at the expected retirement age. The conversion shall be made using the interest rates and factors specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The form of the annuity benefit (e.g., straight life annuity, joint and survivor annuity, cash refund annuity, etc.) is the form that the participant or beneficiary is entitled to on the termination date. If the participant does not have a nonforfeitable right to a benefit, other than the return of his or her mandatory contributions in a lump sum, the annuity form of benefit is the form the participant would be entitled to if the participant had a nonforfeitable right to an annuity benefit under the plan on the termination date.
(1)
Accumulated mandatory employee contributions.
Subject to any addition for the cost of ancillary benefits plus interest, as provided in the following sentence, the amount of the accumulated mandatory employee contributions for each participant is the participant's total nonforfeitable mandatory employee contributions remaining in the plan on the termination date plus interest, if any, under the plan provisions. Mandatory employee contributions, if any, used after the effective date of the minimum vesting standards in section 203 of ERISA and section 411 of the Code for costs or to provide ancillary benefits such as life insurance or health insurance, plus interest under the plan provisions, shall be added to the contributions that remain in the plan to determine the accumulated mandatory employee contributions.
(2)
Interest rates and conversion factors.
The interest rates and conversion factors used in the administration of the plan shall be used to convert a participant's accumulated mandatory contributions to the annuity form of benefit. In the absence of plan rules and factors, the interest rates and conversion factors established by the IRS for allocation of accrued benefits between employer and employee contributions under the provisions of section 204(c) of ERISA and section 411(c) of the Code shall be used.
(3)
Minimum accrued benefit.
The annuity benefit derived from mandatory employee contributions may not be less than the minimum accrued benefit under the provisions of section 204(c) of ERISA and section 411(c) of the Code.
(4)
Rollover amounts.
In the case of a benefit resulting from rollover amounts, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the interest rates and conversion factors in paragraph (c)(4) of this section are used to determine the portion of the accrued benefit derived from the employee's contributions and, if any, the portion of the accrued benefit derived from employer contributions.
(c)
Assigning benefits.
If a participant or beneficiary elects to receive a lump sum benefit, his or her benefit shall be determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Otherwise, the benefits with respect to a participant shall be determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(1)
Annuity benefit and pre-retirement death benefit.
The annuity benefit and the pre-retirement death benefit assigned to priority category 2 with respect to a participant are determined as follows:
(i) The annuity benefit is the benefit computed under paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) Except for adjustments necessary to meet the minimum lump sum requirements as hereafter provided, the pre-retirement death benefit is the benefit under the plan that returns all or a portion of the participant's mandatory employee contributions upon the death of the participant before retirement. A benefit that became payable in a single installment (or substantially so) because the participant died before the termination date is a liability of the plan within the meaning
of § 4044.3(a) and should not be assigned to priority category 2. A benefit payable upon a participant's death that is included in the annuity form of the benefit derived from mandatory employee contributions (e.g., the survivor's portion of a joint and survivor annuity or the cash refund portion of a cash refund annuity) is assigned to priority category 2 as part of the annuity benefit under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and is not assigned as a death benefit. The pre-retirement death benefit may not be less than the minimum lump sum required upon withdrawal of mandatory employee contributions by the IRS under section 204(c) of ERISA and section 411(c) of the Code.
(2)
Lump sum benefit.
Except for adjustments necessary to meet the minimum lump sum requirements as hereafter provided, if a participant elects to receive a lump sum benefit under the provisions of the plan, the amount of the benefit that is assigned to priority category 2 with respect to the participant is—
(i) The combined value of the annuity benefit and the pre-retirement death benefit determined according to paragraph (c)(1) (which constitutes the basic-type benefit) plus
(ii) The amount, if any, of the participant's accumulated mandatory employee contributions that exceeds the combined value of the annuity benefit and the pre-retirement death benefit (which constitutes the nonbasic-type benefit), but not more than
(iii) The amount of the participant's accumulated mandatory contributions.
(3) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, accumulated mandatory contributions means the contributions with interest, if any, payable under plan provisions to the participant or beneficiary on termination of the plan or, in the absence of such provisions, the amount that is payable if the participant withdrew his or her contributions on the termination date. The lump sum benefit may not be less than the minimum lump required by the IRS under section 204(c) of ERISA and section 411(c) of the Code upon withdrawal of mandatory employee contributions.
(4)
Special rules for benefit resulting from rollover amounts
—(i)
Mandatory employee contributions.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, in the case of a benefit resulting from rollover amounts, the accrued benefit derived from mandatory employee contributions is determined using the interest rates and conversion factors under section 411(c)(2)(B) and (C) of the Code for purposes of computing an employee's accrued benefit derived from the employee's contributions. The annuity benefit and the pre-retirement death benefit, as determined on this basis, is the benefit resulting from rollover amounts in priority category 2.
(ii)
Employer contributions.
Any portion of a participant's accrued benefit resulting from rollover amounts that is in excess of the accrued benefit derived from mandatory employee contributions determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section (
i.e.,
the accrued benefit derived from employer contributions) is a guaranteeable benefit in priority category 3, priority category 4, or priority category 5, as applicable under this part.
[61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 79 FR 70095, Nov. 25, 2014]
§ 4044.13
Priority category 3 benefits.
(a)
Definition.
The benefits in priority category 3 are those annuity benefits that were in pay status before the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date, and those annuity benefits that could have been in pay status (then or as of the next payment date under the plan's rules for starting benefit payments) for participants who, before the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date, had reached their Earliest PBGC Retirement Date (as determined under § 4022.10 of this chapter) based on plan provisions in effect on the day before the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date. For example, in a plan with a termination date of September 1, 2012, the benefits in priority category 3 are those annuity benefits that were in pay status on or before September 1, 2009, and those annuity benefits that could have been in pay status for participants who, on or before September 1, 2009, had reached their Earliest PBGC Retirement Date based on plan provisions in
effect on September 1, 2009. Benefit increases, as defined in § 4022.2, that were in effect throughout the 5-year period ending on the termination date, including automatic benefit increases during that period to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, shall be included in determining the priority category 3 benefit. For example, in a plan with a termination date of September 1, 2012, a benefit increase that was in effect throughout the 5-year period from September 2, 2007, to September 1, 2012, is included in priority category 3. Benefits are primarily basic-type benefits, although nonbasic-type benefits will be included if any portion of a participant's priority category 3 benefit is not guaranteeable under the provisions of subpart A of part 4022 and § 4022.21 of this chapter.
(b)
Assigning benefits.
The annuity benefit that is assigned to priority category 3 with respect to each participant is the lowest annuity that was paid or payable under the rules in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(6) of this section.
(1)
Eligibility of participants and beneficiaries.
A participant or beneficiary is eligible for a priority category 3 benefit if either of the following applies:
(i) The participant's (or beneficiary's) benefit was in pay status before the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date.
(ii) Before the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date, the participant was eligible for an annuity benefit that could have been in pay status and had reached his or her Earliest PBGC Retirement Date (as determined in § 4022.10 of this chapter, based on plan provisions in effect on the day before the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date). Whether a participant was eligible to receive an annuity before the beginning of the 3-year period shall be determined using the plan provisions in effect on the day before the beginning of the 3-year period.
(iii) If a participant described in either of the preceding two paragraphs died during the 3-year period ending on the date of the plan termination and his or her beneficiary is entitled to an annuity, the beneficiary is eligible for a priority category 3 benefit.
(2)
Plan provisions governing determination of benefit.
In determining the amount of the priority category 3 annuity with respect to a participant, the plan administrator shall use the participant's age, service, actual or expected retirement age, and other relevant facts as of the following dates:
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3), for a participant or beneficiary whose benefit was in pay status before the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date, the priority category 3 benefit shall be determined according to plan provisions in effect on the date the benefit commenced. The form of annuity elected by a retiree is considered the normal form of annuity for that participant.
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3), for a participant who was eligible to receive an annuity before the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date but whose benefit was not in pay status, the priority category 3 benefit and the normal form of annuity shall be determined according to plan provisions in effect on the day before the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date as if the benefit had commenced at that time.
(3)
General benefit limitations.
The general benefit limitation is determined as follows:
(i) If a participant's benefit was in pay status before the beginning of the 3-year period, the benefit assigned to priority category 3 with respect to that participant is limited to the lesser of the lowest annuity benefit in pay status during the 3-year period ending on the termination date and the lowest annuity benefit payable under the plan provisions at any time during the 5-year period ending on the termination date.
(ii) Unless a benefit was in pay status before the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date, the benefit assigned to priority category 3 with respect to a participant is limited to the lowest annuity benefit payable under the plan provisions, including any reduction for early retirement, at any time during the 5-year period ending on the termination date. If
the annuity form of benefit under a formula that appears to produce the lowest benefit differs from the normal annuity form for the participant under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the benefits shall be compared after the differing form is converted to the normal annuity form, using plan factors. In the absence of plan factors, the factors in subpart B of part 4022 of this chapter shall be used.
(iii) For purposes of this paragraph, if a terminating plan has been in effect less than five years on the termination date, computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) of this section, the lowest annuity benefit under the plan during the 5-year period ending on the termination date is zero. If the plan is a successor to a previously established defined benefit plan within the meaning of section 4021(a) of ERISA, the time it has been in effect will include the time the predecessor plan was in effect.
(4)
Determination of beneficiary's benefit.
If a beneficiary is eligible for a priority category 3 benefit because of the death of a participant during the 3-year period ending on the termination date, the benefit assigned to priority category 3 for the beneficiary shall be determined as if the participant had died the day before the 3-year period began.
(5)
Automatic benefit increases.
If plan provisions adopted and effective on or before the first day of the 5-year period ending on the termination date provided for automatic increases in the benefit formula for both active participants and those in pay status or for participants in pay status only, the lowest annuity benefit payable during the 5-year period ending on the termination date determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section includes the automatic increases scheduled during the fourth and fifth years preceding termination, subject to the restriction that benefit increases for active participants in excess of the increases for retirees shall not be taken into account.
(6)
Computation of time periods.
For purposes of this section, a plan or amendment is “in effect” on the later of the date on which it is adopted or the date it becomes effective.
(c)
PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination.
In a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination:
(1) For purposes of this paragraph (c), “applicable pre-termination period” means the period—
(i) Beginning on the first day of the 5-year period ending on the bankruptcy filing date; and
(ii) Ending on the termination date. For example, if the bankruptcy filing date is January 15, 2008, and the termination date is March 22, 2009, the applicable pre-termination period is the period beginning on January 16, 2003, and ending on March 22, 2009.
(2) “Applicable pre-termination period” is substituted for “5-year period ending on the termination date” each place that “5-year period ending on the termination date” appears in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, “bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination date” and “date of the plan termination” each place that “termination date” and “date of the plan termination” appear in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. In paragraph (b)(5) of this section, “the bankruptcy filing date” is substituted for “termination” in the phrase “during the fourth and fifth years preceding termination.”
(4) Example: A plan provides for normal retirement at age 65 and has only one early retirement benefit: a subsidized early retirement benefit for participants who terminate employment on or after age 60 with 20 years of service. These plan provisions have been unchanged since 1990. The contributing sponsor of the plan files a bankruptcy petition in June 2008, and the plan terminates during the bankruptcy with a termination date in September 2010. A participant retired in July 2007, at which time he was age 60 and had 20 years of service, and began receiving the subsidized early retirement benefit. The participant has no benefit in priority category 3, because he was not eligible to retire three or more years before the June 2008 bankruptcy filing date.

§ 4044.14
Priority category 4 benefits.
The benefits assigned to priority category 4 with respect to each participant are the participant's guaranteed benefits, except as provided in the next sentence. The benefit assigned to priority category 4 with respect to a participant is not limited by the aggregate benefits limitations set forth in § 4022B.1 of this chapter for individuals who are participants in more than one plan or by the guarantee limitation applicable to majority owners set forth in § 4022.26.
[61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 34606, June 14, 2011; 83 FR 49806, Oct. 3, 2018]
§ 4044.15
Priority category 5 benefits.
The benefits assigned to priority category 5 with respect to each participant are all of the participant's nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.
§ 4044.16
Priority category 6 benefits.
The benefits assigned to priority category 6 with respect to each participant are all of the participant's benefits under the plan, whether forfeitable or nonforfeitable.
§ 4044.17
Subclasses.
(a)
General rule.
A plan may establish one or more subclasses within any priority category, other than priority categories 1 and 2, which subclasses will govern the allocation of assets within that priority category. The subclasses may be based only on a participant's longer service, older age, or disability, or any combination thereof.
(b)
Limitation.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, whenever the allocation within a priority category on the basis of the subclasses established by the plan increases or decreases the cumulative amount of assets that otherwise would be allocated to guaranteed benefits, the assets so shifted shall be reallocated to other participants' benefits within the priority category in accordance with the subclasses.
(c)
Exception for subclasses in effect on September 2, 1974.
A plan administrator may allocate assets to subclasses within any priority category, other than priority categories 1 and 2, without regard to the limitation in paragraph (b) of this section if, on September 2, 1974, the plan provided for allocation of plan assets upon termination of the plan based on a participant's longer service, older age, or disability, or any combination thereof, and—
(1) Such provisions are still in effect; or
(2) The plan, if subsequently amended to modify or remove those subclasses, is re-amended to re-establish the same subclasses on or before July 28, 1981.
(d)
Discrimination under Code.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, allocation of assets to subclasses established under this section is permitted only to the extent that the allocation does not result in discrimination prohibited under the Code and regulations thereunder.

# Trusteed Plans
§ 4044.51
Benefits to be valued.
(a)
Form of benefit.
The plan administrator shall determine the form of each benefit to be valued in accordance with the following rules:
(1) If a benefit is in pay status as of the valuation date, the plan administrator shall value the form of the benefit being paid.
(2) If a benefit is not in pay status as of the valuation date but a valid election with respect to the form of benefit has been made on or before the valuation date, the plan administrator shall value the form of benefit so elected.
(3) If a benefit is not in pay status as of the valuation date and no valid election with respect to the form of benefit has been made on or before the valuation date, the plan administrator shall value the form of benefit that, under the terms of the plan, is payable in the absence of a valid election.
(b)
Timing of benefit.
The plan administrator shall value benefits whose starting date is subject to election using the assumption specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.
(1)
Where election made.
If a valid election of the starting date of a benefit has been made on or before the valuation date, the plan administrator shall assume that the starting date of the benefit is the starting date so elected.
(2)
Where no election made.
If no valid election of the starting date of a benefit has been made on or before the valuation date, the plan administrator shall assume that the starting date of the benefit is the later of—
(i) The expected retirement age, as determined under §§ 4044.55 through 4044.58, of the participant with respect to whom the benefit is payable, or
(ii) The valuation date.
[61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 89 FR 48300, June 6, 2024]
§ 4044.52
Valuation of benefits.
The plan administrator shall value all benefits as of the valuation date by—
(a) Using the mortality assumptions prescribed by § 4044.53 and the interest assumptions prescribed by § 4044.54;
(b) Using interpolation methods, where necessary, at least as accurate as linear interpolation;
(c) Using valuation formulas that accord with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices; and
(d) Adding an expense loading charge determined in accordance with this paragraph (d) to the total value of benefits.
(1)
Expense loading charge.
The expense loading charge equals the applicable inflation multiplier determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section multiplied by the sum of—
(i) Four hundred dollars ($400) multiplied by the lesser of the applicable participant count and 100, and
(ii) Two hundred-fifty dollars ($250) multiplied by the excess, if any, of the applicable participant count over 100.
(2)
Applicable inflation multiplier.
Except as provided in the next sentence, the applicable inflation multiplier equals the value of the CPI-U for September of the year preceding the year containing the valuation date divided by 296.808 (the value of the CPI-U for September of 2022), but not less than 1. However, for a valuation date on any day in January except the 31st, the applicable inflation multiplier is determined as if the valuation date were December 31 of the year preceding the year containing the valuation date. The term “CPI-U” means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, not seasonally adjusted as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.
(3)
Rounding.
Any expense loading charge determined in accordance with this paragraph (d) which is not a multiple of $1.00 is rounded to the nearest dollar.
[65 FR 14753, Mar. 17, 2000, as amended at 70 FR 72207, Dec. 2, 2005; 89 FR 48300, June 6, 2024]
§ 4044.53
Mortality assumptions.
(a)
General rule.
Subject to paragraph (b) of this section (regarding certain
death benefits), the plan administrator shall use the mortality factors prescribed in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section to value benefits under § 4044.52.
(b)
Certain death benefits.
If an annuity for one person is in pay status on the valuation date, and if the payment of a death benefit after the valuation date to another person, who need not be identifiable on the valuation date, depends in whole or in part on the death of the pay status annuitant, then the plan administrator shall value the death benefit using—
(1) The mortality rates that are applicable to the annuity in pay status under this section to represent the mortality of the pay status annuitant; and
(2) The mortality rates under paragraph (c) of this section to represent the mortality of the death beneficiary.
(c)
Healthy lives
—(1)
In general.
If the individual is not disabled under paragraph (f) of this section, the plan administrator must value the benefit using generational mortality tables described in this paragraph (c).
(i)
Construction of generational mortality tables.
The generational mortality tables in this paragraph (c) are constructed from the base mortality tables described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and the mortality improvement rates described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Base mortality tables.
The base mortality tables are set forth in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The base year for those tables is 2012.
(iii)
Mortality improvement rates.
The mortality improvement rates are the Scale MP-2021 Rates described in the Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2021 Report.
(iv)
Incorporation by reference.
The Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2021 Report, October 2021 is incorporated by reference into this section with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

Application of mortality improvement rates
—(i)
In general.
Under the generational mortality tables described in this paragraph (c), the probability of an individual's death at a particular age in the future is determined as the individual's base mortality rate that applies at that age (that is, the applicable mortality rate from the tables set forth in paragraph (c)(5) of this section for that age, gender, and status as an annuitant or a non-annuitant) multiplied by the cumulative mortality improvement factor for the individual's gender and for that age for the period from 2012 through the calendar year in which the individual is projected to reach the particular age. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides an example that illustrates how the base mortality tables in paragraph (c)(5) of this section and the Scale MP-2021 mortality improvement rates are combined to determine projected mortality rates.
(ii)
Cumulative mortality improvement factor.
The cumulative mortality improvement factor for an age and gender for a period is the product of the annual mortality improvement factors for that age and gender for each year within that period.
(iii)
Annual mortality improvement factor.
The annual mortality improvement factor for an age and gender for a year is 1 minus the mortality improvement rate that applies for that age and gender for that year. If that annual mortality improvement rate is greater than 1 (corresponding to a negative mortality improvement rate), then the projected mortality rate for that age and gender for that year is greater than the projected mortality rate for
the same age and gender for the preceding year.
(3)
Example of calculation using scale MP-2021 rates
—(i)
Calculation of mortality rate.
The mortality rate that is applied to male annuitants who are age 67 in 2024 is equal to the product of the mortality rate for 2012 that applied to male annuitants who were age 67 in 2012 (0.01288) and the cumulative mortality improvement factor for age 67 males from 2012 to 2024. The cumulative mortality improvement factor for age 67 males for the period from 2012 to 2024 is 0.9867, and the mortality rate for 2024 for male annuitants who are age 67 in that year would be 0.01271, as shown in the following table.

(ii)
Probability of survival for an individual.
After the projected mortality rates are derived for each age for each year, the rates are used to calculate the present value of a benefit stream that depends on the probability of survival year-by-year. For example, using the Scale MP-2021 rates, for purposes of calculating the present value of future payments in a benefit stream payable for a male annuitant who is age 67 in 2024, the probability of survival for the annuitant is based on the mortality rate for a male annuitant who is age 67 in 2024 (0.01271), and the projected mortality rate for a male annuitant who will be age 68 in 2025 (0.01369), age 69 in 2026 (0.01478), and so on.
(4)
Use of the tables
—(i)
Separate tables for annuitants and non-annuitants.
Separate mortality tables are provided for use for annuitants and non-annuitants. The non-annuitant mortality tables are applied to determine the probability of survival for a non-annuitant for the period before the non-annuitant is projected to commence receiving benefits. The annuitant mortality tables are applied to determine the present value of benefits for each annuitant. In addition, the annuitant mortality tables are applied for each non-annuitant with respect to each assumed commencement of benefits for the period beginning with that assumed commencement. For purposes of this section, an annuitant means a plan participant who has commenced receiving benefits, and a non-annuitant means a plan participant who has not yet commenced receiving benefits (for example, an active employee or a terminated vested participant). A participant whose benefit has partially commenced is treated as an annuitant for the portion of the benefit that has commenced and treated as a non-annuitant for the balance of the benefit. In addition, for a beneficiary of a participant, the annuitant mortality tables apply for the period beginning with each assumed commencement of benefits for the participant. If the participant has died (or to the extent the participant is assumed to die before commencing benefits), the annuitant mortality tables apply with respect to the beneficiary for the period beginning with each assumed commencement of benefits for the beneficiary.
(ii)
Examples of calculation using separate non-annuitant and annuitant tables.
For a 45-year-old active participant who is projected to commence receiving an annuity at age 55, benefit liabilities are determined using the non-annuitant mortality tables for the period before the participant attains age 55 and using the annuitant mortality tables for the period ages 55 and above. Similarly, for a 45-year-old terminated vested participant who is projected to commence an annuity at age 65, benefit liabilities are determined using the non-annuitant mortality tables for the period before the participant attains age 65 and using the annuitant mortality tables for ages 65 and above.
(5)
Base mortality tables.
The following are the base mortality tables. The base year for these tables is 2012.

§ 4044.54
Interest assumptions.
(a)
General rule.
The plan administrator must use the interest rates prescribed in this section to value benefits under § 4044.52.
(b)
Interest rate.
The interest rate used to discount an expected benefit payment is the interest rate from the applicable 4044 yield curve determined under paragraph (c) of this section for the maturity point that corresponds to the period of time from the valuation date to the date the benefit is expected to be paid unless that period of time exceeds 30 years. In that case, the interest rate used is the interest rate that corresponds to the maturity point at year 30.0. To address the timing of benefit payments during a year, reasonable approximations may be used to value benefit payments that are expected to be made during a plan year.
(c)
4044 yield curve.
A 4044 yield curve consists of interest rates (as percentages) that correspond to mid-year and whole-year maturity points for 30.0 years. The applicable 4044 yield curve is the applicable blended market yield curve determined under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section adjusted in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section by the applicable spreads determined under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(d)
Blended market yield curves.
A blended market yield curve consists of interest rates (as percentages), determined as of the last day of a month, that correspond to mid-year and whole-year maturity points for 30.0 years.
(1)
Applicable blended market yield curve.
The applicable blended market yield curve is the blended market yield curve as of the valuation date if the valuation date is the last day of a month, otherwise it is the blended market yield curve as of the last day of the month before the month containing the valuation date.
(2)
Determination of blended market yield curve.
The blended market yield curve is determined by combining the Department of the Treasury's TNC Treasury Yield Curve Spot Rates, End of Month yield curve (TNC Yield Curve) with the Department of the Treasury's HQM Corporate Bond Yield Curve Spot Rates, End of Month yield curve (HQM Bond Yield Curve) in accordance with this paragraph (d)(2). To determine the blended market yield curve as of the last day of a month—
(i) Obtain the rate for each maturity point from 0.5 to 30.0 from the TNC Yield Curve for the end of the month published by the Department of the Treasury.
(ii) Obtain the rate for each maturity point from 0.5 to 30.0 from the HQM Bond Yield Curve for the end of the month published by the Department of the Treasury.
(iii) Determine the interest rate for each maturity point from 0.5 to 30.0 on the blended market yield curve by multiplying the rate determined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section by one-third, multiplying the rate determined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section at the year by two-thirds, and adding the products.
(e)
Spreads
—(1)
Applicable spreads.
The applicable spreads for a blended market yield curve are the spreads set forth in table 1 to this paragraph (e) for the calendar quarter containing the date of the blended market yield curve.
(2)
Using spreads to adjust a blended market yield curve.
The 4044 yield curve described in paragraph (c) of this section is determined by adjusting the blended market yield curve. This adjustment is made by adding the interest rate for each maturity point on the blended market yield curve to the spread corresponding to that maturity point from the applicable spreads.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate how to determine the applicable blended market yield curve and applicable spreads for a given valuation date:
(i)
Example 1—August 31, 2024, valuation date.
Because the valuation date is the last day of a month, the applicable blended market yield curve determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is the blended market yield curve as of that date. Because August 31, 2024, is in the third calendar quarter of 2024, the applicable spreads determined under paragraph (e)(1) of this section are the spreads for the third calendar quarter of 2024.
(ii)
Example 2—November 15, 2024, valuation date.
Because the valuation date is not the last day of a month, the applicable blended market yield curve determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is the blended market yield curve as of the last day of the month before the month containing the valuation date, October 31, 2024. Because October 31, 2024, is in the fourth calendar quarter of 2024, the applicable spreads determined under paragraph (e)(1) of this section are the spreads for the fourth calendar quarter of 2024.

# Expected Retirement Age
§ 4044.55
XRA when a participant must retire to receive a benefit.
(a)
Applicability.
Except as provided in § 4044.57, the plan administrator shall determine the XRA under this section when plan provisions or established plan practice require a participant to retire from his or her job to begin receiving an early retirement benefit.
(b)
Data needed.
The plan administrator shall determine for each participant who is entitled to an early retirement benefit—
(1) The amount of the participant's monthly benefit payable at unreduced retirement age in the normal form payable under the terms of the plan or in the form validly elected by the participant before the termination date;
(2) The calendar year in which the participant reaches unreduced retirement age (“URA”);
(3) The participant's URA; and
(4) The participant's earliest retirement age at the valuation date.
(c)
Procedure.
(1) The plan administrator shall determine whether a participant is in the high, medium, or low retirement rate category using the applicable Selection of Retirement Rate Category Table in § 4044.58, based on the participant's benefit determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the year in which the participant reaches URA.
(2) Based on the retirement rate category determined under paragraph (c)(1), the plan administrator shall determine the XRA from Table II-A, II-B or II-C, as appropriate, by using the participant's URA and earliest retirement age at valuation date.
[61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 89 FR 48306, June 6, 2024]
§ 4044.56
XRA when a participant need not retire to receive a benefit.
(a)
Applicability.
Except as provided in § 4044.57, the plan administrator shall determine the XRA under this section when plan provisions or established plan practice do not require a participant to retire from his or her job to begin receiving his or her early retirement benefit.
(b)
Data needed.
The plan administrator shall determine for each participant—
(1) The participant's URA; and
(2) The participant's earliest retirement age at valuation date.
(c)
Procedure.
Participants in this case are always assigned to the high retirement rate category and therefore the plan administrator shall use table II-C (Expected Retirement Ages for Individuals in the High Category) in § 4044.58 to determine the XRA. The plan administrator shall determine the XRA from table II-C by using the participant's URA and earliest retirement age at termination date.
[61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 89 FR 48306, June 6, 2024]
§ 4044.57
Special rule for facility closing.
(a)
Applicability.
The plan administrator shall determine the XRA under this section, rather than § 4044.55 or § 4044.56, when both the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section exist.
(1) The facility at which the participant is or was employed permanently closed within one year before the valuation date, or is in the process of being permanently closed on the valuation date.
(2) The participant left employment at the facility less than one year before the valuation date or was still employed at the facility on the valuation date.
(b)
XRA.
The XRA is equal to the earliest retirement age at valuation date.
§ 4044.58
Tables used to determine expected retirement age.
The following tables are used for determining expected retirement age under §§ 4044.55 through 4044.57.

# Non-Trusteed Plans
§ 4044.71
Valuation of annuity benefits.
The value of a benefit which is to be paid as an annuity is the cost of purchasing the annuity on the date of distribution from an insurer.
[61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 34606, June 14, 2011]
§ 4044.72
Form of annuity to be valued.
(a) When both the participant and beneficiary are alive on the date of distribution, the form of annuity to be valued is—
(1) For a participant or beneficiary already receiving a monthly benefit, that form which is being received, or
(2) For a participant or beneficiary not receiving a monthly benefit, the normal annuity form payable under the plan or the optional form for which the participant has made a valid election.
(b) When the participant dies after the date of plan termination but before the date of distribution, the form of annuity to be valued is determined under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section:
(1) For a participant who was entitled to a deferred annuity—
(i) If the form was a single or joint life annuity, no benefit shall be valued; or
(ii) If the participant had made a valid election of a lump sum benefit before he or she died, the form to be valued is the lump sum.
(2) For a participant who was eligible for immediate retirement, and for a participant who was in pay status at the date of termination—
(i) If the form was a single life annuity, no benefit shall be valued;
(ii) If the form was an annuity for a period certain and life thereafter, the form to be valued is an annuity for the certain period;
(iii) If the form was a joint and survivor annuity, the form to be valued is a single life annuity payable to the
beneficiary, unless the beneficiary has also died, in which case no benefit shall be valued;
(iv) If the form was an annuity for a period certain and joint and survivor thereafter, the form to be valued is an annuity for the certain period and the life of the beneficiary thereafter, unless the beneficiary has also died, in which case the form to be valued is an annuity for the certain period;
(v) If the form was a cash refund annuity, the form to be valued is the remaining lump sum death benefit; or
(vi) If the participant had elected a lump sum benefit before he or she died, the form to be valued is the lump sum.
(c) When the participant is still living and the named beneficiary or spouse dies after the date of termination but before the date of distribution, the form of annuity to be valued is determined under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section:
(1) For a participant entitled to a deferred annuity—
(i) If the form was a joint and survivor annuity, the form to be valued is a single life annuity payable to the participant; or
(ii) If the form was an annuity for a period certain and joint and survivor thereafter, the form to be valued is an annuity for the certain period and the life of the participant thereafter.
(2) For a participant eligible for immediate retirement and for a participant in pay status at the date of termination—
(i) If the form was a joint and survivor annuity, the form to be valued is a single life annuity payable to the participant; or
(ii) If the form was an annuity for a period certain and joint survivor thereafter annuity, the form to be valued is an annuity for the certain period and for the life of the participant thereafter.
[61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 34606, June 14, 2011]
§ 4044.73
Lump sums and other alternative forms of distribution in lieu of annuities.
(a)
Valuation.
(1) The value of the lump sum or other alternative form of distribution is the present value of the normal form of benefit provided by the plan payable at normal retirement age, determined as of the date of distribution using reasonable actuarial assumptions as to interest and mortality.
(2) If the participant dies before the date of distribution, but had elected a lump sum benefit, the present value shall be determined as if the participant were alive on the date of distribution.
(b)
Actuarial assumptions.
The plan administrator shall specify the actuarial assumptions used to determine the value calculated under paragraph (a) of this section when the plan administrator submits the benefit valuation data to the PBGC. The same actuarial assumptions shall be used for all such calculations. The PBGC reserves the right to review the actuarial assumptions used and to re-value the benefits determined by the plan administrator if the actuarial assumptions are found to be unreasonable.
[61 FR 34059, July 1, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 34606, June 14, 2011]
§ 4044.74
Withdrawal of employee contributions.
(a) If a participant has not started to receive monthly benefit payments on the date of distribution, the value of the lump sum which returns mandatory employee contributions is equal to the total amount of contributions made by the participant, plus interest that is payable to the participant under the terms of the plan, plus interest on that total amount from the date of termination to the date of distribution. The rate of interest credited on employee contributions up to the date of termination shall be the greater of the interest rate provided under the terms of the plan or the interest rate required under section 204(c) of ERISA or section 411(c) of the IRC.
(b) If a participant has started to receive monthly benefit payments on the date of distribution, part of which are attributable to his or her contributions, the value of the lump sum which returns employee contributions is equal to the excess of the amount described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section over the amount computed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(1) The amount of accumulated mandatory employee contributions remaining in the plan as of the date of termination plus interest from the date of termination to the date of distribution.
(2) The excess of benefit payments made from the plan between date of plan termination and the date of distribution, over the amount of payments that would have been made if the employee contributions had been paid as a lump sum on the date of plan termination, with interest accumulated on the excess from the date of payment to the date of distribution.
(c)
Interest assumptions.
The interest rate used under this section to credit interest between the date of termination to the date of distribution shall be a reasonable rate and shall be the same for both paragraphs (a) and (b).
§ 4044.75
Other lump sum benefits.
The value of a lump sum benefit which is not covered under § 4044.73 or § 4044.74 is equal to—
(a) The value under the irrevocable commitment, if an insurer provides the benefit; or
(b) The present value of the benefit as of the date of distribution, determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions, if the benefit is to be distributed other than by the purchase of the benefit from an insurer. The PBGC reserves the right to review the actuarial assumptions as to reasonableness and re-value the benefit if the actuarial assumptions are unreasonable.

§ 4047.1
Purpose and scope.
Section 4047 of ERISA gives the PBGC broad authority to take any necessary actions in furtherance of a plan restoration order issued pursuant to section 4047. This part (along with Treasury regulation 26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3) describes certain legal obligations that arise incidental to a plan restoration under section 4047. This part also establishes procedures with respect to these obligations that are intended to facilitate the orderly transition of a restored plan from terminated (or terminating) status to ongoing status, and to help ensure that the restored plan will continue to be ongoing consistent with the best interests of the plan's participants and beneficiaries and the single-employer insurance program. This part applies to terminated and terminating single-employer plans (except for plans terminated and terminating under ERISA section 4041(b)) with respect to which the PBGC has issued or is issuing a plan restoration order pursuant to ERISA section 4047.
§ 4047.2
Definitions.
The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: controlled group, ERISA, IRS, PBGC, plan, plan administrator, plan year, and single-employer plan.
§ 4047.3
Funding of restored plan.
(a)
General.
Whenever the PBGC issues or has issued a plan restoration order under ERISA section 4047, it shall issue to the plan sponsor a restoration payment schedule order in accordance with the rules of this section. PBGC, through its Executive Director, shall also issue a certification to its Board of Directors and the IRS, as described in paragraph (c) of this section. If more than one plan is or has been restored, the PBGC shall issue a separate restoration payment schedule order and separate certification with respect to each restored plan.
(b)
Restoration payment schedule order.
A restoration payment schedule order shall set forth a schedule of payments sufficient to amortize the initial restoration amortization base described in paragraph (b) of 26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3 over a period extending no more than 30 years after the initial post-restoration valuation date, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of 26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3. The restoration payment schedule shall be consistent with the requirements of 26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3 and may require payments at intervals of less than one year, as determined by the PBGC. The PBGC may, in its discretion, amend the restoration payment schedule at any time, consistent with the requirements of 26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3.
(c)
Certification.
The Executive Director's certification to the Board of Directors and the IRS pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall state that the PBGC has reviewed the funding of the plan, the financial condition of the plan sponsor and its controlled group members, the payments required under the restoration payment schedule (taking into account the availability of deferrals as permitted under paragraph (c)(4) of 26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3) and any other factor that the PBGC deems relevant, and, based on that review, determines that it is in the best interests of the plan's participants and beneficiaries and the single-employer insurance program that the restored plan not be reterminated.
(d)
Periodic PBGC review.
As long as a restoration payment schedule order issued under this section is in effect, the PBGC shall review annually the funding status of the plan with respect
to which the order applies. As part of this review, the PBGC, through its Executive Director, shall issue a certification in the form described in paragraph (c) of this section. As a result of its funding review, PBGC may amend the restoration payment schedule, consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of 26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3.

Upon restoration of a plan pursuant to ERISA section 4047, amounts paid by the PBGC from its single-employer insurance fund (the fund established pursuant to ERISA section 4005(a)) to pay guaranteed benefits and related expenses under the plan while it was terminated are a debt of the restored plan. The terms and conditions for payment of this debt shall be determined by the PBGC.
(b)
Repayment terms.

# Subpart A—Single-Employer Plans Covered by Title IV
§ 4050.101
Purpose and scope.
(a)
In general.
This subpart describes PBGC's missing participants program for single-employer defined benefit retirement plans covered by title IV of ERISA. The missing participants program is a program to hold retirement benefits for missing participants and beneficiaries in terminated retirement plans and to help them find and receive the benefits being held for them. For a plan to which this subpart applies, this subpart describes what the plan must do upon plan termination if it has missing participants or beneficiaries who are entitled to distributions. This subpart applies to a plan only if it is a single-employer defined benefit plan that—
(1) Is described in section 4021(a) of ERISA and not in any paragraph of section 4021(b) of ERISA and
(2) Terminates in a standard termination or in a distress termination described in section 4041(c)(3)(B)(i) or (ii) of ERISA (“sufficient distress termination”).
(b)
Plans that terminate but do not close out.
This subpart does not apply to a plan that terminates but does not close out, such as a plan that terminates in a distress termination described in section 4041(c)(3)(B)(iii) of ERISA (“insufficient distress termination”).
(c)
Individual account plans.
This subpart does not apply to an individual account plan under section 3(34) of ERISA, even if it is described in the same plan document as a plan to which this subpart applies. This subpart also does not apply to a plan to the extent that it is treated as an individual account plan under section 3(35)(B) of ERISA. For example, this subpart does not apply to employee contributions (or interest or earnings thereon) held as an individual account. (Subpart B deals with individual account plans.)
§ 4050.102
Definitions.
The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: Annuity, Code, ERISA, insurer, irrevocable commitment, PBGC, person, and plan administrator. In addition, for purposes of this subpart:
Accrual cessation date
for a participant under a subpart A plan means the date the participant stopped accruing benefits under the terms of the plan.
Accumulated single sum
means, with respect to a missing distributee, the distributee's benefit transfer amount accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the benefit determination date to the date when PBGC makes or commences payment to or with respect to the distributee.
Benefit determination date
with respect to a subpart A plan means the single date selected by the plan administrator for valuing benefits under § 4050.103(d); this date must be during the period beginning on the first day a distribution is made pursuant to close-out of the plan to a distributee who is not a missing distributee and ending on the last day such a distribution is made.
Benefit transfer amount
for a missing distributee of a subpart A plan means the amount determined by the plan administrator under § 4050.103(d) in the close-out of the plan.
Close-out
or
close out
with respect to a subpart A plan means the process of
the final distribution or transfer of assets pursuant to the termination of the plan.
De minimis
means, with respect to the value of a benefit (or other amount), that the value does not exceed the amount specified under section 203(e)(1) of ERISA and section 411(a)(11)(A) of the Code (without regard to plan provisions).
Distributee
means, with respect to a subpart A plan, a participant or beneficiary entitled to a distribution under the plan pursuant to the close-out of the plan.
Missing,
with respect to a distributee under a subpart A plan, means that any one or more of the following three conditions exists upon close-out of the plan.
(1) The plan administrator does not know with reasonable certainty the location of the distributee.
(2) Under the terms of the plan, the distributee's benefit is to be paid in a lump sum without the distributee's consent, and the distributee has not responded to a notice about the distribution of the lump sum.
(3) Under the terms of the plan and any election made by the distributee, the distributee's benefit is to be paid in a lump sum, but the distributee does not accept the lump sum. For this purpose, a lump sum paid by check is not accepted if the check remains uncashed after—
(i) A “cash-by” date prescribed (on the check or in an accompanying notice) that is at least 45 days after the issuance of the check, or
(ii) If no such “cash-by” date is so prescribed, the check's stale date.
Missing participants forms and instructions
means the forms and instructions provided by PBGC for use in connection with the missing participants program.
Missing participants interest rate
means, for each month, the applicable federal mid-term rate (as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to section 1274(d)(1)(C)(ii) of the Code) for that month, compounded monthly.
Normal retirement date
for a participant under a subpart A plan means the normal retirement date of the participant under the terms of the plan.
Pay-status
or
pay status
means one of the following (according to context):
(1) With respect to a benefit, that payment of the benefit has actually started before the benefit determination date; or
(2) With respect to a distributee, that payment of the distributee's benefit has actually started before the benefit determination date.
PBGC missing participants assumptions
means the actuarial assumptions prescribed in §§ 4044.51 through 4044.58 of this chapter with the following modifications:
(1) The present value is determined as of the benefit determination date instead of the plan termination date.
(2) The mortality assumption is the mortality table in § 4044.53(h) of this chapter.
(3) No adjustment is made for loading expenses under § 4044.52(d) of this chapter.
(4) The interest assumption is the assumption for valuing benefits under § 4044.54 of this chapter applicable to valuations occurring on December 31 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the benefit determination date occurs. However, for benefit determination dates July 31 through December 31 of 2024, the interest assumption is the assumption for valuing benefits under § 4044.54 of this chapter applicable to valuations occurring on July 31, 2024.
(5) The assumed payment form of a benefit not in pay status is a straight life annuity.
(6) Pre-retirement death benefits are disregarded.
(7) Notwithstanding the expected retirement age (XRA) assumptions in §§ 4044.55 through 4044.58 of this chapter—
(i) In the case of a participant who is not in pay status and whose normal retirement date is on or after the benefit determination date, benefits are assumed to commence at the XRA, determined using the high retirement rate category under table II-C (Expected Retirement Ages for Individuals in the High Category) in § 4044.58 of this chapter;
(ii) In the case of a participant who is not in pay status and whose normal retirement date is before the benefit determination date, benefits are assumed to commence on the participant's normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later);
(iii) In the case of a participant who is in pay status, benefits are assumed to commence on the date on which benefits actually commenced; and
(iv) In the case of a beneficiary, benefits are assumed to commence on the benefit determination date or, if later, the earliest date the beneficiary can begin to receive benefits.
Plan lump sum assumptions
means, with respect to a subpart A plan, the following:
(1) If the plan specifies actuarial assumptions and methods to be used to calculate a lump sum distribution, such actuarial assumptions and methods, or
(2) Otherwise, the actuarial assumptions specified under section 205(g)(3) of ERISA and section 417(e)(3) of the Code, determined as of the benefit determination date, including use of the missing participants interest rate to calculate the present value as of the benefit determination date of a payment or payments missed in the past.
QDRO
means a qualified domestic relations order as defined in section 206(d)(3) of ERISA and section 414(p) of the Code.
Qualified survivor
of a participant or beneficiary under a subpart A plan means, for any benefit with respect to the participant or beneficiary,—
(1) A person who survives the participant or beneficiary and is entitled under applicable provisions of a QDRO to receive the benefit;
(2) A person that is identified by the plan in a submission to PBGC by the plan as being entitled under applicable plan provisions (including elections, designations, and waivers consistent with such provisions) to receive the benefit; or
(3) If no such person is so entitled, a survivor of the participant or beneficiary who is the participant's or beneficiary's living—
(i) Spouse, or if none,
(ii) Child, or if none,

[82 FR 60818, Dec. 22, 2017, as amended at 89 FR 48308, June 6, 2024]
§ 4050.103
Duties of plan administrator.
(a)
Providing for benefits.
For each distributee who is missing upon close-out of a subpart A plan, the plan administrator must provide for the distributee's plan benefits either—
(1) By purchasing an irrevocable commitment from an insurer, or
(2) By—
(i) Determining the distributee's benefit transfer amount under paragraph (d) of this section, and
(ii) Transferring to PBGC as described in this subpart A an amount equal to the distributee's benefit transfer amount.
(b)
Diligent search.
For each distributee whose location the plan administrator does not know with reasonable certainty upon close-out of a subpart A plan, the plan administrator must have conducted a diligent search as described in § 4050.104.
(c)
Filing with PBGC.
For each distributee who is missing upon close-out of a subpart A plan, the plan administrator must file with PBGC as described in § 4050.105.
(d)
Benefit transfer amount.
The benefit transfer amount for a missing distributee is the amount determined by the plan administrator as of the benefit determination date using whichever one of the following three methods applies:
(1)
De minimis.
If the single sum actuarial equivalent of the distributee's benefits (including any payments missed in the past) determined using plan lump sum assumptions is de minimis, then the missing distributee's benefit transfer amount is equal to that single sum.
(2)
Non-de minimis; single sum payment cannot be elected.
If the single sum actuarial equivalent of the distributee's benefits (including any payments missed in the past) determined using plan lump sum assumptions is not de minimis, and a single sum payment cannot be elected, then the missing
distributee's benefit transfer amount is the present value of the distributee's accrued benefit determined using PBGC missing participants assumptions, plus
(i) For a missing distributee not in pay status whose normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later) precedes the benefit determination date, the aggregate value of payments of the straight life annuity that would have been payable beginning on the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later), accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the benefit determination date, assuming that the distributee survived to the benefit determination date, as determined by the plan administrator; or
(ii) For a missing distributee in pay status, the aggregate value of payments of the pay status annuity due but not made, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from each payment due date to the benefit determination date, assuming that the distributee survived to the benefit determination date.
(3)
Non-de minimis; single sum payment can be elected.
If the single sum actuarial equivalent of the distributee's benefits (including any payments missed in the past) determined using plan lump sum assumptions is not de minimis, and a single sum payment can be elected, then the missing distributee's benefit transfer amount is the greater of the amounts determined using the methodology in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section.
§ 4050.104
Diligent search.
(a)
Search requirement.
The plan administrator of a subpart A plan must, within the time frame described in paragraph (d) of this section, have diligently searched for each distributee of the plan whose location the plan administrator does not know with reasonable certainty upon close-out, using one of the following two methods:
(1) For any distributee, regardless of the size of the distributee's benefit, the commercial locator service method described in paragraph (b) of this section; or
(2) For a distributee whose normal retirement benefit is not more than $50 per month, the records search method described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Commercial locator service method
—(1)
In general.
Using the commercial locator service method means paying a commercial locator service to search for information to locate a distributee.
(2)
Meaning of “commercial locator service.”
For purposes of this section, a commercial locator service is a business that holds itself out as a finder of lost persons for compensation using information from a database maintained by a consumer reporting agency (as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1681a(f)).
(c)
Records search method
—(1)
In general.
Using the records search method means searching for information to locate a distributee by doing all of the following to the extent reasonably feasible and affordable:
(i) Searching the records of the plan for information to locate the distributee.
(ii) Searching the records of the plan's contributing sponsor that is the most recent employer of the distributee for information to locate the distributee.
(iii) Searching the records of each retirement or welfare plan of the plan's contributing sponsor in which the distributee was a participant for information to locate the distributee.
(iv) Contacting each beneficiary of the distributee identified from the records referred to in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section for information to locate the distributee.
(v) Using an internet search method for which no fee is charged, such as a search engine, a network database, a public record database (such as those for licenses, mortgages, and real estate taxes) or a “social media” website.
(2)
Limits on method.
For purposes of this section—
(i) Searching is not feasible to the extent that, as a practical matter, it is thwarted by legal or practical lack of access to records, and
(ii) Searching is not affordable to the extent that the cost of searching (including the value of labor) is more than a reasonable fraction of the benefit of the distributee being searched for. In
no event would searching need to be pursued beyond the point where the cost equals the value of the benefit.
(d)
Time frame.
A search for a distributee under this section must have been made within nine months before a filing is made under § 4050.105 identifying the distributee as a missing distributee.
§ 4050.105
Filing with PBGC.
(a)
What to file.
The plan administrator of a subpart A plan must file with PBGC the information specified in the missing participants forms and instructions and, for a missing distributee referred to in § 4050.103(a)(2), payment of—
(1) The benefit transfer amount for the missing distributee;
(2) If the benefit transfer amount is paid more than 90 days after the benefit determination date, interest on the benefit transfer amount computed at the missing participants interest rate for the period beginning on the 90th day after the benefit determination date and ending on the date the benefit transfer amount is paid to PBGC; and
(3) Any fee provided for in the missing participants forms and instructions.
(b)
When to file.
The plan administrator must file the information and payments referred to in paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with the missing participants forms and instructions. Payment of a benefit transfer amount will, if considered timely made for purposes of this paragraph (b), be considered timely made for purposes of part 4041 of this chapter.
(c)
Place, method and date of filing; time periods.
(1) For rules about where to file, see § 4000.4 of this chapter.
(2) For rules about permissible methods of filing with PBGC under this subpart, see subpart A of part 4000 of this chapter.
(3) For rules about the date that a submission under this subpart was filed with PBGC, see subpart C of part 4000 of this chapter.
(4) For rules about any time period for filing under this subpart, see subpart D of part 4000 of this chapter.
(d)
Supplemental information.
Within 30 days after a written request by PBGC (or such other time as may be specified in the request), the plan administrator of a subpart A plan required to file under paragraph (a) of this section must file with PBGC supplemental information for any proper purpose under the missing participants program.
(e)
Reliance.
As administrator of the missing participants program, PBGC will rely on determinations made and information reported by plan administrators in connection with the program. This reliance does not affect PBGC's authority as administrator of the title IV insurance program to audit or make inquiries of subpart A plans, including about the amount to which a missing distributee may be entitled.
§ 4050.106
Missing participant benefits.
(a)
In general
—(1)

The annuity described in this paragraph (d)(1) is either—
(i)
Straight life annuity.
A straight life annuity in the amount that the subpart A plan would have paid the participant, starting at the date that PBGC payments start (or, if earlier, the later of the participant's normal retirement date or accrual cessation date), as reported to PBGC by the subpart A plan (including any early retirement subsidies), or through linear interpolation for participants who start payments between integral ages; or
(ii)
Other form of annuity.
At the participant's election, any form of annuity available to the participant under § 4022.8 of this chapter, in an amount that is actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section as of the date that PBGC payments start (or, if earlier, the later of the participant's normal retirement date or accrual cessation date), determined using the actuarial assumptions in § 4022.8(c)(7) of this chapter.

The make-up amount described in this paragraph (i)(2)(i) is a lump sum equal to the aggregate value of payments of the survivor portion of the joint and 50 percent survivor annuity described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section that would have been payable to the spouse beginning on the later of the participant's date of death or the date when the participant would have reached age 55, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the date when PBGC pays the spouse.
(ii)
Payments from normal retirement date to participant's death.
The make-up amount described in this paragraph (i)(2)(ii) is a lump sum equal to the aggregate value of payments (if any) of the joint portion of the joint and 50 percent survivor annuity described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section that would have been payable to the participant from the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later) to
the participant's date of death thereafter, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the date when PBGC pays the spouse.
(3)
Small benefit.
If the sum of the actuarial present value of the annuity described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section plus the make-up amounts described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section is de minimis, then the lump sum that PBGC will pay the spouse under this paragraph (i)(3) is an amount equal to that sum.

If a subpart A plan reports to PBGC that a portion of a missing participant's benefit transfer amount represents accumulated contributions as described in section 204(c)(2)(C) of ERISA and section 411(c)(2)(C) of the Code, PBGC will pay with respect to the missing participant at least the amount of accumulated contributions as reported by the subpart A plan, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the benefit determination date to the date when PBGC makes payment.
(l)
Date for determining marital status.
For purposes of this section, whether a participant is married, and if so the identity of the spouse, is determined as of the earlier of—

# Subpart B—Defined Contribution Plans
§ 4050.201
Purpose and scope.
(a)
In general.
This subpart describes PBGC's missing participants program for single-employer and multiemployer defined contribution retirement plans. The missing participants program is a program to hold retirement benefits for missing participants and beneficiaries in terminated retirement plans and to help them find and receive the benefits being held for them. For a plan to which this subpart applies, this subpart
describes what the plan must do upon plan termination if it elects to use the missing participants program for missing participants and beneficiaries who are entitled to distributions. This subpart applies to a plan only if it is a plan—
(1) That—
(i) Is a defined contribution (individual account) plan described in section 3(34) of ERISA; or
(ii) Is treated as a defined contribution (individual account) plan under section (3)(35) of ERISA (to the extent so treated);
(2) That is described in section 4021(a) of ERISA and not in any paragraph of section 4021(b) of ERISA other than paragraph (1), (5), (12), or (13), including a plan described in section 403(b) of the Code under which benefits are provided through custodial accounts described in section 403(b)(7) of the Code;
(3) That, if it is a transferring plan, pays all benefit transfer amounts to PBGC in money, consistent with plan provisions and applicable law; and
(4) That terminates and closes out.
(b)
Defined contribution plans that are part of defined benefit plans.
This subpart does not fail to apply to a plan merely because the plan is described in the same plan document as a defined benefit plan (to which this subpart does not apply). For example, this subpart may apply to employee contributions (or interest or earnings thereon) held as an individual account under a defined benefit plan.
(c)
Defined contribution plans that are abandoned plans.
This subpart does not fail to apply to a plan merely because the plan is an abandoned plan, as defined in 29 CFR 2578.1.

§ 4050.303
Options and duties of plan administrator.
(a)
Options.
The plan administrator of a subpart C plan that is closing out upon plan termination may (but need not), by filing under § 4050.305, elect that the subpart C plan—
(1) Will be a “transferring plan,” that is, will pay a benefit transfer amount to PBGC for each distributee who is missing upon close-out of the subpart C plan and will be bound by the provisions of this subpart C to the extent that they apply to transferring plans, or
(2) Will be a “notifying plan,” that is, will notify PBGC of the disposition of the benefits of each distributee identified in the filing who is missing upon close-out of the plan and will, with respect to those distributees, be bound by the provisions of this subpart C to the extent that they apply to notifying plans.
(b)
Diligent search
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for each distributee whose location the plan administrator does not know with reasonable certainty upon close-out of a subpart C plan, the plan administrator must have conducted a diligent search as described in § 4050.304.
(2)
Notifying plans.
For a notifying plan, the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies only to distributees identified in the filing with PBGC.
(c)
Filing with PBGC
—(1)

Non-de minimis; single sum payment cannot be elected.
If the single sum actuarial equivalent of the distributee's benefits (including any payments missed in the past) determined using plan lump sum assumptions is not de minimis, and a single sum payment cannot be elected, then the missing distributee's benefit transfer amount is the present value of the distributee's accrued benefit determined using PBGC missing participants assumptions, plus
(i) For a missing distributee not in pay status whose normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later) precedes the benefit determination date, the aggregate value of payments of the straight life annuity that would have been payable beginning on the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later), accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the benefit determination date, assuming that the distributee survived to the benefit determination date, as determined by the plan administrator; or
(ii) For a missing distributee in pay status, the aggregate value of payments of the pay status annuity due
but not made, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from each payment due date to the benefit determination date, assuming that the distributee survived to the benefit determination date.
(3)
Non-de minimis; single sum payment can be elected.
If the single sum actuarial equivalent of the distributee's benefits (including any payments missed in the past) determined using plan lump sum assumptions is not de minimis, and a single sum payment can be elected, then the missing distributee's benefit transfer amount is the greater of the amounts determined using the methodology in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section.
§ 4050.304
Diligent search.
(a)
Search requirement.
For each distributee of a subpart C plan who is described in § 4050.303(b), the plan administrator must, within the time frame described in paragraph (d) of this section, have diligently searched for each distributee of the plan whose location the plan administrator does not know with reasonable certainty upon close out, using one of the following two methods:
(1) For any distributee, regardless of the size of the distributee's benefit, the commercial locator service method described in paragraph (b) of this section; or
(2) For a distributee whose normal retirement benefit is not more than $50 per month, the records search method described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Commercial locator service method
—(1)
In general.
Using the commercial locator service method means paying a commercial locator service to search for information to locate a distributee.
(2)
Meaning of “commercial locator service.”
For purposes of this section, a commercial locator service is a business that holds itself out as a finder of lost persons for compensation using information from a database maintained by a consumer reporting agency (as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1681a(f)).
(c)
Records search method
—(1)
In general.
Using the records search method means searching for information to locate a distributee by doing all of the following to the extent reasonably feasible and affordable:
(i) Searching the records of the plan for information to locate the distributee.
(ii) Searching the records of the plan's contributing sponsor that is the most recent employer of the distributee for information to locate the distributee.
(iii) Searching the records of each retirement or welfare plan of the plan's contributing sponsor in which the distributee was a participant for information to locate the distributee.
(iv) Contacting each beneficiary of the distributee identified from the records referred to in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section for information to locate the distributee.
(v) Using an internet search method for which no fee is charged, such as a search engine, a network database, a public record database (such as those for licenses, mortgages, and real estate taxes) or a “social media” website.
(2)
Limits on method.
For purposes of this section—
(i) Searching is not feasible to the extent that, as a practical matter, it is thwarted by legal or practical lack of access to records, and
(ii) Searching is not affordable to the extent that the cost of searching (including the value of labor) is more than a reasonable fraction of the benefit of the distributee being searched for. In no event would searching need to be pursued beyond the point where the cost equals the value of the benefit.
(d)
Time frame.
A search for a distributee under this section must have been made within nine months before a filing is made under § 4050.305 identifying the distributee as a missing distributee.

# Subpart D—Multiemployer Plans Covered by Title IV
§ 4050.401
Purpose and scope.
(a)
In general.
This subpart describes PBGC's missing participants program for multiemployer defined benefit retirement plans covered by title IV of ERISA. The missing participants program is a program to hold retirement benefits for missing participants and beneficiaries in retirement plans that are closing out and to help them find and receive the benefits being held for them. For a plan to which this subpart applies, this subpart describes what the plan must do upon plan termination if it has missing participants or beneficiaries who are entitled to distributions. This subpart applies to a plan only if it is a multiemployer defined benefit plan that—
(1) Is described in section 4021(a) of ERISA and not in any paragraph of section 4021(b) of ERISA, and
(2) Completes the process of closing out under subpart D of PBGC's regulation on Termination of Multiemployer Plans (29 CFR part 4041A).
(b)
Plans that terminate but do not close out.
This subpart does not apply to plans that terminate but do not close out.
(c)
Individual account plans.
This subpart does not apply to an individual account plan under section 3(34) of ERISA, even if it is described in the same plan document as a plan to which this subpart applies. This subpart also does not apply to a plan to the extent that it is treated as an individual account plan under section 3(35)(B) of ERISA. For example, this subpart does not apply to employee contributions
(or interest or earnings thereon) held as an individual account. (Subpart B deals with individual account plans.)

Accumulated single sum
means, with respect to a missing distributee, the distributee's benefit transfer amount accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the benefit determination date to the date when PBGC makes or commences payment to or with respect to the distributee.
Benefit determination date
with respect to a subpart D plan means the single date selected by the plan sponsor for valuing benefits under § 4050.103(d); this date must be during the period beginning on the first day a distribution is made pursuant to close-out of the plan to a distributee who is not a missing distributee and ending on the last day such a distribution is made.
Benefit transfer amount
for a missing distributee of a subpart D plan means the amount determined by the plan sponsor under § 4050.403(d) in the close-out of the plan.
Close-out
or
close out
with respect to a subpart D plan means the process of the final distribution or transfer of assets in satisfaction of plan benefits.
De minimis
means, with respect to the value of a benefit (or other amount), that the value does not exceed the amount specified under section 203(e)(1) of ERISA and section 411(a)(11)(A) of the Code (without regard to plan provisions).
Distributee
means, with respect to a subpart D plan, a participant or beneficiary entitled to a distribution under the subpart D plan pursuant to the close-out of the subpart D plan.

(3) Under the terms of the plan and any election made by the distributee, the distributee's benefit is to be paid in a lump sum, but the distributee does not accept the lump sum. For this purpose, a lump sum paid by check is not accepted if the check remains uncashed after—
(i) A “cash-by” date prescribed (on the check or in an accompanying notice) that is at least 45 days after the issuance of the check, or
(ii) If no such “cash-by” date is so prescribed, the check's stale date.

§ 4050.403
Duties of plan sponsor.
(a)
Providing for benefits.
For each distributee who is missing upon close-out of a subpart D plan, the plan sponsor must provide for the distributee's plan benefits either—
(1) By purchase of an annuity contract from an insurer; or
(2) By—
(i) Determining the distributee's benefit transfer amount under paragraph (e) of this section, and
(ii) Transferring to PBGC as described in this subpart D an amount
equal to the distributee's benefit transfer amount.
(b)
Diligent search.
For each distributee whose location the plan sponsor does not know with reasonable certainty upon close-out of a subpart D plan, the plan sponsor must have conducted a diligent search as described in § 4050.404.
(c)
Filing with PBGC.
For each distributee who is missing upon close-out of a subpart D plan, the plan sponsor must file with PBGC as described in § 4050.405.
(d)
Benefit transfer amount.
The benefit transfer amount for a missing distributee is the amount determined by the plan sponsor as of the benefit determination date using whichever one of the following three methods applies:
(1)
De minimis.
If the single sum actuarial equivalent of the distributee's benefits (including any payments missed in the past) determined using plan lump sum assumptions is de minimis, then the missing distributee's benefit transfer amount is equal to that single sum.
(2)
Non-de minimis; single sum payment cannot be elected.
If the single sum actuarial equivalent of the distributee's benefits (including any payments missed in the past) determined using plan lump sum assumptions is not de minimis, and a single sum payment cannot be elected, then the missing distributee's benefit transfer amount is the present value of the distributee's accrued benefit determined using PBGC missing participants assumptions, plus
(i) For a missing distributee not in pay status whose normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later) precedes the benefit determination date, the aggregate value of payments of the straight life annuity that would have been payable beginning on the normal retirement date (or accrual cessation date if later), accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from the date each payment would have been made to the benefit determination date, assuming that the distributee survived to the benefit determination date, as determined by the plan sponsor; or
(ii) For a missing distributee in pay status, the aggregate value of payments of the pay status annuity due but not made, accumulated at the missing participants interest rate from each payment due date to the benefit determination date, assuming that the distributee survived to the benefit determination date.
(3)
Non-de minimis; single sum payment can be elected.
If the single sum actuarial equivalent of the distributee's benefits (including any payments missed in the past) determined using plan lump sum assumptions is not de minimis, and a single sum payment can be elected, then the missing distributee's benefit transfer amount is the greater of the amounts determined using the methodology in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section.
§ 4050.404
Diligent search.
(a)
Search requirement.
The plan sponsor of a subpart D plan must, within the time frame described in paragraph (d) of this section, have diligently searched for each distributee of the plan whose location the plan sponsor does not know with reasonable certainty upon close-out, using one of the following two methods:
(1) For any distributee, regardless of the size of the distributee's benefit, the commercial locator service method described in paragraph (b) of this section; or
(2) For a distributee whose normal retirement benefit is not more than $50 per month, the records search method described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Commercial locator service method
—(1)
In general.
Using the commercial locator service method means paying a commercial locator service to search for information to locate a distributee.
(2)
Meaning of “commercial locator service.”
For purposes of this section, a commercial locator service is a business that holds itself out as a finder of lost persons for compensation using information from a database maintained by a consumer reporting agency (as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1681a(f)).
(c)
Records search method
—(1)
In general.
Using the records search method means searching for information to locate a distributee by doing all of the following to the extent reasonably feasible and affordable:

(iii) Searching the records of each retirement or welfare plan of the contributing sponsor in which the distributee was a participant for information to locate the distributee.
(iv) Contacting each beneficiary of the distributee identified from the records referred to in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section for information to locate the distributee.
(v) Using an internet search method for which no fee is charged, such as a search engine, a network database, a public record database (such as those for licenses, mortgages, and real estate taxes) or a “social media” website.
(2)
Limits on method.
For purposes of this section,—
(i) Searching is not feasible to the extent that, as a practical matter, it is thwarted by legal or practical lack of access to records, and
(ii) Searching is not affordable to the extent that the cost of searching (including the value of labor) is more than a reasonable fraction of the benefit of the distributee being searched for. In no event would searching need to be pursued beyond the point where the cost equals the value of the benefit.
(d)
Time frame.
A search for a distributee under this section must have been made within nine months before a filing is made under § 4050.405 identifying the distributee as a missing distributee.
§ 4050.405
Filing with PBGC.
(a)
What to file.
The plan sponsor of a subpart D plan must file with PBGC the information specified in the missing participants forms and instructions and, for a missing distributee referred to in § 4050.403(a)(2), payment of—
(1) The benefit transfer amount for the missing distributee;
(2) If the benefit transfer amount is paid more than 90 days after the benefit determination date, interest on the benefit transfer amount computed at the missing participants interest rate for the period beginning on the 90th day after the benefit determination date and ending on the date the benefit transfer amount is paid to PBGC; and
(3) Any fee provided for in the missing participants forms and instructions.
(b)
When to file.
The plan sponsor must file the information and payments referred to in paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with the missing participants forms and instructions. Payment of a benefit transfer amount will, if considered timely made for purposes of this paragraph (b), be considered timely made for purposes of part 4041A of this chapter.
(c)
Place, method and date of filing; time periods.
(1) For rules about where to file, see § 4000.4 of this chapter.
(2) For rules about permissible methods of filing with PBGC under this subpart, see subpart A of part 4000 of this chapter.

(e)
Reliance.
As administrator of the missing participants program, PBGC will rely on determinations made and information reported by plan sponsors in connection with the program.

§ 4062.1
Purpose and scope.
The purpose of this part is to set forth rules for determination and payment of the liability incurred, under section 4062(b) of ERISA, upon termination of any single-employer plan and, to the extent appropriate, determination of the liability incurred with respect to multiple employer plans under sections 4063 and 4064 of ERISA. This part also sets forth rules for determining the amount of liability incurred under section 4063 of ERISA pursuant to the occurrence of a cessation of operations as described by section 4062(e) of ERISA. The provisions of this part regarding the amount of liability to the PBGC that is incurred upon termination of a single-employer plan apply with respect to a plan for which a notice of intent to terminate under section 4041(c) of ERISA is issued or proceedings to terminate under section 4042 of ERISA are instituted after December 17, 1987. Those provisions also apply, to the extent described in paragraph (a) of this section, to the amount of liability for withdrawal from a multiple employer plan after that date.
[61 FR 34079, July 1, 1996, as amended at 71 FR 34822, June 16, 2006]
§ 4062.2
Definitions.
The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: benefit liabilities, Code, contributing sponsor, controlled group, ERISA, fair market value, guaranteed benefit, multiple employer plan, notice of intent to terminate, PBGC, person, plan, plan administrator, proposed termination date, single-employer plan, and termination date.
In addition, for purposes of this part, the term
collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination
means the sum of the individual net worths of all persons that have individual net worths which are greater than zero and that (as of the termination date) are contributing sponsors of the terminated plan or members of their controlled groups, as determined in accordance with section 4062(d)(1) of ERISA and § 4062.4 of this part.
§ 4062.3
Amount and payment of section 4062(b) liability.
(a)
Amount of liability
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the amount of section 4062(b) liability is the total amount (as of the termination date) of the unfunded benefit liabilities (within the meaning of section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA) to all participants and beneficiaries under the plan, together with
interest calculated from the termination date in accordance with § 4062.7.
(2)
Special rule in case of subsequent finding of inability to pay guaranteed benefits.
In any distress termination proceeding under section 4041(c) of ERISA and part 4041 of this chapter in which (as described in section 4041(c)(3)(C)(ii) of ERISA), after a determination that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities or for guaranteed benefits, the plan administrator finds that the plan is or will be insufficient for guaranteed benefits and the PBGC concurs with that finding, or the PBGC makes such a finding on its own initiative, actuarial present values shall be determined as of the date of the notice to, or the finding by, the PBGC of insufficiency for guaranteed benefits.
(b)
Payment of liability.
Section 4062(b) liability is due and payable as of the termination date, in cash or securities acceptable to the PBGC, except that, as provided in § 4062.9(c), the PBGC shall prescribe commercially reasonable terms for payment of so much of such liability as exceeds 30 percent of the collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination. The PBGC may make alternative arrangements, as provided in § 4062.9(b).
[61 FR 34079, July 1, 1996, as amended at 71 FR 34822, June 16, 2006]
§ 4062.4
Determinations of net worth and collective net worth.
(a)
General rules.
When a contributing sponsor, or member(s) of a contributing sponsor's controlled group, notifies and submits information to the PBGC in accordance with § 4062.6, the PBGC shall determine the net worth, as of the net worth record date, of that contributing sponsor and any members of its controlled group based on the factors set forth in paragraph (c) of this section and shall include the value of any assets that it determines, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, have been improperly transferred. In making such determinations, the PBGC will consider information submitted pursuant to § 4062.6. The PBGC shall then determine the collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination.
(b)
Partnerships and sole proprietorships.
In the case of a person that is a partnership or a sole proprietorship, net worth does not include the personal assets and liabilities of the partners or sole proprietor, except for the assets included pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. As used in this paragraph, “personal assets” are those assets which do not produce income for the business being valued or are not used in the business.
(c)
Factors for determining net worth.
A person's net worth is to be determined on the basis of the factors set forth below in this section, to the extent relevant; different factors may be considered with respect to different portions of the person's operations. Generally, fair market value, as defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter, is to be used. As appropriate, fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) is to be used.
(1) A bona fide sale of, agreement to sell, or offer to purchase or sell the business of the person made on or about the net worth record date.
(2) A bona fide sale of, agreement to sell, or offer to purchase or sell stock or a partnership interest in the person, made on or about the net worth record date.
(3) If stock in the person is publicly traded, the price of such stock on or about the net worth record date.
(4) The price/earnings ratios and prices of stocks of similar trades or businesses on or about the net worth record date.
(5) The person's economic outlook, as reflected by its earnings and dividend projections, current financial condition, and business history.
(6) The economic outlook for the person's industry and the market it serves.
(7) The appraised value, including the liquidating value, of the person's tangible and intangible assets.
(8) The value of the equity assumed in a plan of reorganization of a person in a case under title 11, United States Code, or any similar law of a state or political subdivision thereof.
(9) Any other factor relevant in determining the person's net worth.
(d)
Improper transfers.
A person's net worth shall include the value of any assets transferred by the person which the PBGC determines were improperly transferred for the purpose, as inferred from all the facts and circumstances, and with the effect of avoiding liability under this part. Assets “improperly transferred” include but are not limited to assets sold, leased or otherwise transferred for less than adequate consideration and assets distributed as gifts, capital distributions and stock redemptions inconsistent with past practices of the employer. The word
transfer
includes but is not limited to sales, assignments, pledges, leases, gifts and dividends.
[61 FR 34079, July 1, 1996, as amended at 88 FR 44052, July 11, 2023]
§ 4062.5
Net worth record date.
(a)
General.
Unless the PBGC establishes an earlier net worth record date pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the net worth record date, for all purposes under this part, is the plan's termination date.
(b)
Establishment of an earlier net worth record date.
At any time during a termination proceeding, the PBGC, in order to prevent undue loss to or abuse of the plan termination insurance system, may establish as the net worth record date an earlier date during the 120-day period ending with the termination date.
(c)
Notification.
Whenever the PBGC establishes an earlier net worth record date, it shall immediately give liable person(s) written notification of that fact. The written notice may also include a request for additional information, as provided in § 4062.6(a)(3).
§ 4062.6
Net worth notification and information.
(a)
General.
(1) A contributing sponsor or member of the contributing sponsor's controlled group that believes section 4062(b) liability exceeds 30 percent of the collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination shall—
(i) So notify the PBGC by the 90th day after the notice of intent to terminate is filed with the PBGC or, if no notice of intent to terminate is filed with the PBGC and the PBGC institutes proceedings under section 4042 of ERISA, within 30 days after the establishment of the plan's termination date in such proceedings; and
(ii) Submit to the PBGC the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the contributing sponsor and each member of the contributing sponsor's controlled group (if any)—
(A) By the 120th day after the proposed termination date, or
(B) If no notice of intent to terminate is filed with the PBGC and the PBGC institutes proceedings under section 4042 of ERISA, within 120 days after the establishment of the plan's termination date in such proceedings.
(2) If a contributing sponsor or a member of its controlled group complies with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the PBGC will consider the requirements to be satisfied by all members of that controlled group.
(3) The PBGC may require any person subject to liability—
(i) To submit the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section within a shorter period whenever the PBGC believes that its ability to obtain information or payment of liability is in jeopardy, and
(ii) To submit additional information within 30 days, or a different specified time, after the PBGC's written notification that it needs such information to make net worth determinations.
(4) If a provision of paragraph (b) of this section or a PBGC notice specifies information previously submitted to the PBGC, a person may respond by identifying the previous submission in which the response was provided.
(b)
Net worth information.
The following information specifications apply, individually, with respect to each person subject to liability:
(1) An estimate, made in accordance with § 4062.4, of the person's net worth on the net worth record date and a statement, with supporting evidence, of the basis for the estimate.
(2) A copy of the person's audited (or if not available, unaudited) financial statements for the 5 full fiscal years plus any partial fiscal year preceding
the net worth record date. The statements must include balance sheets, income statements, and statements of changes in financial position and must be accompanied by the annual reports, if available.
(3) A statement of all sales and copies of all offers or agreements to buy or sell at least 25 percent of the person's assets or at least 5 percent of the person's stock or partnership interest, made on or about the net worth record date.
(4) A statement of the person's current financial condition and business history.
(5) A statement of the person's business plans, including projected earnings and, if available, dividend projections.
(6) Any appraisal of the person's fixed and intangible assets made on or about the net worth record date.
(7) A copy of any plan of reorganization, whether or not confirmed, with respect to a case under title 11, United States Code, or any similar law of a state or political subdivision thereof, involving the person and occurring within 5 calendar years prior to or any time after the net worth record date.
(c)
Incomplete submission.
If a contributing sponsor and/or members of the contributing sponsor's controlled group do not submit all of the information required pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section (other than the estimate described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) with respect to each person subject to liability, the PBGC may base determinations of net worth and the collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination on any such information that such person(s) did submit, as well as any other pertinent information that the PBGC may have. In general, the PBGC will view information as of a date further removed from the net worth record date as having less probative value than information as of a date nearer to the net worth record date.
§ 4062.7
Calculating interest on liability and refunds of overpayments.
(a)
Interest.
Whether or not the PBGC has granted deferred payment terms pursuant to § 4062.9, the amount of liability under this part includes interest, from the termination date, on any unpaid portion of the liability. Such interest accrues at the rate set forth in paragraph (c) of this section until the liability is paid in full and is compounded daily. When liability under this part is paid in more than one payment, the PBGC will apply each payment to the satisfaction of accrued interest and then to the reduction of principal.
(b)
Refunds.
If a contributing sponsor or member(s) of a contributing sponsor's controlled group pays the PBGC an amount that exceeds the full amount of liability under this part, the PBGC shall refund the excess amount, with interest at the rate set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. Interest on an overpayment accrues from the later of the date of the overpayment or 10 days prior to the termination date until the date of the refund and is compounded daily.
(c)
Interest rate.
The interest rate on liability under this part and refunds thereof is the annual rate prescribed in section 6601(a) of the Code, and will change whenever the interest rate under section 6601(a) of the Code changes.
[61 FR 34079, July 1, 1996, as amended at 71 FR 34822, June 16, 2006]
§ 4062.8
Liability pursuant to section 4062(e).
(a)
Liability amount.
If, pursuant to section 4062(e) of ERISA, an employer ceases operations at a facility in any location and, as a result of such cessation of operations, more than 20% of the total number of the employer's employees who are participants under a plan established and maintained by the employer are separated from employment, the PBGC will determine the amount of liability under section 4063(b) of ERISA to be the amount described in section 4062 of ERISA for the entire plan, as if the plan had been terminated by the PBGC immediately after the date of the cessation of operations, multiplied by a fraction—
(1) The numerator of which is the number of the employer's employees who are participants under the plan and are separated from employment as
a result of the cessation of operations; and
(2) The denominator of which is the total number of the employer's current employees, as determined immediately before the cessation of operations, who are participants under the plan.
(b)
Example.
Company X sponsors a pension plan with 50,000 participants of which 20,000 are current employees and 30,000 are retirees or deferred vested participants. On a PBGC termination basis, the plan is underfunded by $80 million. Company X ceases operations at a facility resulting in the separation from employment of 5,000 employees, all of whom are participants in the pension plan. A section 4062(e) event has occurred, and the PBGC will determine the amount of employer liability under section 4063(b) of ERISA. The numerator described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is 5,000 and the denominator described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is 20,000. Therefore, the amount of liability under section 4063(b) of ERISA pursuant to section 4062(e) is $20 million (5,000/20,000 × $80 million).
[71 FR 34822, June 16, 2006]
§ 4062.9
Arrangements for satisfying liability.
(a)
General.
The PBGC will defer payment, or agree to other arrangements for the satisfaction, of any portion of liability to the PBGC only when—
(1) As provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the PBGC determines that such action is necessary to avoid the imposition of a severe hardship and that there is a reasonable possibility that the terms so prescribed will be met and the entire liability paid; or
(2) As provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the PBGC determines that section 4062(b) liability exceeds 30 percent of the collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination.
(b)
Upon request.
If the PBGC determines that such action is necessary to avoid the imposition of a severe hardship on persons that are or may become liable under section 4062, 4063, or 4064 of ERISA and that there is a reasonable possibility that persons so liable will be able to meet the terms prescribed and pay the entire liability, the PBGC, in its discretion and when so requested in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, may grant deferred payment or other terms for the satisfaction of such liability.
(1) In determining what, if any, terms to grant, the PBGC shall examine the following factors:
(i) The ratio of the liability to the net worth of the person making the request and (if different) to the collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination.
(ii) The overall financial condition of persons that are or may become liable, including, with respect to each such person—
(A) The amounts and terms of existing debts;
(B) The amount and availability of liquid assets;
(C) Current and past cash flow; and
(D) Projected cash flow, including a projection of the impact on operations that would be caused by the immediate full payment of the liability.
(iii) The availability of credit from private sector sources to the person making the request and to other liable persons.
(2) A contributing sponsor or member of a contributing sponsor's controlled group may request deferred payment or other terms for the satisfaction of any portion of the liability under section 4062, 4063, or 4064 of ERISA at any time by filing a written request. The request must include the information specified in § 4062.6(b), except that—
(i) If the request is filed one year or more after the net worth record date, references to “the net worth record date” in § 4062.6(b) shall be replaced by “the most recent annual anniversary of the net worth record date”; and
(ii) Information that already has been submitted to the PBGC need not be submitted again.
(c)
Liability exceeding 30 percent of collective net worth.
If the PBGC determines that section 4062(b) liability exceeds 30 percent of the collective net worth of persons subject to the liability, the PBGC will, after making a reasonable effort to reach agreement with such persons, prescribe commercially reasonable terms for payment of so
much of the liability as exceeds 30 percent of the collective net worth of such persons. The terms prescribed by the PBGC for payment of that portion of the liability (including interest) will provide for deferral of 50 percent of any amount otherwise payable for any year if a person subject to such liability demonstrates to the satisfaction of the PBGC that no person subject to such liability has any individual pre-tax profits (within the meaning of section 4062(d)(2) of ERISA) for such person's last full fiscal year ending during that year.
(d)
Interest.
Interest on unpaid liability is calculated in accordance with § 4062.7(a).
(e)
Security during period of deferred payment.
As a condition to the granting of deferred payment terms, PBGC may, in its discretion, require that the liable person(s) provide PBGC with such security for its obligations as the PBGC deems adequate.

Definitions.
The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: ERISA, PBGC, person, plan, and termination date.
Collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination
has the meaning in § 4062.2.
§ 4068.3
Notification of and demand for liability.
(a)
Notification of liability.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, when the PBGC has determined the amount of the liability under part 4062 and whether or not the liability has already been paid, the PBGC shall notify liable person(s) in writing of the amount of the liability. If the full liability has not yet been paid, the notification will include a request for payment of the full liability and will indicate that, as provided in § 4062.8, the PBGC will prescribe commercially reasonable terms for payment of so much of the liability as it determines exceeds 30 percent of the collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination. In all cases, the notification will include a statement of the right to appeal the assessment of liability pursuant to part 4003.
(b)
Demand for liability.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if person(s) liable to the PBGC fail to pay the full liability and no appeal is filed or an appeal is filed and the decision on appeal finds liability, the PBGC will issue a demand letter for the liability—
(1) If no appeal is filed, upon the expiration of time to file an appeal under part 4003; or
(2) If an appeal is filed, upon issuance of a decision on the appeal finding that there is liability under this part.
The demand letter will indicate that, as provided in § 4062.8, the PBGC will prescribe commercially reasonable terms for payment of so much of the liability as it determines exceeds 30 percent of the collective net worth of such persons.
(c)
Special rule.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the PBGC may, in any case in which it believes that its ability to assert or obtain payment of liability is in jeopardy, issue a demand letter for the liability under this part immediately upon determining the liability, without first issuing a notification of liability pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. When the PBGC issues a demand letter under this paragraph, there is no right to an appeal pursuant to part 4003 of this chapter.
§ 4068.4
Lien.
If any person liable to the PBGC under section 4062, 4063, or 4064 of ERISA fails or refuses to pay the full amount of such liability within the time specified in the demand letter issued under § 4068.3, the PBGC shall have a lien in the amount of the liability, including interest, arising as of the
plan's termination date, upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to that person, except that such lien may not be in an amount in excess of 30 percent of the collective net worth of all persons described in section 4062(a) of ERISA and part 4062 of this chapter.

(2) A copy of the executed amendment, including the proposed effective date.
(3) A statement certifying that notice of the adoption of the amendment and the request for approval filed under
this part has been given to all employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan and to all employee organizations representing employees covered under the plan.

# Subpart A—General
§ 4204.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
Under section 4204 of ERISA, an employer that ceases covered operations under a multiemployer plan, or ceases to have an obligation to contribute for such operations, because of a bona fide, arm's-length sale of assets to an unrelated purchaser does not incur withdrawal liability if certain conditions are met. One condition is that the sale contract provide that the seller will be secondarily liable if the purchaser withdraws from the plan within five years and does not pay its withdrawal liability. Another condition is that the purchaser furnish a bond or place funds in escrow, for a period of five plan years, in a prescribed amount. Section 4204 also authorizes the PBGC to provide for variances or exemptions from these requirements. Subpart B of this part provides variances and exemptions from the requirements for certain sales of assets. Subpart C of this part establishes procedures under which a purchaser or seller may, when the conditions set forth in subpart B are not satisfied or when the parties decline to provide certain financial information to the plan, request the PBGC to grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the requirements.
(b)
Scope.
In general, this part applies to any sale of assets described in section 4204(a)(1) of ERISA. However, this part does not apply to a sale of assets involving operations for which the seller is obligated to contribute to a plan described in section 404(c) of the Code, or a continuation of such a plan, unless the plan is amended to provide that section 4204 applies.
§ 4204.2
Definitions.
The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: Code, employer, ERISA, IRS, multiemployer plan, PBGC, person, plan, plan administrator, plan sponsor, and plan year.
In addition, for purposes of this part:
Date of determination
means the date on which a seller ceases covered operations or ceases to have an obligation to contribute for such operations as a result of a sale of assets within the meaning of section 4204(a) of ERISA.
Net income after taxes
means revenue minus expenses after taxes (excluding extraordinary and non-recurring income or expenses), as presented in an audited financial statement or, in the absence of such statement, in an unaudited financial statement, each prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Net tangible assets
means tangible assets (assets other than licenses, patents copyrights, trade names, trademarks, goodwill, experimental or organizational expenses, unamortized debt discounts and expenses and all other assets which, under generally accepted accounting principles, are deemed intangible) less liabilities (other than pension liabilities). Encumbered assets shall be excluded from net tangible assets only to the extent of the amount of the encumbrance.
Purchaser
means a purchaser described in section 4204(a)(1) of ERISA.
Seller
means a seller described in section 4204(a)(1) of ERISA.
Unfunded vested benefits
means, as described in section 4213(c) of ERISA, the amount by which the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan exceeds the value of the assets of the plan.
[61 FR 34084, July 1, 1996, as amended at 86 FR 1270, Jan. 8, 2021]

# Subpart B—Variance of the Statutory Requirements
§ 4204.11
Variance of the bond/escrow and sale-contract requirements.
(a)
General rule.
A purchaser's bond or escrow under section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA and the sale-contract provision under section 4204(a)(1)(C) are not required if the parties to the sale inform the plan in writing of their intention that the sale be covered by section 4204 of ERISA and demonstrate to the satisfaction of the plan that at least one of the criteria contained in § 4204.12 or § 4204.13(a) is satisfied.
(b)
Requests after posting of bond or establishment of escrow.
A request for a variance may be submitted at any time. If, after a purchaser has posted a
bond or placed money in escrow pursuant to section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, the purchaser demonstrates to the satisfaction of the plan that the criterion in either § 4204.13 (a)(1) or (a)(2) is satisfied, then the bond shall be cancelled or the amount in escrow shall be refunded. For purposes of considering a request after the bond or escrow is in place, the words “the year preceding the date of the variance request” shall be substituted for “the date of determination” for the first mention of that term in both § 4204.13 (a)(1) and (a)(2). In addition, in determining the purchaser's average net income after taxes under § 4204.13(a)(1), for any year included in the average for which the net income figure does not reflect the interest expense incurred with respect to the sale, the purchaser's net income shall be reduced by the amount of interest paid with respect to the sale in the fiscal year following the date of determination.
(c)
Information required.
A request for a variance shall contain financial or other information that is sufficient to establish that one of the criteria in § 4204.12 or § 4204.13(a) is satisfied. A request on the basis of either § 4204.13 (a)(1) or (a)(2) shall also include a copy of the purchaser's audited (if available) or (if not) unaudited financial statements for the specified time period.
(d)
Limited exemption during pendency of request.
Provided that all of the information required to be submitted is submitted before the first day of the first plan year beginning after the sale, a plan may not, pending its decision on the variance, require a purchaser to post a bond or place an amount in escrow pursuant to section 4204(a)(1)(B). In the event a bond or escrow is not in place pursuant to the preceding sentence, and the plan determines that the request does not qualify for a variance, the purchaser shall comply with section 4204(a)(1)(B) within 30 days after the date on which it receives notice of the plan's decision.
(e)
Method and date of issuance.
The PBGC applies the rules in subpart B of part 4000 of this chapter to determine permissible methods of issuance under this subpart. The PBGC applies the rules in subpart C of part 4000 of this chapter to determine the date that an issuance under this subpart was provided.

transactions.
The criterion under this section is that the amount of the bond or escrow does not exceed the lesser of $250,000 or two percent of the average total annual contributions made by all employers to the plan, for the purposes of section 304(b)(3)(A) of ERISA and section 431(b)(3)(A) of the Code, for the three most recent plan years ending before the date of determination.

§ 4204.13
Net income and net tangible assets tests.
(a)
General.
The criteria under this section are that either—
(1)
Net income test.
The purchaser's average net income after taxes for its three most recent fiscal years ending before the date of determination (as defined in § 4204.12), reduced by any interest expense incurred with respect to the sale which is payable in the fiscal year following the date of determination, equals or exceeds 150 percent of the amount of the bond or escrow required under ERISA section 4204(a)(1)(B); or
(2)
Net tangible assets test.
The purchaser's net tangible assets at the end of the fiscal year preceding the date of determination (as defined in § 4204.12), equal or exceed—
(i) If the purchaser was not obligated to contribute to the plan before the sale, the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to the seller under section 4211 (with respect to the purchased operations), as of the date of determination, or
(ii) If the purchaser was obligated to contribute to the plan before the sale, the sum of the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to the purchaser and to the seller under ERISA section 4211 (with respect to the purchased operations), each as of the date of determination.
(b)
Special rule when more than one plan is covered by request.
For the purposes of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), if the transaction involves the assumption by the purchaser of the seller's obligation to contribute to more than one multiemployer plan, then the total amount of the bond or escrow or of the unfunded vested benefits, as applicable, for all of the plans with respect to which the purchaser has not posted a bond or escrow shall be used to determine whether the applicable test is met.
(c)
Non-applicability of tests in event of purchaser's insolvency.
A purchaser will not qualify for a variance under this subpart pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section if, as of the earlier of the date of the plan's decision on the variance request or the first day of the first plan year beginning after the date of determination, the purchaser is the subject of a petition under title 11, United States Code, or of a proceeding under similar provisions of state insolvency laws.

§ 4206.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to prescribe rules, pursuant to section 4206(b) of ERISA, for adjusting the partial or complete withdrawal liability of an employer that previously partially withdrew from the same multiemployer plan. Section 4206(b)(1) provides that when an employer that has partially withdrawn from a plan subsequently incurs liability for another partial or a complete withdrawal from that plan, the employer's liability for the subsequent withdrawal is to be reduced by the amount of its liability for the prior partial withdrawal (less any waiver or reduction of that prior liability). Section 4206(b)(2) requires the PBGC to prescribe regulations adjusting the amount of this credit to ensure that the liability for the subsequent withdrawal properly reflects the employer's share of liability with respect to the plan. The purpose of the credit is to protect a withdrawing employer from being charged twice for the same unfunded vested benefits of the plan. The reduction in the credit protects
the other employers in the plan from becoming responsible for unfunded vested benefits properly allocable to the withdrawing employer. In the interests of simplicity, the rules in this part provide for, generally, a one-step calculation of the adjusted credit under section 4206(b)(2) against the subsequent liability, rather than for separate calculations first of the credit under section 4206(b)(1) and then of the reduction in the credit under paragraph (b)(2) of that section. In cases where the withdrawal liability for the prior partial withdrawal was reduced by an abatement or other reduction of that liability, the adjusted credit is further reduced in accordance with § 4206.8 of this part.
(b)
Scope.
This part applies to multiemployer plans covered under title IV of ERISA, and to employers that have partially withdrawn from such plans after September 25, 1980 and subsequently completely or partially withdraw from the same plan.
§ 4206.2
Definitions.
The following are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: Code, employer, ERISA, multiemployer plan, PBGC, plan, and plan year.
In addition, for purposes of this part:
Complete withdrawal
means a complete withdrawal as described in section 4203 of ERISA.
Partial withdrawal
means a partial withdrawal as described in section 4205 of ERISA.
Unfunded vested benefits
means, as described in section 4213(c) of ERISA, the amount by which the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan exceeds the value of the assets of the plan.
[61 FR 34086, July 1, 1996, as amended at 86 FR 1270, Jan. 8, 2021]
§ 4206.3
Credit against liability for a subsequent withdrawal.
Whenever an employer that was assessed withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal from a plan partially or completely withdraws from that plan in a subsequent plan year, it shall receive a credit against the new withdrawal liability in an amount greater than or equal to zero, determined in accordance with this part. If the credit determined under §§ 4206.4 through 4206.9 is less than zero, the amount of the credit shall equal zero.
§ 4206.4
Amount of credit in plans using the presumptive method.
(a)
General.
In a plan that uses the presumptive allocation method described in section 4211(b) of ERISA, the credit shall equal the sum of the unamortized old liabilities determined under paragraph (b) of this section, multiplied by the fractions described or determined under paragraph (c) of this section. When an employer's prior partial withdrawal liability has been reduced or waived, this credit shall be adjusted in accordance with § 4206.8.
(b)
Unamortized old liabilities.
The amounts determined under this paragraph are the employer's proportional shares, if any, of the unamortized amounts as of the end of the plan year preceding the withdrawal for which the credit is being calculated, of—
(1) The plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the last plan year ending before September 26, 1980;
(2) The annual changes in the plan's unfunded vested benefits for plan years ending after September 25, 1980, and before the year of the prior partial withdrawal; and
(3) The reallocated unfunded vested benefits (if any), as determined under section 4211(b)(4) of ERISA, for plan years ending before the year of the prior partial withdrawal.
(c)
Employer's allocable share of old liabilities.
The sum of the amounts determined under paragraph (b) are multiplied by the two fractions described in this paragraph in order to determine the amount of the old liabilities that was previously assessed against the employer.
(1) The first fraction is the fraction determined under section 4206(a)(2) of ERISA for the prior partial withdrawal.
(2) The second fraction is a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the liability assessed against the employer for the prior partial withdrawal, and the denominator of which is the product of—
(i) The amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer as if it had completely withdrawn as of the
date of the prior partial withdrawal (determined without regard to any adjustments), multiplied by—
(ii) The fraction determined under section 4206(a)(2) of ERISA for the prior partial withdrawal.
§ 4206.5
Amount of credit in plans using the modified presumptive method.
(a)
General.
In a plan that uses the modified presumptive method described in section 4211(c)(2) of ERISA, the credit shall equal the sum of the unamortized old liabilities determined under paragraph (b) of this section, multiplied by the fractions described or determined under paragraph (c) of this section. When an employer's prior partial withdrawal liability has been reduced or waived, this credit shall be adjusted in accordance with § 4206.8.
(b)
Unamortized old liabilities.
The amounts described in this paragraph shall be determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the withdrawal for which the credit is being calculated, and are the employer's proportional shares, if any, of—
(1) The plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the last plan year ending before September 26, 1980, reduced as if those obligations were being fully amortized in level annual installments over 15 years beginning with the first plan year ending on or after such date; and
(2) The aggregate post-1980 change amount determined under section 4211(c)(2)(C) of ERISA as if the employer had completely withdrawn in the year of the prior partial withdrawal, reduced as if those obligations were being fully amortized in level annual installments over the 5-year period beginning with the plan year in which the prior partial withdrawal occurred.
(c)
Employer's allocable share of old liabilities.
The sum of the amounts determined under paragraph (b) are multiplied by the two fractions described in this paragraph in order to determine the amount of old liabilities that was previously assessed against the employer.
(1) The first fraction is the fraction determined under section 4206(a)(2) of ERISA for the prior partial withdrawal.
(2) The second fraction is a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the liability assessed against the employer for the prior partial withdrawal, and the denominator of which is the product of—
(i) The amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer as if it had completely withdrawn as of the date of the prior partial withdrawal (determined without regard to any adjustments), multiplied by—
(ii) The fraction determined under section 4206(a)(2) of ERISA for the prior partial withdrawal.
§ 4206.6
Amount of credit in plans using the rolling-5 method.
In a plan that uses the rolling-5 allocation method described in section 4211(c)(3) of ERISA, the credit shall equal the amount of the liability assessed for the prior partial withdrawal, reduced as if that amount was being fully amortized in level annual installments over the 5-year period beginning with the plan year in which the prior partial withdrawal occurred. When an employer's prior partial withdrawal liability has been reduced or waived, this credit shall be adjusted in accordance with § 4206.8.
§ 4206.7
Amount of credit in plans using the direct attribution method.
In a plan that uses the direct attribution allocation method described in section 4211(c)(4) of ERISA, the credit shall equal the amount of the liability assessed for the prior partial withdrawal, reduced as if that amount was being fully amortized in level annual installments beginning with the plan year in which the prior partial withdrawal occurred, over the greater of 10 years or the amortization period for the resulting base when the combined charge base and the combined credit base are offset under section 431(b)(5) of the Code. When an employer's prior partial withdrawal liability has been reduced or waived, this credit shall be adjusted in accordance with § 4206.8.
[61 FR 34086, July 1, 1996, as amended at 80 FR 55009, Sept. 11, 2015]
§ 4206.8
Reduction of credit for abatement or other reduction of prior partial withdrawal liability.
(a)
General.
If an employer's withdrawal liability for a prior partial withdrawal has been reduced or waived, the credit determined pursuant to §§ 4206.4 through 4206.7 shall be adjusted in accordance with this section.
(b)
Computation.
The adjusted credit is calculated by multiplying the credit determined under the preceding sections of this part by a fraction—
(1) The numerator of which is the excess of the total partial withdrawal liability of the employer for all partial withdrawals in prior years (excluding those partial withdrawals for which the credit is zero) over the present value of each abatement or other reduction of that prior withdrawal liability calculated as of the date on which that prior partial withdrawal liability was determined; and
(2) The denominator of which is the total partial withdrawal liability of the employer for all partial withdrawals in prior years (excluding those partial withdrawals for which the credit is zero).
§ 4206.9
Amount of credit in plans using alternative allocation methods.
A plan that has adopted an alternative method of allocating unfunded vested benefits pursuant to section 4211(c)(5) of ERISA and part 4211 of this chapter shall adopt, by plan amendment, a method of calculating the credit provided by § 4206.3 that is consistent with the rules in §§ 4206.4 through 4206.8 for plans using the statutory allocation method most similar to the plan's alternative allocation method.
§ 4206.10
Special rule for 70-percent decline partial withdrawals.
For the purposes of applying the rules in §§ 4206.4 through 4206.9 in any case in which either the prior or subsequent partial withdrawal resulted from a 70-percent contribution decline (or a 35-percent decline in the case of certain retail food industry plans), the first year of the 3-year testing period shall be deemed to be the plan year in which the partial withdrawal occurred.

§ 4207.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to prescribe rules, pursuant to section 4207(a) of ERISA, for reducing or waiving the withdrawal liability of certain employers that have completely withdrawn from a multiemployer plan and subsequently resume covered operations under the plan. This part prescribes rules pursuant to which the plan must waive the employer's obligation to make future liability payments with respect to its complete withdrawal and must calculate the amount of the employer's liability for a partial or complete withdrawal from the plan after its reentry into the plan. This part also provides procedures, pursuant to section 4207(b) of ERISA, for plan sponsors of multiemployer plans to apply to PBGC for approval of plan amendments that provide for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability under conditions other than those specified in section 4207(a) of ERISA and this part.
(b)
Scope.
This part applies to multiemployer plans covered under title IV of ERISA, and to employers that have completely withdrawn from such plans after September 25, 1980, and that have not, as of the date of their reentry into the plan, fully satisfied their obligation to pay withdrawal liability arising from the complete withdrawal.
§ 4207.2
Definitions.

(1) A restoration involving a mere change in identity, form or place of organization, however effected;
(2) A reorganization involving a liquidation into a parent corporation;
(3) A merger, consolidation or division solely between (or among) trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated) of the employer; or
(4) An acquisition by or of, or a merger or combination with another trade or business.
Partial withdrawal
means a partial withdrawal as described in section 4205 of ERISA.
Period of withdrawal
means the plan year in which the employer completely withdrew from the plan, the plan year in which the employer reentered the plan and all intervening plan years.

[61 FR 34088, July 1, 1996, as amended at 86 FR 1270, Jan. 8, 2021]
§ 4207.3
Abatement.
(a)
General.
Whenever an eligible employer that has completely withdrawn from a multiemployer plan reenters the plan, it may apply to the plan for abatement of its complete withdrawal liability. Applications shall be filed by the date of the first scheduled withdrawal liability payment falling due after the employer resumes covered operations or, if later, the fifteenth calendar day after the employer resumes covered operations. Applications shall identify the eligible employer, the withdrawn employer, if different, the date of withdrawal, and the date of resumption of covered operations. Upon receiving an application for abatement, the plan sponsor shall determine, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, whether the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its complete withdrawal liability under § 4207.5, § 4207.9, or a plan amendment which has been approved by PBGC pursuant to § 4207.10. If the plan sponsor determines that the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its complete withdrawal liability, the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply. If the plan sponsor determines that the employer does not satisfy the requirements for abatement of its complete withdrawal liability, the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall apply.
(b)
Determination of abatement.
As soon as practicable after an eligible employer that completely withdrew from a multiemployer plan applies for abatement, the plan sponsor shall determine whether the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its complete withdrawal liability under this part and shall notify the employer in writing of its determination and of the consequences of its determination, as described in paragraphs (c) or (d) and (e) of this section, as appropriate. If a bond or escrow has been provided to the plan under § 4207.4, the plan sponsor shall send a copy of the notice to the bonding or escrow agent.
(c)
Effects of abatement.
If the plan sponsor determines that the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its complete withdrawal liability under this part, then—
(1) The employer shall have no obligation to make future withdrawal liability payments to the plan with respect to its complete withdrawal;
(2) The employer's liability for a subsequent withdrawal shall be determined in accordance with § 4207.7 or § 4207.8, as applicable;
(3) Any bonds furnished under § 4207.4 shall be cancelled and any amounts held in escrow under § 4207.4 shall be refunded to the employer; and
(4) Any withdrawal liability payments due after the reentry and made by the employer to the plan shall be refunded by the plan without interest.
(d)
Effects of non-abatement.
If the plan sponsor determines that the employer does not satisfy the requirements for abatement of its complete withdrawal liability under this part, then—
(1) The bond or escrow furnished under § 4207.4 shall be paid to the plan within 30 days after the date of the plan sponsor's notice under paragraph (b) of this section;
(2) The employer shall pay to the plan within 30 days after the date of the plan sponsor's notice under paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of its withdrawal liability payment or payments, with respect to which the bond or escrow was furnished, in excess of the bond or escrow;
(3) The employer shall resume making its withdrawal liability payments as they are due to the plan; and
(4) The employer shall be treated as a new employer for purposes of any future application of the withdrawal liability rules in sections 4201-4225 of title IV of ERISA with respect to its participation in the plan after its reentry into the plan, except that in plans using the “direct attribution” method (section 4211(c)(4) of ERISA), the nonforfeitable benefits attributable to service with the employer shall include nonforfeitable benefits attributable to service prior to reentry that were not nonforfeitable at that time.
(e)
Collection of payments due and review of non-abatement determination.
The rules in part 4219, subpart C, of this chapter (relating to overdue, defaulted, and overpaid withdrawal liability) shall apply with respect to all payments required to be made under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. For this purpose, a payment required to be made under paragraph (d)(2) shall be treated as a withdrawal liability payment due on the 30th day after the date of the plan sponsor's notice under paragraph (b) of this section.
(1)
Review of non-abatement determination.
A plan sponsor's determination that the employer does not satisfy the requirements for abatement under this part shall be subject to plan review under section 4219(b)(2) of ERISA and to arbitration under section 4221 of ERISA, within the times prescribed by those sections. For this purpose, the plan sponsor's notice under paragraph (b) of this section shall be treated as a demand under section 4219(b)(1) of ERISA.
(2)
Determination of abatement.
If the plan sponsor or an arbitrator determines that the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its complete withdrawal liability under this part, the plan sponsor shall immediately refund the following payments (plus interest, except as indicated below, determined in accordance with § 4219.31(d) of this chapter as if the payments were overpayments of withdrawal liability) to the employer in a lump sum:
(i) The amount of the employer's withdrawal liability payment or payments, without interest, due after its reentry and made by the employer.
(ii) The bond or escrow paid to the plan under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(iii) The amount of the employer's withdrawal liability payment or payments in excess of the bond or escrow, paid to the plan under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(iv) Any withdrawal liability payment made by the employer to the plan pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section after the plan sponsor's notice under paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 4207.4
Withdrawal liability payments during pendency of abatement determination.
(a)
General rule.
An eligible employer that completely withdraws from a multiemployer plan and subsequently reenters the plan may, in lieu of making withdrawal liability payments due after its reentry, provide a bond to, or establish an escrow account for, the plan that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section or any plan rules adopted under paragraph (d) of this section, pending a determination by the plan sponsor under § 4207.3(b) of whether the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its complete withdrawal liability.
An employer that applies for abatement and neither provides a bond/escrow nor pays its withdrawal liability payments remains eligible for abatement.
(b)
Bond/escrow.
The bond or escrow allowed by this section shall be in an amount equal to 70 percent of the withdrawal liability payments that would otherwise be due. The bond or escrow relating to each payment shall be furnished before the due date of that payment. A single bond or escrow may be provided for more than one payment due during the pendency of the plan sponsor's determination. The bond or escrow agreement shall provide that if the plan sponsor determines that the employer does not satisfy the requirements for abatement of its complete withdrawal liability under this part, the bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan upon notice from the plan sponsor to the bonding or escrow agent. A bond provided under this paragraph shall be issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 412 of ERISA.
(c)
Notice of bond/escrow.
Concurrently with posting a bond or establishing an escrow account under paragraph (b) of this section, the employer shall notify the plan sponsor. The notice shall include a statement of the amount of the bond or escrow, the scheduled payment or payments with respect to which the bond or escrow is being furnished, and the name and address of the bonding or escrow agent.
(d)
Plan amendments concerning bond/escrow.
A plan may, by amendment, adopt rules decreasing the amount specified in paragraph (b) of a bond or escrow allowed under this section. A plan amendment adopted under this paragraph may be applied only to the extent that it is consistent with the purposes of ERISA.
§ 4207.5
Requirements for abatement.
(a)
General rule.
Except as provided in § 4207.9 (d) and (e) (pertaining to acquisitions, mergers and other combinations), an eligible employer that completely withdraws from a multiemployer plan and subsequently reenters the plan shall have its liability for that withdrawal abated in accordance with § 4207.3(c) if the employer resumes covered operations under the plan, and the number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer has an obligation to contribute under the plan for the measurement period (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) after it resumes covered operations exceeds 30 percent of the number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the base year (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section).
(b)
Measurement period.
If the employer resumes covered operations under the plan at least six full months prior to the end of a plan year and would satisfy the test in paragraph (a) based on its contribution base units for that plan year, then the measurement period shall be the period from the date it resumes covered operations until the end of that plan year. If the employer would not satisfy this test, or if the employer resumes covered operations under the plan less than six full months prior to the end of the plan year, the measurement period shall be the first twelve months after it resumes covered operations.
(c)
Base year.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the employer's number of contribution base units for the base year is the average number of contribution base units for the two plan years in which its contribution base units were the highest, within the five plan years immediately preceding the year of its complete withdrawal.
§ 4207.6
Partial withdrawals after reentry.
(a)
General rule.
For purposes of determining whether there is a partial withdrawal of an eligible employer whose liability is abated under this part upon the employer's reentry into the plan or at any time thereafter, the plan sponsor shall apply the rules in section 4205 of ERISA, as modified by the rules in this section, and section 108 of the Multiemployer Act. A partial withdrawal of an employer whose liability is abated under this part may occur under these rules upon the employer's reentry into the plan. However, a plan sponsor may not demand payment of withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal occurring upon the
employer's reentry before the plan sponsor has determined that the employer's liability for its complete withdrawal is abated under this part and has so notified the employer in accordance with § 4207.3(b).
(b)
Partial withdrawal—70-percent contribution decline.
The plan sponsor shall determine whether there is a partial withdrawal described in section 4205(a)(1) of ERISA (relating to a 70-percent contribution decline) in accordance with the rules in section 4205 of ERISA and section 108 of the Multiemployer Act, as modified by the rules in this paragraph, and shall determine the amount of an employer's liability for that partial withdrawal in accordance with the rules in § 4207.8(b).
(1)
Definition of “3-year testing period.
” For purposes of section 4205(b)(1) of ERISA, the term “3-year testing period” means the period consisting of the plan year for which the determination is made and the two immediately preceding plan years, excluding any plan year during the period of withdrawal.
(2)
Contribution base units for high base year.
For purposes of section 4205(b)(1) of ERISA and except as provided in section 108(d)(3) of the Multiemployer Act, in determining the number of contribution base units for the high base year, if the five plan years immediately preceding the beginning of the 3-year testing period include a plan year during the period of withdrawal, the number of contribution base units for each such year of withdrawal shall be deemed to be the greater of—
(i) The employer's contribution base units for that plan year; or
(ii) The average of the employer's contribution base units for the three plan years preceding the plan year in which the employer completely withdrew from the plan.
(c)
Partial withdrawal—partial cessation of contribution obligation.
The plan sponsor shall determine whether there is a partial withdrawal described in section 4205(a)(2) of ERISA (relating to a partial cessation of the employer's contribution obligation) in accordance with the rules in section 4205 of ERISA, as modified by the rules in this paragraph, and section 108 of the Multiemployer Act. In making this determination, the sponsor shall exclude all plan years during the period of withdrawal. A partial withdrawal under this paragraph can occur no earlier than the plan year of reentry. If the sponsor determines that there was a partial withdrawal, it shall determine the amount of an employer's liability for that partial withdrawal in accordance with the rules in § 4207.8(c).
§ 4207.7
Liability for subsequent complete withdrawals and related adjustments for allocating unfunded vested benefits.
(a)
General.
When an eligible employer that has had its liability for a complete withdrawal abated under this part completely withdraws from the plan, the employer's liability for that subsequent withdrawal shall be determined in accordance with the rules in sections 4201-4225 of title IV, as modified by the rules in this section, and section 108 of the Multiemployer Act. In the case of a combination described in § 4207.9(d), the modifications described in this section shall be applied only with respect to that portion of the eligible employer that had previously withdrawn from the plan. In the case of a combination described in § 4207.9(e), the modifications shall be applied separately with respect to each previously withdrawn employer that comprises the eligible employer. In addition, when a plan has abated the liability of a reentered employer, if the plan uses either the “presumptive” or the “direct attribution” method (section 4211(b) or (c)(4), respectively) for allocating unfunded vested benefits, the plan shall modify those allocation methods as described in this section in allocating unfunded vested benefits to any employer that withdraws from the plan after the reentry.
(b)
Allocation of unfunded vested benefits for subsequent withdrawal in plans using “presumptive” method.
In a plan using the “presumptive” allocation method under section 4211(b) of ERISA, the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to a reentered employer for a subsequent withdrawal shall equal the sum of—
(1) The unamortized amount of the employer's allocable shares of the amounts described in section 4211(b)(1),
for the plan years preceding the initial withdrawal, determined as if the employer had not previously withdrawn;
(2) The sum of the unamortized annual credits attributable to the year of the initial withdrawal and each succeeding year ending prior to reentry; and
(3) The unamortized amount of the employer's allocable shares of the amounts described in section 4211(b)(1)(A) and (C) for plan years ending after its reentry. For purposes of paragraph (b)(2), the annual credit for a plan year is the amount by which the employer's withdrawal liability payments for the year exceed the greater of the employer's imputed contributions or actual contributions for the year. The employer's imputed contributions for a year shall equal the average annual required contributions of the employer for the three plan years preceding the initial withdrawal. The amount of the credit for a plan year is reduced by 5 percent of the original amount for each succeeding plan year ending prior to the year of the subsequent withdrawal.
(c)
Allocation of unfunded vested benefits for subsequent withdrawal in plans using “modified presumptive” or “rolling-5” method.
In a plan using either the “modified presumptive” allocation method under section 4211(c)(2) of ERISA or the “rolling-5” method under section 4211(c)(3), the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to a reentered employer for a subsequent withdrawal shall equal the sum of—
(1) The amount determined under section 4211 (c)(2) or (c)(3) of ERISA, as appropriate, as if the date of reentry were the employer's initial date of participation in the plan; and
(2) The outstanding balance, as of the date of reentry, of the unfunded vested benefits allocated to the employer for its previous withdrawal (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) reduced as if that amount were being fully amortized in level annual installments, at the plan's funding rate as of the date of reentry, over the period described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii), beginning with the first plan year after reentry.
(i) The outstanding balance of the unfunded vested benefits allocated to an employer for its previous withdrawal is the excess of the amount determined under section 4211 (c)(2) or (c)(3) of ERISA as of the end of the plan year in which the employer initially withdrew, accumulated with interest at the plan's funding rate for that year, from that year to the date of reentry, over the withdrawal liability payments made by the employer, accumulated with interest from the date of payment to the date of reentry at the plan's funding rate for the year of entry.
(ii) The period referred to in paragraph (c)(2) for plans using the modified presumptive method is the greater of five years, or the number of full plan years remaining on the amortization schedule under section 4211(c)(2)(B)(i) of ERISA. For plans using the rolling-5 method, the period is five years.
(d)
Adjustments applicable to all employers in plans using “presumptive” method.
In a plan using the “presumptive” allocation method under section 4211(b) of ERISA, when the plan has abated the withdrawal liability of a reentered employer pursuant to this part, the following adjustments to the allocation method shall be made in computing the unfunded vested benefits allocable to any employer that withdraws from the plan in a plan year beginning after the reentry:
(1) The sum of the unamortized amounts of the annual credits of a reentered employer shall be treated as a reallocated amount under section 4211(b)(4) of ERISA in the plan year in which the employer reenters.
(2) In the event that the 5-year period used to compute the denominator of the fraction described in section 4211 (b)(2)(E) and (b)(4)(D) of ERISA includes a year during the period of withdrawal of a reentered employer, the contributions for a year during the period of withdrawal shall be adjusted to include any actual or imputed contributions of the employer, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section.
(e)
Adjustments applicable to all employers in plans using “direct attribution” method.
In a plan using the “direct attribution” method under section 4211(c)(4) of ERISA, when the plan has abated the withdrawal liability of a reentered employer pursuant to this
part, the following adjustments to the allocation method shall be made in computing the unfunded vested benefits allocable to any employer that withdraws from the plan in a plan year beginning after the reentry:
(1) The nonforfeitable benefits attributable to service with a reentered employer prior to its initial withdrawal shall be treated as benefits that are attributable to service with that employer.
(2) For purposes of section 4211(c)(4)(D)(ii) and (iii) of ERISA, withdrawal liability payments made by a reentered employer shall be treated as contributions made by the reentered employer.
(f)
Plans using alternative allocation methods under section 4211(c)(5).
A plan that has adopted an alternative method of allocating unfunded vested benefits pursuant to section 4211(c)(5) of ERISA and part 4211 of this chapter shall adopt by plan amendment a method of determining a reentered employer's allocable share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits upon its subsequent withdrawal. The method shall treat the reentered employer and other withdrawing employers in a manner consistent with the treatment under the paragraph(s) of this section applicable to plans using the statutory allocation method most similar to the plan's alternative allocation method.
(g)
Adjustments to amount of annual withdrawal liability payments for subsequent withdrawal.
For purposes of section 4219(c)(1)(C)(i)(I) and (ii)(I) of ERISA, in determining the amount of the annual withdrawal liability payments for a subsequent complete withdrawal, if the period of ten consecutive plan years ending before the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs includes a plan year during the period of withdrawal, the employer's number of contribution base units, used in section 4219(c)(1)(C)(i)(I), or the required employer contributions, used in section 4219(c)(1)(C)(ii)(I), for each such plan year during the period of withdrawal shall be deemed to be the greater of—
(1) The employer's contribution base units or the required employer contributions, as applicable, for that year; or
(2) The average of the employer's contribution base units or of the required employer contributions, as applicable, for those plan years not during the period of withdrawal, within the ten consecutive plan years ending before the plan year in which the employer's subsequent complete withdrawal occurred.
§ 4207.8
Liability for subsequent partial withdrawals.
(a)
General.
When an eligible employer that has had its liability for a complete withdrawal abated under this part partially withdraws from the plan, the employer's liability for that subsequent partial withdrawal shall be determined in accordance with the rules in sections 4201-4225 of ERISA, as modified by the rules in § 4207.7 (b) through (g) of this part and the rules in this section, and section 108 of the Multiemployer Act.
(b)
Liability for a 70-percent contribution decline.
The amount of an employer's liability under section 4206(a) (relating to the calculation of liability for a partial withdrawal), section 4208 (relating to the reduction of liability for a partial withdrawal) and section 4219(c)(1) (relating to the schedule of partial withdrawal liability payments) of ERISA, for a subsequent partial withdrawal described in section 4205(a)(1) of ERISA (relating to a 70-percent contribution decline) shall be modified in accordance with the rules in this paragraph.
(1)
Definition of “3-year testing period.
” For purposes of sections 4206(a) and 4219(c)(1) of ERISA, and paragraphs (b)(2)-(b)(4) of this section, the term “3-year testing period” means the period consisting of the plan year for which the determination is made and the two immediately preceding plan years, excluding any plan year during the period of withdrawal.
(2)
Determination date of section 4211 allocable share.
For purposes of section 4206(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, the amount determined under section 4211 shall be determined as if the employer had withdrawn from the plan in a complete withdrawal on the last day of the first plan year in the 3-year testing period or the last day of the plan year in
which the employer reentered the plan, whichever is later.
(3)
Calculation of fractional share of section 4211 amount.
For purposes of sections 4206(a)(2)(B)(ii) and 4219(c)(1)(E)(ii) of ERISA, if the five plan years immediately preceding the beginning of the 3-year testing period include a plan year during the period of withdrawal, then, in determining the denominator of the fraction described in section 4206(a)(2), the employer's contribution base units for each such year of withdrawal shall be deemed to be the greater of—
(i) The employer's contribution base units for that plan year; or
(ii) The average of the employer's contribution base units for the three plan years preceding the plan year in which the employer completely withdrew from the plan.
(4)
Contribution base units for high base year.
If the five plan years immediately preceding the beginning of the 3-year testing period include a plan year during the period of withdrawal, then for purposes of section 4208 (a) and (b)(1) of ERISA, the number of contribution base units for the high base year shall be the number of contribution base units determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(c)
Liability for partial cessation of contribution obligation.
The amount of an employer's liability under section 4206(a) (relating to the calculation of liability for a partial withdrawal) and section 4219(c)(1) (relating to the amount of the annual partial withdrawal liability payments) of ERISA, for a subsequent partial withdrawal described in section 4205(a)(2) of ERISA (relating to a partial cessation of the contribution obligation) shall be modified in accordance with the rules in this paragraph. For purposes of sections 4206(a)(2)(B)(i) and 4219(c)(1)(E)(ii) of ERISA, if the five plan years immediately preceding the plan year in which the partial withdrawal occurs include a plan year during the period of withdrawal, the denominator of the fraction described in section 4206(a)(2) shall be determined in accordance with the rule set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
§ 4207.9
Special rules.
(a)
Employer that has withdrawn and reentered the plan before the effective date of this part.
This part shall apply, in accordance with the rules in this paragraph, with respect to an eligible employer that completely withdraws from a multiemployer plan after September 25, 1980, and is performing covered work under the plan on the effective date of this part. Upon the application of an employer described in the preceding sentence, the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan shall determine whether the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its complete withdrawal liability under this part. Pending the plan sponsor's determination, the employer may provide the plan with a bond or escrow that satisfies the requirements of § 4207.4, in lieu of making its withdrawal liability payments due after its application for an abatement determination. The plan sponsor shall notify the employer in writing of its determination and the consequences of its determination as described in § 4207.3 (c) or (d) and (e), as applicable. If the plan sponsor determines that the employer qualifies for abatement, only withdrawal liability payments made prior to the employer's reentry shall be retained by the plan; payments made by the employer after its reentry shall be refunded to the employer, with interest on those made prior to the application for abatement, in accordance with § 4207.3(e)(2). If a bond or escrow has been provided to the plan in accordance with § 4207.4, the plan sponsor shall send a copy of the notice to the bonding or escrow agent. Sections 4207.6 through 4207.8 shall apply with respect to the employer's subsequent complete withdrawal occurring on or after the effective date of this part, or partial withdrawal occurring either before or after that date. This paragraph shall not negate reasonable actions taken by plans prior to the effective date of this part under plan rules implementing section 4207(a) of ERISA that were validly adopted pursuant to section 405 of the Multiemployer Act.
(b)
Employer with multiple complete withdrawals that has reentered the plan before effective date of this part.
If an employer described in paragraph (a) of
this section has completely withdrawn from a multiemployer plan on two or more occasions before the effective date of this part, the rules in paragraph (a) of this section shall be applied as modified by this paragraph.
(1) The plan sponsor shall determine whether the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement under § 4207.5 based on the most recent complete withdrawal.
(2) If the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement, the employer's liability with respect to all previous complete withdrawals shall be abated.
(3) If the liability is abated, §§ 4207.6 and 4207.7 shall be applied as if the employer's earliest complete withdrawal were its initial complete withdrawal.
(c)
Employer with multiple complete withdrawals that has not reentered the plan as of the effective date of this part.
If an eligible employer has completely withdrawn from a multiemployer plan on two or more occasions between September 26, 1980, and the effective date of this part and is not performing covered work under the plan on the effective date of this regulation, the rules in this part shall apply, subject to the modifications specified in paragraphs (b)(1)-(b)(3) of this section, upon the employer's reentry into the plan.
(d)
Combination of withdrawn employer with contributing employer.
If a withdrawn employer merges or otherwise combines with an employer that has an obligation to contribute to the plan from which the first employer withdrew, the combined entity is the eligible employer, and the rules of § 4207.5 shall be applied—
(1) By subtracting from the measurement period contribution base units the contribution base units for which the non-withdrawn portion of the employer was obligated to contribute in the last plan year ending prior to the combination;
(2) By determining the base year contribution base units solely by reference to the contribution base units of the withdrawn portion of the employer; and
(3) By using the date of the combination, rather than the date of resumption of covered operations, to begin the measurement period.
(e)
Combination of two or more withdrawn employers.
If two or more withdrawn employers merge or otherwise combine, the combined entity is the eligible employer, and the rules of § 4207.5 shall be applied by combining the number of contribution base units with respect to which each portion of the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan for its base year. However, the combined number of contribution base units shall not include contribution base units of a withdrawn portion of the employer that had fully paid its withdrawal liability as of the date of the resumption of covered operations.
§ 4207.10
Plan rules for abatement.
(a)
General rule.
Subject to the approval of the PBGC, a plan may, by amendment, adopt rules for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability under conditions other than those specified in §§ 4207.5 and 4207.9 (c) and (d), provided that such conditions relate to events occurring or factors existing subsequent to a complete withdrawal year. The request for PBGC approval shall be filed after the amendment is adopted. A plan amendment under this section may not be put into effect until it is approved by the PBGC. However, an amendment that is approved by the PBGC may apply retroactively to the date of the adoption of the amendment. PBGC approval shall also be required for any subsequent modification of the amendment, other than repeal of the amendment. Sections 4207.6, 4207.7, and 4207.8 shall apply to all subsequent partial withdrawals after a reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability under a plan amendment approved by the PBGC pursuant to this section.
(b)
Who may request.
The plan sponsor, or a duly authorized representative acting on behalf of the plan sponsor, shall sign and submit the request.
(c)
Where to file.
See § 4000.4 of this chapter for information on where to file.
(d)
Information.
Each request shall contain the following information:
(1) The name and address of the plan for which the plan amendment is being submitted and the telephone number of
the plan sponsor or its duly authorized representative.
(2) The nine-digit Employer Identification Number (EIN) assigned to the plan sponsor by the IRS and the three-digit Plan Identification Number (PN) assigned to the plan by the plan sponsor, and, if different, the EIN and PN last filed with the PBGC. If no EIN or PN has been assigned, that should be indicated.
(3) A copy of the executed amendment, including—
(i) The date on which the amendment was adopted;
(ii) The proposed effective date; and
(iii) The full text of the rules on the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability.
(4) A copy of the most recent actuarial valuation report of the plan.
(5) A statement certifying that notice of the adoption of the amendment and of the request for approval filed under this section has been given to all employers that have an obligation to contribute under the plan and to all employee organizations representing employees covered under the plan.
(e)
Supplemental information.
In addition to the information described in paragraph (d) of this section, a plan may submit any other information that it believes it pertinent to its request. The PBGC may require the plan sponsor to submit any other information that the PBGC determines it needs to review a request under this section.
(f)
Criteria for PBGC approval.
The PBGC shall approve a plan amendment authorized by paragraph (a) of this section if it determines that the rules therein are consistent with the purposes of ERISA. An abatement rule is not consistent with the purposes of ERISA if—
(1) Implementation of the rule would be adverse to the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries; or
(2) The rule would increase the PBGC's risk of loss with respect to the plan.

§ 4208.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to establish rules for reducing or waiving the liability of certain employers that have partially withdrawn from a multiemployer pension plan.
(b)
Scope.
This part applies to multiemployer pension plans covered under title IV of ERISA and to employers that have partially withdrawn from such plans after September 25, 1980, and that have not, as of the date on which they satisfy the conditions for reducing or eliminating their partial withdrawal
liability, fully satisfied their obligation to pay that partial withdrawal liability. This rule shall not negate reasonable actions taken by plans prior to the effective date of this part under plan rules implementing section 4208 of ERISA that were validly adopted pursuant to section 405 of the Multiemployer Act.
§ 4208.2
Definitions.
The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: employer, ERISA, IRS, Multiemployer Act, multiemployer plan, PBGC, plan, and plan year.
In addition, for purposes of this part:
Complete withdrawal
means a complete withdrawal as described in section 4203 of ERISA.
Eligible employer
means the employer, as defined in section 4001(b) of ERISA, as it existed on the date of its initial partial or complete withdrawal, as applicable. An eligible employer shall continue to be an eligible employer notwithstanding the occurrence of any of the following events:
(1) A restoration involving a mere change in identity, form or place of organization, however effected;
(2) A reorganization involving a liquidation into a parent corporation;
(3) A merger, consolidation or division solely between (or among) trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated) of the employer; or
(4) An acquisition by or of, or a merger or combination with another trade or business.
Partial withdrawal
means a partial withdrawal as described in section 4205 of ERISA.
Partial withdrawal year
means the third year of the 3-year testing period in the case of a partial withdrawal caused by a 70-percent contribution decline, or the year of the partial cessation in the case of a partial withdrawal caused by a partial cessation of the employer's contribution obligation.
§ 4208.3
Abatement.
(a)
General.
Whenever an eligible employer that has partially withdrawn from a multiemployer plan satisfies the requirements in § 4208.4 for the reduction or waiver of its partial withdrawal liability, it may apply to the plan for abatement of its partial withdrawal liability. Applications shall identify the eligible employer, the withdrawn employer (if different), the date of withdrawal, and the basis for reduction or waiver of its withdrawal liability. Upon receiving a complete application for abatement, the plan sponsor shall determine, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, whether the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its partial withdrawal liability under § 4208.4. If the plan sponsor determines that the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its partial withdrawal liability, the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply. If the plan sponsor determines that the employer does not satisfy the requirements for abatement of its partial withdrawal liability, the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall apply.
(b)
Determination of abatement.
Within 60 days after an eligible employer that partially withdrew from a multiemployer plan applies for abatement in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the plan sponsor shall determine whether the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its partial withdrawal liability under § 4208.4 and shall notify the employer in writing of its determination and of the consequences of its determination, as described in paragraphs (c) or (d) and (e) of this section, as appropriate. If a bond or escrow has been provided to the plan under § 4208.5 of this part, the plan sponsor shall send a copy of the notice to the bonding or escrow agent.
(c)
Effects of abatement.
If the plan sponsor determines that the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its partial withdrawal liability under § 4208.4, then—
(1) The employer's partial withdrawal liability shall be eliminated or its annual partial withdrawal liability payments shall be reduced in accordance with § 4208.6, as applicable;
(2) The employer's liability for a subsequent withdrawal shall be determined in accordance with § 4208.7;
(3) Any bonds furnished under § 4208.5 shall be canceled and any amounts held in escrow under § 4208.5 shall be refunded to the employer; and
(4) Any withdrawal liability payments originally due and paid after the end of the plan year in which the conditions for abatement were satisfied, in excess of the amount due under this part after that date shall be credited to the remaining withdrawal liability payments, if any, owed by the employer, beginning with the first payment due after the revised payment schedule is issued pursuant to this paragraph. If the credited amount is greater than the outstanding amount of the employer's partial withdrawal liability, the amount remaining after satisfaction of the liability shall be refunded to the employer. Interest on the credited amount at the rate prescribed in part 4219, subpart C, of this chapter (relating to overdue, defaulted, and overpaid withdrawal liability) shall be added if the plan sponsor does not issue a revised payment schedule reflecting the credit or make the required refund within 60 days after receipt by the plan sponsor of a complete abatement application. Interest shall accrue from the 61st day.
(d)
Effects of non-abatement.
If the plan sponsor determines that the employer does not satisfy the requirements for abatement of its partial withdrawal liability under § 4208.4, then the employer shall take or cause to be taken the actions set forth in paragraphs (d)(1)-(d)(3) of this section. The rules in part 4219, subpart C, shall apply with respect to all payments required to be made under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3). For this purpose, a payment required under paragraph (d)(2) shall be treated as a withdrawal liability payment due on the 30th day after the date of the plan sponsor's notice under paragraph (b) of this section.
(1) Any bond or escrow furnished under § 4208.5 shall be paid to the plan within 30 days after the date of the plan sponsor's notice under paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) The employer shall pay to the plan within 30 days after the date of the plan sponsor's notice under paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of its withdrawal liability payment or payments, with respect to which the bond or escrow was furnished, in excess of the bond or escrow.
(3) The employer shall resume or continue making its partial withdrawal liability payments as they are due to the plan.
(e)
Review of non-abatement determination.
A plan sponsor's determinations that the employer does not satisfy the requirements for abatement under § 4208.4 and of the amount of reduction determined under § 4208.6 shall be subject to plan review under section 4219(b)(2) of ERISA and to arbitration under section 4221 of ERISA and part 4221 of this chapter, within the times prescribed by those provisions. For this purpose, the plan sponsor's notice under paragraph (b) of this section shall be treated as a demand under section 4219(b)(1) of ERISA. If the plan sponsor upon review or an arbitrator determines that the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement of its partial withdrawal liability under § 4208.4, the plan sponsor shall immediately refund the amounts described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section if the liability is waived, or credit and refund the amounts described in paragraph (e)(2) if the annual payment is reduced.
(1)
Refund for waived liability.
If the employer's partial withdrawal liability is waived, the plan sponsor shall refund to the employer the payments made pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1)-(d)(3) of this section (plus interest determined in accordance with § 4219.31(d) of this chapter as if the payments were overpayments of withdrawal liability).
(2)
Credit for reduced annual payment.
If the employer's annual partial withdrawal liability payment is reduced, the plan sponsor shall credit the payments made pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1)-(d)(3) of this section (plus interest determined in accordance with § 4219.31(d) of this chapter as if the payments were overpayments of withdrawal liability) to future withdrawal liability payments owed by the employer, beginning with the first payment that is due after the determination, and refund any credit (including interest) remaining after satisfaction of the outstanding amount of the employer's partial withdrawal liability.
§ 4208.4
Conditions for abatement.
(a)
Waiver of liability for a 70-percent contribution decline.
An employer that
has incurred a partial withdrawal under section 4205(a)(1) of ERISA shall have no obligation to make payments with respect to that partial withdrawal (other than delinquent payments) for plan years beginning after the second consecutive plan year in which the conditions of either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) are satisfied for each of the two years:
(1) The number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer has an obligation to contribute under the plan for each year is not less than 90 percent of the total number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute to the plan for the high base year (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section).
(2) The conditions of this paragraph are satisfied if—
(i) The number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer has an obligation to contribute for each year exceeds 30 percent of the total number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute to the plan for the high base year (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section); and
(ii) The total number of contribution base units with respect to which all employers under the plan have obligations to contribute in each of the two years is not less than 90 percent of the total number of contribution base units for which all employers had obligations to contribute in the partial withdrawal year.
(b)
Waiver of liability for a partial cessation of the employer's contribution obligation.
Except as provided in § 4208.8, an employer that has incurred partial withdrawal liability under section 4205(a)(2) of ERISA shall have no obligation to make payments with respect to that partial withdrawal (other than delinquent payments) for plan years beginning after the second consecutive plan year in which the employer satisfies the conditions under either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.
(1)
Partial restoration of withdrawn work.
The employer satisfies the conditions under this paragraph if, for each of two consecutive plan years—
(i) The employer makes contributions for the same facility or under the same collective bargaining agreement that gave rise to the partial withdrawal;

(2)
Substantial restoration of withdrawn work.
The employer satisfies the conditions under this paragraph if, for each of two consecutive plan years—
(i) The employer makes contributions for the same facility or under the same collective bargaining agreement that gave rise to the partial withdrawal;
(ii) The employer's contribution base units for that facility or under that agreement are not less than 90 percent of the contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute for that facility or under that agreement for the high base year (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section); and
(iii) The total number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer has an obligation to contribute to the plan equals or exceeds the sum of—
(A) The number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute in the year prior to the partial withdrawal year, determined without regard to the contribution base units for the facility or under the agreement that gave rise to the partial withdrawal; and
(B) 90 percent of the contribution base units with respect to which the
employer had an obligation to contribute for that facility or under that agreement in either the year prior to the partial withdrawal year or the high base year (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), whichever is less.
(c)
Reduction in annual partial withdrawal liability payment
—(1)
Partial withdrawals under section 4205(a)(1).
An employer shall be entitled to a reduction of its annual partial withdrawal liability payment for a plan year if the number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute during the plan year exceeds the greater of—
(i) 110 percent (or such lower number as the plan may, by amendment, adopt) of the number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute in the partial withdrawal year; or
(ii) The total number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute to the plan for the plan year following the partial withdrawal year.
(2)
Partial withdrawals under section 4205(a)(2).
An employer that resumes the obligation to contribute with respect to a facility or collective bargaining agreement that gave rise to a partial withdrawal, but does not qualify to have that liability waived under paragraph (b) of this section, shall have its annual partial withdrawal liability payment reduced for any plan year in which the total number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer has an obligation to contribute equals or exceeds the sum of—
(i) The number of contribution base units for the reentered facility or agreement during that year; and
(ii) The total number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute to the plan for the year following the partial withdrawal year.
(d)
High base year.
For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the high base year contributions are the average of the total contribution base units for the two plan years for which the employer's total contribution base units were highest within the five plan years immediately preceding the beginning of the 3-year testing period defined in section 4205(b)(1)(B)(i) of ERISA, with respect to paragraph (a) of this section, or the partial withdrawal year, with respect to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) of this section, the high base year contributions are the average number of contribution base units for the facility or under the agreement for the two plan years for which the employer's contribution base units for that facility or under that agreement were highest within the five plan years immediately preceding the partial withdrawal.
§ 4208.5
Withdrawal liability payments during pendency of abatement determination.
(a)
Bond/Escrow.
An employer that has satisfied the requirements of § 4208.4(a)(1) without regard to “90 percent of” or § 4208.4(b) for one year with respect to all partial withdrawals it incurred in a plan year may, in lieu of making scheduled withdrawal liability payments in the second year for those withdrawals, provide a bond to, or establish an escrow account for, the plan that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section or any plan rules adopted under paragraph (d) of this section, pending a determination by the plan sponsor of whether the employer satisfies the requirements of § 4208.4 (a)(1) or (b) for the second consecutive plan year. An employer that applies for abatement and neither provides a bond/escrow nor makes its withdrawal liability payments remains eligible for abatement.
(b)
Amount of bond/escrow.
The bond or escrow allowed by this section shall be in an amount equal to 50 percent of the withdrawal liability payments that would otherwise be due. The bond or escrow relating to each payment shall be furnished before the due date of that payment. A single bond or escrow may be provided for more than one payment due during the pendency of the plan sponsor's determination. The bond or escrow agreement shall provide that if the plan sponsor determines that the employer does not satisfy the requirements for abatement of its partial withdrawal liability under § 4208.4 (a)(1) or (b), the bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan upon notice from the plan
sponsor to the bonding or escrow agent. A bond provided under this paragraph shall be issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 412 of ERISA.
(c)
Notice of bond/escrow.
Concurrently with posting a bond or establishing an escrow account under this section, the employer shall notify the plan sponsor. The notice shall include a statement of the amount of the bond or escrow, the scheduled payment or payments with respect to which the bond or escrow is being furnished, and the name and address of the bonding or escrow agent.
(d)
Plan amendments concerning bond/escrow.
A plan may, by amendment, adopt rules decreasing the amount of the bond or escrow specified in paragraph (b) of this section. A plan amendment adopted under this paragraph may be applied only to the extent that it is consistent with the purposes of ERISA. An amendment satisfies this requirement only if it does not create an unreasonable risk of loss to the plan.
(e)
Plan sponsor determination.
Within 60 days after the end of the plan year in which the bond/escrow is furnished, the plan sponsor shall determine whether the employer satisfied the requirements of § 4208.4 (a)(1) or (b) for the second consecutive plan year. The plan sponsor shall notify the employer and the bonding or escrow agent in writing of its determination and of the consequences of its determination, as described in § 4208.3 (c) or (d) and (e), as appropriate.
§ 4208.6
Computation of reduced annual partial withdrawal liability payment.
(a)
Amount of reduced payment.
An employer that satisfies the requirements of § 4208.4 (c)(1) or (c)(2) shall have its annual partial withdrawal liability payment for that plan year reduced in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, respectively.
(1) The reduced annual payment amount for an employer that satisfies § 4208.4(c)(1) shall be determined by substituting the number of contribution base units in the plan year in which the requirements are satisfied for the number of contribution base units in the year following the partial withdrawal year in the numerator of the fraction described in section 4206(a)(2)(A) of ERISA.
(2) The reduced annual payment for an employer that satisfies § 4208.4(c)(2) shall be determined by adding the contribution base units for which the employer is obligated to contribute with respect to the reentered facility or agreement in the year in which the requirements are satisfied to the numerator of the fraction described in section 4206(a)(2)(A) of ERISA.
(b)
Credit for reduction.
The plan sponsor shall credit the account of an employer that satisfies the requirements of § 4208.4(c)(1) or (c)(2) with the amount of annual withdrawal liability that it paid in excess of the amount described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, as appropriate. The credit shall be applied, a revised payment schedule issued, refund made and interest added, all in accordance with § 4208.3(c)(4).
§ 4208.7
Adjustment of withdrawal liability for subsequent withdrawals.
The liability of an employer for a partial or complete withdrawal from a plan subsequent to a partial withdrawal from that plan in a prior plan year shall be reduced in accordance with part 4206 of this chapter.
§ 4208.8
Multiple partial withdrawals in one plan year.
(a)
General rule.
If an employer partially withdraws from the same multiemployer plan on two or more occasions during the same plan year, the rules of § 4208.4 shall be applied as modified by this section.
(b)
Partial withdrawals under section 4205 (a)(1) and (a)(2) in the same plan year.
If an employer partially withdraws from the same multiemployer plan as a result of a 70-percent contribution decline and a partial cessation of the employer's contribution obligation in the same plan year, the employer shall not be eligible for abatement under § 4208.4 (b) or (c)(2) or under paragraph (c) of this section. The employer may qualify for abatement under § 4208.4(a) and (c)(1) and under
any rules adopted by the plan pursuant to § 4208.9.
(c)
Multiple partial cessations of the employer's contribution obligation.
If an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute for more than one facility, under more than one collective bargaining agreement, or for one or more facilities and under one or more collective bargaining agreements, resulting in multiple partial withdrawals under section 4205(b)(2)(A) in the same plan year, the abatement rules in § 4208.4(b) shall be applied as modified by this paragraph. If an employer resumes work at all such facilities and under all such collective bargaining agreements, the determination of whether the employer qualifies for elimination of its liability under § 4208.4(b) shall be made by substituting the test set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for that prescribed by § 4208.4 (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2)(ii), as applicable. If the employer resumes work at or under fewer than all the facilities or collective bargaining agreements described in this paragraph, the employer cannot qualify for elimination of its liability under § 4208.4(b). However, the employer may qualify for a reduction in its partial withdrawal liability pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(1)
Resumption of work at all facilities and under all bargaining agreements.
The test under this paragraph is satisfied if for each of the two consecutive plan years referred to in § 4208.4(b), the employer's total contribution base units for the facilities and under the collective bargaining agreements with respect to which the employer incurred the multiple partial withdrawals exceed 30 percent of the total number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute for those facilities and under those agreements for the base year (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section).
(2)
Resumption at fewer than all facilities or under fewer than all bargaining agreements.
If the employer satisfies the conditions in § 4208.4 (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(iii) and paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, or the conditions in § 4208.4 (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(iii) and paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, as applicable, the employer's withdrawal liability shall be partially waived as set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
(i) With respect to a resumption of work under § 4208.4(b)(1), the condition under this paragraph is satisfied if, for the two consecutive plan years referred to in § 4208.4(b)(1), the employer's contribution base units for any reentered facility or agreement exceed 30 percent of the number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute for that facility or under that agreement for the base year (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section).
(ii) With respect to a resumption of work under § 4208.4(b)(2), the condition under this paragraph is satisfied if, for the two consecutive plan years referred to in § 4208.4(b)(2), the employer's contribution base units for any reentered facility or agreement exceed 90 percent of the number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute for that facility or under that agreement for the base year (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section).
(iii) The employer's reduced withdrawal liability and, if any, the reduced annual payments of the liability shall be determined by adding the average number of contribution base units that the employer is required to contribute for those two consecutive years for that facility(ies) or agreement(s) to the numerator of the fraction described in section 4206(a)(2)(A) of ERISA. The amount of any remaining partial withdrawal liability shall be paid over the schedule originally established starting with the first payment due after the revised payment schedule is issued under § 4208.3(c)(4).
(d)
Base year.
For purposes of this section, the base year contribution base units for a reentered facility(ies) or under a reentered agreement(s) are the average number of contribution base units for the facility(ies) or under the agreement(s) for the two plan years for which the employer's contribution base units for that facility(ies) or under that agreement(s) were highest within the five plan years immediately preceding the partial withdrawal.
§ 4208.9
Plan adoption of additional abatement conditions.
(a)
General rule.
A plan may by amendment, subject to the approval of the PBGC, adopt rules for the reduction or waiver of partial withdrawal liability under conditions other than those specified in § 4208.4, provided that such conditions relate to events occurring or factors existing subsequent to a partial withdrawal year. The request for PBGC approval shall be filed after the amendment is adopted. PBGC approval shall also be required for any subsequent modification of the amendment, other than repeal of the amendment. A plan amendment under this section may not be put into effect until it is approved by the PBGC. An amendment that is approved by the PBGC may apply retroactively.
(b)
Who may request.
The plan sponsor, or a duly authorized representative acting on behalf of the plan sponsor, shall sign and submit the request.
(c)
Where to file.
See § 4000.4 of this chapter for information on where to file.
(d)
Information.
Each request shall contain the following information:
(1) The name and address of the plan for which the plan amendment is being submitted and the telephone number of the plan sponsor or its duly authorized representative.
(2) The nine-digit Employer Identification Number (EIN) assigned to the plan sponsor by the IRS and the three-digit Plan Identification Number (PIN) assigned to the plan by the plan sponsor, and, if different, also the EIN-PIN last filed with the PBGC. If an EIN-PIN has not been assigned, that should be indicated.
(3) A copy of the executed amendment, including—
(i) The date on which the amendment was adopted;
(ii) The proposed effective date;
(iii) The full text of the rules on the reduction or waiver of partial withdrawal liability; and
(iv) The full text of the rules adjusting the reduction in the employer's liability for a subsequent partial or complete withdrawal, as required by section 4206(b)(1) of ERISA.
(4) A copy of the most recent actuarial valuation report of the plan.
(5) A statement certifying that notice of the adoption of the amendment and of the request for approval filed under this section has been given to all employers that have an obligation to contribute under the plan and to all employee organizations representing employees covered under the plan.
(e)
Supplemental information.
In addition to the information described in paragraph (d) of this section, a plan may submit any other information that it believes is pertinent to its request. The PBGC may require the plan sponsor to submit any other information that the PBGC determines that it needs to review a request under this section.
(f)
Criteria for PBGC approval.
The PBGC shall approve a plan amendment authorized by paragraph (a) of this section if it determines that the rules therein are consistent with the purposes of ERISA. An abatement amendment is not consistent with the purposes of ERISA unless the PBGC determines that—
(1) The amendment is not adverse to the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries in the aggregate; and
(2) The amendment would not significantly increase the PBGC's risk of loss with respect to the plan.

# Subpart A—General
§ 4211.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
Section 4211 of ERISA provides four methods for allocating unfunded vested benefits to employers that withdraw from a multiemployer plan: the presumptive method (section 4211(b)); the modified presumptive method (section 4211(c)(2)); the rolling-5 method (section 4211(c)(3)); and the direct attribution method (section 4211(c)(4)). With the minor exceptions covered in § 4211.3, a plan determines the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to a withdrawing employer in accordance with the presumptive method, unless the plan is amended to adopt an alternative allocative method. Generally, the PBGC must approve the adoption of an alternative allocation method. On September 25, 1984, 49 FR 37686, the PBGC granted a class approval of all plan amendments adopting one of the statutory alternative allocation methods. Subpart C sets forth the criteria and procedures for PBGC approval of nonstatutory alternative allocation methods. Section 4211(c)(5) of ERISA also permits certain modifications to the statutory allocation methods that PBGC may prescribe in a regulation. Subpart B of this part contains the permissible modifications to the statutory methods that plan sponsors may adopt without PBGC approval. Plans may adopt other modifications subject to PBGC approval under subpart C. Finally, under section 4211(f) of ERISA, the PBGC is required to prescribe rules governing the application of the statutory allocation methods or modified methods by plans following merger of multiemployer plans. Subpart D sets forth alternative allocative methods to be used by merged plans. In addition, such plans may adopt any of the allocation methods or modifications described under subparts B and C in accordance with the rules under subparts B and C.
(b)
Scope.
This part applies to all multiemployer plans covered by title IV of ERISA.
[61 FR 34097, July 1, 1996, as amended at 86 FR 1271, Jan. 8, 2021]
§ 4211.2
Definitions.
The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: Code, employer, IRS, multiemployer plan, nonforfeitable benefit, PBGC, plan, and plan year.
In addition, for purposes of this part:
Initial plan year
means a merged plan's first complete plan year that begins after the effective date of the merged plan.
Initial plan year unfunded vested benefits
means the unfunded vested benefits as of the close of the initial plan year, less the value as of the end of the initial plan year of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability that can reasonably be expected to be collected from employers that had withdrawn as of the end of the initial plan year.
Merged plan
means a plan that is the result of the merger of two or more multiemployer plans.
Merger
means the combining of two or more multiemployer plans into one multiemployer plan.
Prior plan
means the plan in which an employer participated immediately before that plan became a part of the merged plan.
Unfunded vested benefits
means, as described in section 4213(c) of ERISA, the amount by which the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan exceeds the value of the assets of the plan.
Withdrawing employer
means the employer for which withdrawal liability is being calculated under section 4201 of ERISA.
Withdrawn employer
means an employer that, in a plan year before the withdrawing employer withdraws, has discontinued contributions to the plan or covered operations under the plan and whose obligation to contribute has not been assumed by a successor employer within the meaning of section 4204 of ERISA. A temporary suspension of contributions, including a suspension described in section 4218(2) of ERISA, is not considered a discontinuance of contributions.
[61 FR 34097, July 1, 1996, as amended at 73 FR 79635, Dec. 30, 2008; 86 FR 1271, Jan. 8, 2021]

§ 4211.4
Contributions for purposes of the numerator and denominator of the allocation fractions.
(a)
In general.
Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, each of the allocation fractions used in the presumptive, modified presumptive and rolling-5 methods is based on contributions that certain employers have made to the plan for a 5-year period.
(1) The numerator of the allocation fraction, with respect to a withdrawing employer, is based on the “sum of the contributions required to be made” or the “total amount required to be contributed” by the employer for the specified period.
(2) The denominator of the allocation fraction is based on contributions that certain employers have made to the plan for a specified period.
(b)
Disregarding surcharges and contribution increases.

Surcharge.
Any surcharge under section 305(e)(7) of ERISA and section 432(e)(7) of the Code.
(2)
Contribution increase.
Any increase in the contribution rate or other increase in contribution requirements that goes into effect during plan years beginning after December 31, 2014, so that a plan may meet the requirements of a funding improvement plan under section 305(c) of ERISA and section 432(c) of the Code or a rehabilitation plan under section 305(e) of ERISA and 432(e) of the Code, except to the extent that one of the following exceptions applies pursuant to section 305(g)(3) or (4) of ERISA and section 432(g)(3) or (4) of the Code:
(i) The increases in contribution requirements are due to increased levels of work, employment, or periods for which compensation is provided.
(ii) The additional contributions are used to provide an increase in benefits, including an increase in future benefit accruals, permitted by section 305(d)(1)(B) or (f)(1)(B) of ERISA and section 432(d)(1)(B) or (f)(1)(B) of the Code.
(iii) The withdrawal occurs on or after the expiration date of the employer's collective bargaining agreement in effect in the plan year the plan is no longer in endangered or critical status, or, if earlier, the date as of which the employer renegotiates a contribution rate effective after the plan year the plan is no longer in endangered or critical status.
(c)
Simplified methods.
See §§ 4211.14 and 4211.15 for simplified methods of meeting the requirements of this section.

A plan sponsor may amend a plan to incorporate the simplified methods in §§ 4211.14 and 4211.15 to fulfill the requirements of § 4211.4 with the modifications in this section if done consistently from year to year.
(b)
Changing the period for counting contributions.
A plan sponsor may
amend a plan to modify the denominators in the presumptive, modified presumptive and rolling-5 methods in accordance with one of the alternatives described in this paragraph (b). Any amendment adopted under this paragraph (b) must be applied consistently to all plan years. Contributions counted for 1 plan year may not be counted for any other plan year. If a contribution is counted as part of the “total amount contributed” for any plan year used to determine a denominator, that contribution may not also be counted as a contribution owed with respect to an earlier year used to determine the same denominator, regardless of when the plan collected that contribution.
(1) A plan sponsor may amend a plan to provide that “the sum of all contributions made” or “total amount contributed” for a plan year means the amount of contributions that the plan actually received during the plan year, without regard to whether the contributions are treated as made for that plan year under section 304(b)(3)(A) of ERISA and section 431(b)(3)(A) of the Code.
(2) A plan sponsor may amend a plan to provide that “the sum of all contributions made” or “total amount contributed” for a plan year means the amount of contributions actually received during the plan year, increased by the amount of contributions received during a specified period of time after the close of the plan year not to exceed the period described in section 304(c)(8) of ERISA and section 431(c)(8) of the Code and regulations thereunder.
(3) A plan sponsor may amend a plan to provide that “the sum of all contributions made” or “total amount contributed” for a plan year means the amount of contributions actually received during the plan year, increased by the amount of contributions accrued during the plan year and received during a specified period of time after the close of the plan year not to exceed the period described in section 304(c)(8) of ERISA and section 431(c)(8) of the Code and regulations thereunder.
(c)
Excluding contributions of significant withdrawn employers.
Contributions of certain withdrawn employers are excluded from the denominator in each of the fractions used to determine a withdrawing employer's share of unfunded vested benefits under the presumptive, modified presumptive and rolling-5 methods. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, contributions of all employers that permanently cease to have an obligation to contribute to the plan or permanently cease covered operations before the end of the period of plan years used to determine the fractions for allocating unfunded vested benefits under each of those methods (and contributions of all employers that withdrew before September 26, 1980) are excluded from the denominators of the fractions.
(1) The plan sponsor of a plan using the presumptive, modified presumptive or rolling-5 method may amend the plan to provide that only the contributions of significant withdrawn employers are excluded from the denominators of the fractions used in those methods.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph (c), “significant withdrawn employer” means—
(i) An employer to which the plan has sent a notice of withdrawal liability under section 4219 of ERISA; or
(ii) A withdrawn employer that in any plan year used to determine the denominator of a fraction contributed at least $250,000 or, if less, 1 percent of all contributions made by employers for that year.
(3) If a group of employers withdraw in a concerted withdrawal, the plan sponsor must treat the group as a single employer in determining whether the members are significant withdrawn employers under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A “concerted withdrawal” means a cessation of contributions to the plan during a single plan year—
(i) By an employer association;
(ii) By all or substantially all of the employers covered by a single collective bargaining agreement; or
(iii) By all or substantially all of the employers covered by agreements with a single labor organization.
(d)
“Fresh start” rules under presumptive method.
(1) The plan sponsor of a plan using the presumptive method (including a plan that primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry) may amend the plan to provide that—
(i) A designated plan year ending after September 26, 1980, will substitute for the plan year ending before September 26, 1980, in applying section 4211(b)(1)(B), section 4211(b)(2)(B)(ii)(I), section 4211(b)(2)(D), section 4211(b)(3), and section 4211(b)(3)(B) of ERISA; and
(ii) Plan years ending after the end of the designated plan year in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section will substitute for plan years ending after September 25, 1980, in applying section 4211(b)(1)(A), section 4211(b)(2)(A), and section 4211(b)(2)(B)(ii)(II) of ERISA.
(2) A plan amendment made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section must provide that the plan's unfunded vested benefits for plan years ending after the designated plan year are reduced by the value of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability that can reasonably be expected to be collected from employers that had withdrawn from the plan as of the end of the designated plan year.
(3) In the case of a plan that primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry, the plan year designated by a plan amendment pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be a plan year for which the plan has no unfunded vested benefits determined in accordance with section 4211 of ERISA without regard to § 4211.6.
(e)
“Fresh start” rules under modified presumptive method.
(1) The plan sponsor of a plan using the modified presumptive method may amend the plan to provide—
(i) A designated plan year ending after September 26, 1980, will substitute for the plan year ending before September 26, 1980, in applying section 4211(c)(2)(B)(i) and section 4211(c)(2)(B)(ii)(I) and (II) of ERISA; and
(ii) Plan years ending after the end of the designated plan year will substitute for plan years ending after September 25, 1980, in applying section 4211(c)(2)(B)(ii)(II) and section 4211(c)(2)(C)(i)(II) of ERISA.
(2) A plan amendment made pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section must provide that the plan's unfunded vested benefits for plan years ending after the designated plan year are reduced by the value of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability that can reasonably be expected to be collected from employers that had withdrawn from the plan as of the end of the designated plan year.
[86 FR 1272, Jan. 8, 2021]
§ 4211.13
Modifications to the direct attribution method.
(a)
Error in direct attribution method.
The unfunded vested benefits allocated to a withdrawing employer under the direct attribution method are the sum of the employer's attributable liability, determined under section 4211(c)(4)(A)(i) and (B) of ERISA, and the employer's share of the plan's unattributable liability, determined under section 4211(c)(4)(E) and allocated to the employer under section 4211(c)(4)(F). Plan sponsors should allocate unattributable liabilities on the basis of the employer's share of the attributable liabilities. However, section 4211(c)(4)(F) of ERISA, which describes the allocation of unattributable liabilities, contains a typographical error. Therefore, plans adopting the direct attribution method must modify the phrase “as the amount determined under subparagraph (C) for the employer bears to the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraph (C) for all employers under the plan” in section 4211(c)(4)(F) by substituting “subparagraph (B)” for “subparagraph (C)” in both places it appears.
(b)
Allocating unattributable liability based on contributions in period before withdrawal.
A plan that is amended to adopt the direct attribution method may provide that instead of allocating the unattributable liability in accordance with section 4211(c)(4)(F) of ERISA, the employer's share of the plan's unattributable liability is determined by multiplying the plan's unattributable liability determined under section 4211(c)(4)(E) by a fraction—
(1) The numerator of which is the total amount of contributions required to be made by the withdrawing employer over a period of consecutive plan years (not fewer than five) ending before the withdrawal; and
(2) The denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the
plan by all employers for the same period of years used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, decreased by any amount contributed by an employer that withdrew from the plan during those plan years.

§ 4211.14
Simplified methods for disregarding certain contributions.
(a)
In general.
A plan sponsor may amend a plan without PBGC approval to adopt any of the simplified methods in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section to fulfill the requirements of section 305(g)(3) of ERISA and section 432(g)(3) of the Code and § 4211.4(b)(2) in determining an allocation fraction. Examples illustrating calculations using the simplified methods in this section are provided in the appendix to this part.
(b)
Simplified method for the numerator—after 2014 plan year.
A plan sponsor may amend a plan to provide that the withdrawing employer's required contributions for each plan year (a “target year”) after the date that is the later of the last day of the first plan year that ends on or after December 31, 2014 and the last day of the plan year the employer first contributes to the plan (the “employer freeze date”) is the product of—
(1) The employer's contribution rate in effect on the employer freeze date, plus any contribution increase in § 4211.4(b)(2)(ii) that is effective after the employer freeze date but not later than the last day of the target year; times
(2) The employer's contribution base units for the target year.
(c)
Simplified method for the denominator—after 2014 plan year.
A plan sponsor may amend a plan to provide that the denominator for the allocation fraction for each plan year after the employer freeze date is calculated using the same principles as paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Simplified method for the denominator—proxy group averaging.
(1) A plan sponsor may amend a plan to provide that, for purposes of determining the denominator of the unfunded vested benefits allocation fraction, employer contributions for a plan year beginning after the plan freeze date described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section are calculated, in accordance with this paragraph (d), based on an average of representative contribution rates that exclude contribution increases that are required to be disregarded in determining withdrawal liability. The method described in this paragraph (d) is effective only for plan years to which the amendment applies.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph (d) —
(i)
Plan freeze date
means the last day of the first plan year that ends on or after December 31, 2014.
(ii)
Base year
means the first plan year beginning after the plan freeze date.
(iii)
Contribution history
for a plan year means the history of total contribution rates, and contribution rates that are not required to be disregarded in determining withdrawal liability, from the plan freeze date up to the end of the plan year.
(iv)
Included employer
with respect to a plan for a plan year means an employer that is a contributing employer of the plan on at least 1 day of the plan year and whose contributions for the plan year are to be taken into account under the plan in determining the denominator of the unfunded vested benefits allocation fraction under section 4211 of ERISA. If the contribution histories of different categories of employees of an employer are not substantially the same, the employer may be treated as two or more employers that have more uniform contribution histories.
(v)
Rate history group
is defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(vi)
Proxy group
is defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(vii)
Adjusted
as applied to contributions for an employer, a rate history group, or a plan is defined in paragraphs (d)(5), (6), and (7) of this section.
(3) A rate history group of a plan for a plan year is a group of included employers satisfying all of the following requirements:
(i) Each included employer of the plan is in one and only one rate history group.
(ii) The employers in the rate history group have substantially the same contribution history (or the same percentage increases in contributions from year to year), but there need not be more than ten rate history groups.
(iii) There is consistency in the composition of rate history groups from year to year.
(4) The proxy group of a plan for a plan year is a group of included employers satisfying all of the following requirements:
(i) On at least 1 day of the plan year, the employers in the proxy group represent at least 10 percent of active plan participants.
(ii) There is at least one employer in the proxy group from each rate history group of the plan for the plan year that represents, on at least 1 day of the plan year, at least 5 percent of active plan participants.
(iii) There is consistency in the composition of the proxy group from year to year.
(5) The adjusted contributions of an employer under a plan for a plan year are —
(i) The employer's contribution base units for the plan year; multiplied by
(ii) The employer's contribution rate per contribution base unit at the end of the plan year, reduced by the sum of the employer's contribution rate increases since the plan freeze date that are required to be disregarded in determining withdrawal liability.
(6) The adjusted contributions of a rate history group that is represented in the proxy group of a plan for a plan year are the total contributions for the plan year attributable to employers in the rate history group, multiplied by the adjustment factor for the rate history group. The adjustment factor for the rate history group is the quotient, for all employers in the rate history group that are also in the proxy group, of —
(i) Total adjusted contributions for the plan year; divided by
(ii) Total contributions for the plan year.
(7) The adjusted contributions of a plan for a plan year are the plan's total contributions for the plan year by all employers, multiplied by the adjustment factor for the plan. For this purpose, “the plan's total contributions for the plan year” means the total unadjusted plan contributions for the plan year that would otherwise be included in the denominator of the allocation fraction in the absence of section 305(g)(1) of ERISA, including any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods that were collected in that plan year, and excluding any amounts contributed in that plan year by an employer that withdrew from the plan during that plan year. The adjustment factor for the plan is the quotient, for all rate history groups that are represented in the proxy group, of —
(i) Total adjusted contributions for the plan year; divided by
(ii) Total contributions for the plan year.
(8) Under this method, in determining the denominator of a plan's unfunded vested benefits allocation fraction, the contributions taken into account with respect to any plan year (beginning with the base year) are the plan's adjusted contributions for the plan year.
(9) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (d), if total contributions for a year for a rate history group or for a plan are not timely and reasonably available for calculating adjusted contributions for that year, each relevant contribution rate for the year may be multiplied by the projected contribution base units for the year corresponding to that rate and the sum, for all rates, may be used in place of total contributions for that year.
(e)
Effective and applicability dates
—(1)
Effective date.
This section is effective on February 8, 2021.
(2)
Applicability date.
This section applies to employer withdrawals from multiemployer plans that occur in plan years beginning on or after February 8, 2021.

§ 4211.15
Simplified methods for determining expiration date of a collective bargaining agreement.
(a)
In general.
A plan sponsor may amend a plan without PBGC approval to adopt any of the simplified methods
in this section to fulfill the requirements of section 305(g)(4) of ERISA and 432(g)(4) of the Code and § 4211.4(b)(2)(iii) for a withdrawal that occurs on or after the plan's reversion date.
(b)
Reversion date.
The reversion date is either—
(1) The expiration date of the first collective bargaining agreement requiring plan contributions that expires after the plan is no longer in endangered or critical status, or
(2) The date that is the later of—
(i) The end of the first plan year following the plan year in which the plan is no longer in endangered or critical status; or
(ii) The end of the plan year that includes the expiration date of the first collective bargaining agreement requiring plan contributions that expires after the plan is no longer in endangered or critical status.
(3) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the expiration date of a collective bargaining agreement that by its terms remains in force until terminated by the parties thereto is considered to be the earlier of—
(i) The termination date agreed to by the parties thereto; or
(ii) The first day of the third plan year following the plan year in which the plan is no longer in endangered or critical status.
(c)
Example.
The simplified method in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is illustrated by the following example.
(1)
Facts.
A plan certifies that it is not in endangered or critical status for the plan year beginning January 1, 2021. The plan operates under several collective bargaining agreements. The plan sponsor adopts a rule providing that all contribution increases will be included in the numerator and denominator of the allocation fractions for withdrawals occurring after October 31, 2022, the expiration date of the first collective bargaining agreement requiring plan contributions that expires after January 1, 2021.
(2)
Allocation fraction.
A contributing employer withdraws from the plan in November 2022, after the date designated by the plan sponsor for the inclusion of all contribution rate increases in the allocation fraction. The allocation fraction used by the plan sponsor to determine the employer's share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits includes all of the employer's required contributions in the numerator and total contributions made by all employers in the denominator, including any amounts related to contribution increases previously disregarded.

§ 4211.16
Simplified methods for disregarding benefit reductions and benefit suspensions.
(a)
In general.
A plan sponsor may amend a plan without PBGC approval to adopt the simplified methods in this section to fulfill the requirements of section 305(g)(1) of ERISA and section 432(g)(1) of the Code and § 4211.6 to disregard benefit reductions and benefit suspensions.
(b)
Basic rule.
The withdrawal liability of a withdrawing employer is the sum of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and then adjusted by paragraphs (A)-(D) of section 4201(b)(1) of ERISA. The amount determined under paragraph (b)(1) may not be less than zero.
(1) The amount that would be the employer's allocable amount of unfunded vested benefits determined in accordance with section 4211 of ERISA under the method in use by the plan without regard to § 4211.6 (but taking into account § 4211.4); and
(2) The employer's proportional share of the value of each of the benefit reductions and benefit suspensions required to be disregarded under § 4211.6 determined in accordance with this section.
(c)
Benefit suspension.
This paragraph (c) applies to a benefit suspension under § 4211.6(a)(3).
(1)
General.
The employer's proportional share of the present value of a benefit suspension as of the end of the
plan year before the employer's withdrawal is determined by applying paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section to the present value of the suspended benefits, as authorized by the Department of the Treasury in accordance with section 305(e)(9) of ERISA, calculated either as of the date of the benefit suspension or as of the end of the plan year coincident with or following the date of the benefit suspension (the “authorized value”).
(2)
Static value method.
A plan may provide that the present value of the suspended benefits as of the end of the plan year in which the benefit suspension takes effect and for each of the succeeding 9 plan years is the authorized value in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. An employer's proportional share of the present value of a benefit suspension to which this paragraph (c) applies using the static value method is determined by multiplying the present value of the suspended benefits by a fraction—
(i) The numerator is the sum of all contributions required to be made by the withdrawing employer for the 5 consecutive plan years ending before the plan year in which the benefit suspension takes effect; and
(ii) The denominator is the total of all employers' contributions for the 5 consecutive plan years ending before the plan year in which the suspension takes effect, increased by any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed by an employer that withdrew from the plan during those plan years. If a plan uses an allocation method other than the presumptive method in section 4211(b) of ERISA or similar method, the denominator after the first year is decreased by the contributions of any employers that withdrew from the plan and were unable to satisfy their withdrawal liability claims in any year before the employer's withdrawal.
(iii) In determining the numerator and the denominator in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the rules under § 4211.4 (and permissible modifications under § 4211.12 and simplified methods under §§ 4211.14 and 4211.15) apply.
(3)
Adjusted value method.
A plan may provide that the present value of the suspended benefits as of the end of the plan year in which the benefit suspension takes effect is the authorized value in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and that the present value as of the end of each of the succeeding nine plan years (the “revaluation date”) is the present value, as of a revaluation date, of the benefits not expected to be paid after the revaluation date due to the benefit suspension. An employer's proportional share of the present value of a benefit suspension to which this paragraph (c) applies using the adjusted value method is determined by multiplying the present value of the suspended benefits by a fraction—
(i) The numerator is the sum of all contributions required to be made by the withdrawing employer for the 5 consecutive plan years ending before the employer's withdrawal; and
(ii) The denominator is the total of all employers' contributions for the 5 consecutive plan years ending before the employer's withdrawal, increased by any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed by an employer that withdrew from the plan during those plan years.
(iii) In determining the numerator and the denominator in this paragraph (c)(3), the rules under § 4211.4 (and permissible modifications under § 4211.12 and simplified methods under §§ 4211.14 and 4211.15) apply.
(iv) If a benefit suspension in § 4211.6(a)(3) is a temporary suspension of the plan's payment obligations as authorized by the Department of the Treasury, the present value of the suspended benefits in this paragraph (c)(3) includes only the value of the suspended benefits through the ending period of the benefit suspension.
(d)
Benefit reductions.
This paragraph (d) applies to benefits reduced under § 4211.6(a)(1) or (2).
(1)
Value of a benefit reduction.
The value of a benefit reduction is—
(i) The unamortized balance, as of the end of the plan year before the withdrawal, of;
(ii) The value of the benefit reduction as of the end of the plan year in which the reduction took effect; and
(iii) Determined using the same assumptions as for unfunded vested benefits and amortization in level annual installments over a period of 15 years.
(2)
Employer's proportional share of a benefit reduction.
An employer's proportional share of the value of a benefit reduction to which this paragraph (d) applies is determined by multiplying the value of the benefit reduction by a fraction—
(i) The numerator is the sum of all contributions required to be made by the withdrawing employer for the 5 consecutive plan years ending before the employer's withdrawal; and
(ii) The denominator is the total of all employers' contributions for the 5 consecutive plan years ending before the employer's withdrawal, increased by any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed by an employer that withdrew from the plan during those plan years.
(iii) The 5 consecutive plan years ending before the plan year in which the adjustable benefit reduction takes effect may be used in determining the numerator and the denominator in this paragraph (d). If such 5-year period is used, in determining the denominator, if a plan uses an allocation method other than the presumptive method in section 4211(b) of ERISA or similar method, the denominator after the first year is decreased by the contributions of any employers that withdrew from the plan and were unable to satisfy their withdrawal liability claims in any year before the employer's withdrawal.
(iv) In determining the numerator and the denominator in this paragraph (d), the rules under § 4211.4 (and permissible modifications under § 4211.12 and simplified methods under §§ 4211.14 and 4211.15) apply.
(e)
Example.
The simplified framework using the static value method under § 4211.16(c)(2) for disregarding a benefit suspension is illustrated by the following example.
(1)
Facts.
Assume that a calendar year multiemployer plan receives final authorization by the Secretary of the Treasury for a benefit suspension, effective January 1, 2018. The present value, as of that date, of the benefit suspension is $30 million. Employer A, a contributing employer, withdraws during the 2022 plan year. Employer A's proportional share of contributions for the 5 plan years ending in 2017 (the year before the benefit suspension takes effect) is 10 percent. Employer A's proportional share of contributions for the 5 plan years ending before Employer A's withdrawal in 2022 is 11 percent. The plan uses the rolling-5 method for allocating unfunded vested benefits to withdrawn employers under section 4211 of ERISA. The plan sponsor has adopted by amendment the static value simplified method for disregarding benefit suspensions in determining unfunded vested benefits. Accordingly, there is a one-time valuation of the initial value of the suspended benefits with respect to employer withdrawals occurring during the 2019 through 2028 plan years, the first 10 years of the benefit suspension.
(2)
Unfunded vested benefits allocable to Employer A.
To determine the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to Employer A, the plan's actuary first determines the amount of Employer A's withdrawal liability as of the end of 2021 assuming the benefit suspensions remain in effect. Under the rolling-5 method, if the plan's unfunded vested benefits as determined in the plan's 2021 plan year valuation were $170 million (not including the present value of the suspended benefits), the share of these unfunded vested benefits allocable to Employer A is equal to $170 million multiplied by Employer A's allocation fraction of 11 percent, or $18.7 million. The plan's actuary then adds to this amount Employer A's proportional 10 percent share of the $30 million initial value of the suspended benefits, or $3 million. Employer A's share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits for withdrawal liability purposes is $21.7 million ($18.7 million + $3 million).
(3)
Adjustment of allocation fraction.
If another significant contributing employer—Employer B—had withdrawn in 2019 and was unable to satisfy its withdrawal liability claim, the allocation
fraction applicable to the value of the suspended benefits is adjusted. The contributions in the denominator for the last 5 plan years ending in 2017 is reduced by the contributions that were made by Employer B, thereby increasing Employer A's allocable share of the $30 million value of the suspended benefits.

# Subpart C—Changes Subject to PBGC Approval
§ 4211.21
Changes subject to PBGC approval.
(a)
General rule.
Subject to the approval of the PBGC pursuant to this subpart, a plan, other than a plan that primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry, may adopt, by amendment, any allocation method or modification to an allocation method that is not permitted under subpart B of this part.
(b)
Building and construction industry plans.
Subject to the approval of the PBGC pursuant to this subpart, a plan that primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry may adopt, by amendment, any allocation method or modification to an allocation method that is not permitted under section 4211 of ERISA if the method or modification is applicable only to its employers that are not construction industry employers within the meaning of section 4203(b)(1)(A) of ERISA.
(c)
Substantial overallocation not allowed.
No plan may adopt an allocation method or modification to an allocation method that results in a systematic and substantial overallocation of the plan's unfunded vested benefits.
(d)
Use of method prior to approval.
A plan may implement an alternative allocation method or modification to an allocation method that requires PBGC approval before that approval is given. However, the plan sponsor shall assess liability in accordance with this paragraph.
(1)
Demand for payment.
Until the PBGC approves the allocation method or modification, a plan may not demand withdrawal liability under section 4219 of ERISA in an amount that exceeds the lesser of the amount calculated under the amendment or the amount calculated under the allocation method that the plan would be required to use if the PBGC did not approve the amendment. The plan must inform each withdrawing employer of both amounts and explain that the higher amount may become payable depending on the PBGC's decision on the amendment.
(2)
Adjustment of liability.
When necessary because of the PBGC decision on the amendment, the plan shall adjust the amount demanded from each employer under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the employer's withdrawal liability payment schedule. The length of the payment schedule shall be increased, as necessary. The plan shall notify each affected employer of the adjusted liability and payment schedule and shall collect the adjusted amount in accordance with the adjusted schedule.

(7) A statement certifying that notice of the adoption of the amendment has been given to all employers that have an obligation to contribute under the plan and to all employee organizations that represent employees covered by the plan.
(e)
Additional information.
In addition to the information listed in paragraph (d) of this section, the PBGC may require the plan sponsor to submit any other information that the PBGC determines is necessary for the review of an alternative allocation method or modification to an allocation method.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1212-0035)
[61 FR 34097, July 1, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 61355, Oct. 28, 2003]
§ 4211.23
Approval of alternative method.
(a)
General.
The PBGC shall approve an alternative allocation method or modification to an allocation method if the PBGC determines that adoption of the method or modification would not significantly increase the risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries or to the PBGC.
(b)
Criteria.
An alternative allocation method or modification to an allocation method satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if it meets the following three conditions:
(1) The method or modification allocates a plan's unfunded vested benefits, both for the adoption year and for the five subsequent plan years, to the same extent as any of the statutory allocation methods, or any modification to a statutory allocation method permitted under subpart B.
(2) The method or modification allocates unfunded vested benefits to each employer on the basis of either the employer's share of contributions to the plan or the unfunded vested benefits attributable to each employer. The method or modification may take into account differences in contribution rates paid by different employers and differences in benefits of different employers' employees.
(3) The method or modification fully reallocates among employers that have not withdrawn from the plan all unfunded vested benefits that the plan sponsor has determined cannot be collected from withdrawn employers, or that are not assessed against withdrawn employers because of section 4209, 4219(c)(1)(B) or 4225 of ERISA.
(c)
PBGC action on request.
The PBGC's decision on a request for approval shall be in writing. If the PBGC disapproves the request, the decision shall state the reasons for the disapproval and shall include a statement of the sponsor's right to request a reconsideration of the decision pursuant to part 4003 of this chapter.
§ 4211.24
Special rule for certain alternative methods previously approved.
A plan may not apply to any employer withdrawing on or after November 25, 1987, an allocation method approved by the PBGC before that date that allocates to the employer the greater of the amounts of unfunded vested benefits determined under two different allocation rules. Until a plan that has been using such a method is amended to adopt a valid allocation method, its allocation method shall be deemed to be the statutory allocation method that would apply if it had never been amended.

# Subpart D—Allocation Methods for Merged Multiemployer Plans
§ 4211.31
Allocation of unfunded vested benefits following the merger of plans.
(a)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, when two or more multiemployer plans merge, the merged plan shall adopt one of the statutory allocation methods, in accordance with subpart B of this part, or one of the allocation methods prescribed in §§ 4211.32 through 4211.35, and the method adopted shall apply to all employer withdrawals occurring after the initial plan year. Alternatively, a merged plan may adopt its own allocation method in accordance with subpart C of this part. If a merged plan fails to adopt an allocation method pursuant to this subpart or subpart B or C, it shall use the presumptive allocation method prescribed in § 4211.32. In addition, a merged plan may adopt any of the modifications prescribed in § 4211.36 or in subpart B of this part.
(b)
Construction plans.
Except as provided in the next sentence, a merged plan that primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry shall use the presumptive allocation method prescribed in § 4211.32. However, the plan may, with respect to employers that are not construction industry employers within the meaning of section 4203(b)(1)(A) of ERISA, adopt, by amendment, one of the alternative methods prescribed in §§ 4211.33 through 4211.35 or any other allocation method. Any such amendment shall be adopted in accordance with subpart C of this part. A construction plan may, without the PBGC's approval, adopt by amendment any of the modifications set forth in § 4211.36 or any of the modifications to the statutory presumptive method set forth in subpart B of this part.
(c)
Section 404(c) plans.
A merged plan that is a continuation of a plan described in section 404(c) of the Code shall use the rolling-5 allocation method prescribed in § 4211.34, unless the plan, by amendment, adopts an alternative method. The plan may adopt one of the statutory allocation methods or one of the allocation methods set forth in §§ 4211.32 through 4211.35 without PBGC approval; adoption of any other allocation method is subject to PBGC approval under subpart B of this plan. The plan may, without the PBGC's approval, adopt by amendment any of the modifications set forth in § 4211.36 or in subpart B of this part.
(d)
Withdrawals before the end of the initial plan year.
For employer withdrawals after the effective date of a merger and prior to the end of the initial plan year, the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to a withdrawing employer shall be determined in accordance with § 4211.37.
[61 FR 34097, July 1, 1996, as amended at 86 FR 1275, Jan. 8, 2021; 88 FR 76664, Nov. 7, 2023]
§ 4211.32
Presumptive method for withdrawals after the initial plan year.
(a)
General rule.
Under this section, the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws from a merged plan after the initial plan year is the sum (but not less than zero) of—
(1) The employer's proportional share, if any, of the unamortized amount of the plan's initial plan year unfunded vested benefits, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section;
(2) The employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the change in the plan's unfunded vested benefits for plan years ending after the initial plan year, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section; and
(3) The employer's proportional share of the unamortized amounts of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits (if any) as determined under paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Share of initial plan year unfunded vested benefits.
An employer's proportional share, if any, of the unamortized amount of the plan's initial plan year unfunded vested benefits is the sum of the employer's share of its prior plan's liabilities (determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) and the employer's share of the adjusted initial plan year unfunded vested benefits (determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section), with such sum reduced by five percent of the original amount for each
plan year subsequent to the initial year.
(1)
Share of prior plan liabilities.
An employer's share of its prior plan's liabilities is the amount of unfunded vested benefits that would have been allocable to the employer if it had withdrawn on the first day of the initial plan year, determined as if each plan had remained a separate plan.
(2)
Share of adjusted initial plan year unfunded vested benefits.
An employer's share of the adjusted initial plan year unfunded vested benefits equals the plan's initial plan year unfunded vested benefits, less the amount that would be determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for each employer that had not withdrawn as of the end of the initial plan year, multiplied by a fraction—
(i) The numerator of which is the amount determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
(ii) The denominator of which is the sum of the amounts that would be determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for each employer that had not withdrawn as of the end of the initial plan year.
(c)
Share of annual changes.
An employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the change in the plan's unfunded vested for the plan years ending after the end of the initial plan year is the sum of the employer's proportional shares (determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) of the unamortized amount of the change in unfunded vested benefits (determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) for each plan year in which the employer has an obligation to contribute under the plan ending after the initial plan year and before the plan year in which the employer withdraws.
(1)
Change in plan's unfunded vested benefits.
The change in a plan's unfunded vested benefits for a plan year is the amount by which the unfunded vested benefits at the end of a plan year, less the value as of the end of such year of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability that can reasonably be expected to be collected from employers that had withdrawn as of the end of the initial plan year, exceed the sum of the unamortized amount of the initial plan year unfunded vested benefits (determined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section) and the unamortized amounts of the change in unfunded vested benefits for each plan year ending after the initial plan year and preceding the plan year for which the change is determined (determined under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section).
(i)
Unamortized amount of initial plan year unfunded vested benefits.
The unamortized amount of the initial plan year unfunded vested benefits is the amount of those benefits reduced by five percent of the original amount for each succeeding plan year.
(ii)
Unamortized amount of the change.
The unamortized amount of the change in a plan's unfunded vested benefits with respect to a plan year is the change in unfunded vested benefits for the plan year, reduced by five percent of such change for each succeeding plan year.
(2)
Employer's proportional share.
An employer's proportional share of the amount determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is computed by multiplying that amount by a fraction—
(i) The numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed under the plan (or under the employer's prior plan) by the employer for the plan year in which the change arose and the four preceding full plan years; and
(ii) The denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan (or under employer's prior plan) for the plan year in which the change arose and the four preceding full plan years by all employers that had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the plan year in which such change arose, reduced by any amount contributed by an employer that withdrew from the plan in the year in which the change arose.
(iii) In determining the numerator and the denominator in this paragraph (c), the rules under § 4211.4 (and permissible simplified methods under §§ 4211.14 and 4211.15) apply.
(d)
Share of reallocated amounts.
An employer's proportional share of the unamortized amounts of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits, if any,
is the sum of the employer's proportional shares (determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) of the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits (determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section) for each plan year ending before the plan year in which the employer withdrew from the plan.
(1)
Unamortized amount of reallocated unfunded vested benefits.
The unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits with respect to a plan year is the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii), and (d)(1)(iii) of this section for the plan year, reduced by five percent of such sum for each succeeding plan year.
(i)
Uncollectible amounts.
Amounts included as reallocable under this paragraph are those that the plan sponsor determines in that plan year to be uncollectible for reasons arising out of cases or proceedings under title 11, United States Code, or similar proceedings, with respect to an employer that withdrew after the close of the initial plan year.
(ii)
Relief amounts.
Amounts included as reallocable under this paragraph are those that the plan sponsor determines in that plan year will not be assessed as a result of the operation of section 4209, 4219(c)(1)(B), or 4225 of ERISA with respect to an employer that withdrew after the close of the initial plan year.
(iii)
Other amounts.
Amounts included as reallocable under this paragraph are those that the plan sponsor determines in that plan year to be uncollectible or unassessable for other reasons under standards not inconsistent with regulations prescribed by the PBGC.
(2)
Employer's proportional share.
An employer's proportional share of the amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits with respect to a plan year is computed by multiplying the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits (as of the end of the year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws) by the allocation fraction described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for the same plan year.
[61 FR 34097, July 1, 1996, as amended at 86 FR 1275, Jan. 8, 2021]
§ 4211.33
Modified presumptive method for withdrawals after the initial plan year.
(a)
General rule.
Under this section, the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws from a merged plan after the initial plan year is the sum of the employer's proportional share, if any, of the unamortized amount of the plan's initial plan year unfunded vested benefits (determined under paragraph (b) of this section) and the employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the unfunded vested benefits arising after the initial plan year (determined under paragraph (c) of this section).
(b)
Share of initial plan year unfunded vested benefits.
An employer's proportional share, if any, of the unamortized amount of the plan's initial plan year unfunded vested benefits is the sum of the employer's share of its prior plan's liabilities, as determined under § 4211.32(b)(1), and the employer's share of the adjusted initial plan year unfunded vested benefits, as determined under § 4211.32(b)(2), with such sum reduced as if it were being fully amortized in level annual installments over fifteen years beginning with the first plan year after the initial plan year.
(c)
Share of unfunded vested benefits arising after the initial plan year.
An employer's proportional share of the amount of the plan's unfunded vested benefits arising after the initial plan year is the employer's proportional share (determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) of the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, reduced by the amount of the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the close of the initial plan year (determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
(1)
Amount of unfunded vested benefits.
The plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws shall be reduced by the sum of—
(i) The value as of that date of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability that can reasonably be expected
to be collected, with respect to employers that withdrew before that plan year; and
(ii) The sum of the amounts that would be allocable under paragraph (b) of this section to all employers that have an obligation to contribute in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and that also had an obligation to contribute in the first plan year ending after the initial plan year.
(2)
Employer's proportional share.
An employer's proportional share of the amount determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is computed by multiplying that amount by a fraction—
(i) The numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed under the plan (or under the employer's prior plan) by the employer for the last five full plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws; and
(ii) The denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan (or under each employer's prior plan) by all employers for the last five full plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws, increased by the amount of any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods that were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed by an employer that withdrew from the plan (or prior plan) during those plan years.
(iii) In determining the numerator and the denominator in this paragraph (c), the rules under § 4211.4 (and permissible simplified methods under §§ 4211.14 and 4211.15) apply.
[61 FR 34097, July 1, 1996, as amended at 86 FR 1276, Jan. 8, 2021]
§ 4211.34
Rolling-5 method for withdrawals after the initial plan year.
(a)
General rule.
Under this section, the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws from a merged plan after the initial plan year is the sum of the employer's proportional share, if any, of the unamortized amount of the plan's initial plan year unfunded vested benefits (determined under paragraph (b) of this section) and the employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the unfunded vested benefits arising after the initial plan year (determined under paragraph (c) of this section).
(b)
Share of initial plan year unfunded vested benefits.
An employer's proportional share, if any, of the unamortized amount of the plan's initial plan year unfunded vested benefits is the sum of the employer's share of its prior plan's liabilities, as determined under § 4211.32(b)(1), and the employer's share of the adjusted initial plan year unfunded vested benefits, as determined under § 4211.32(b)(2), with such sum reduced as if it were being fully amortized in level annual installments over five years beginning with the first plan year after the initial plan year.
(c)
Share of unfunded vested benefits arising after the initial plan year.
An employer's proportional share of the amount of the plan's unfunded vested benefits arising after the initial plan year is the employer's proportional share determined under § 4211.33(c).
§ 4211.35
Direct attribution method for withdrawals after the initial plan year.
The allocation method under this section is the allocation method described in section 4211(c)(4) of ERISA.
§ 4211.36
Modifications to the determination of initial liabilities, the amortization of initial liabilities, and the allocation fraction.
(a)
General rule.
A plan using any of the allocation methods described in §§ 4211.32 through 4211.34 may, by plan amendment and without PBGC approval, adopt any of the modifications described in this section. In determining the numerators and the denominators in paragraph (d) of this section, the rules under § 4211.4 (and permissible simplified methods under §§ 4211.14 and 4211.15) apply.
(b)
Restarting initial liabilities.
A plan may be amended to allocate the initial plan year unfunded vested benefits under § 4211.32(b), § 4211.33(b), or § 4211.34(b) without separately allocating to employers the liabilities attributable to their participation under their prior plans. An amendment under this paragraph must include an allocation fraction under paragraph (d) of
this section for determining the employer's proportional share of the total unfunded benefits as of the close of the initial plan year.
(c)
Amortizing initial liabilities.
A plan may by amendment modify the amortization of initial liabilities in either of the following ways:
(1) If two or more plans that use the presumptive allocation method of section 4211(b) of ERISA merge, the merged plan may adjust the amortization of initial liabilities under § 4211.32(b) to amortize those unfunded vested benefits over the remaining length of the prior plans' amortization schedules.
(2) A plan that has adopted the allocation method under § 4211.33 or § 4211.34 may adjust the amortization of initial liabilities under § 4211.33(b) or § 4211.34(b) to amortize those unfunded vested benefits in level annual installments over any period of at least five and not more than fifteen years.
(d)
Changing the allocation fraction.
A plan may by amendment replace the allocation fraction under § 4211.32(b), § 4211.33(b), or § 4211.34(b) with any of the following contribution-based fractions—
(1) A fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed under the merged and prior plans by the withdrawing employer in the 60-month period ending on the last day of the initial plan year, and the denominator of which is the sum for that period of the contributions made by all employers that had not withdrawn as of the end of the initial plan year;
(2) A fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed by the withdrawing employer for the initial plan year and the four preceding full plan years of its prior plan, and the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions made over that period by employers that had not withdrawn as of the end of the initial plan year; or
(3) A fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed to the plan by the withdrawing employer since the effective date of the merger, and the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions made over that period by employers that had not withdrawn as of the end of the initial plan year.
[61 FR 34097, July 1, 1996, as amended at 86 FR 1276, Jan. 8, 2021]
§ 4211.37
Allocating unfunded vested benefits for withdrawals before the end of the initial plan year.
If an employer withdraws after the effective date of a merger and before the end of the initial plan year, the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer shall be determined as if each plan had remained a separate plan. In making this determination, the plan sponsor shall use the allocation method of the withdrawing employer's prior plan and shall compute the employer's allocable share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits as if the day before the effective date of the merger were the end of the last plan year prior to the withdrawal.
Pt. 4211, App.

# Appendix to Part 4211—Examples
The examples in this appendix illustrate simplified methods for disregarding certain contribution increases in the allocation fraction provided in § 4211.14 of this part.
Example 1. Determining the Numerator of the Allocation Fraction Using the Employer's Plan Year 2014 Contribution Rate (§ 4211.14(b)).
Assume Plan X is a calendar year multiemployer plan in critical status which did not have a benefit increase after plan year 2014. In accordance with section 305(g)(3)(B) of ERISA, the annual 5 percent contribution rate increases applicable to Employer A and other employers in Plan X after the 2014 plan year were deemed to be required to enable the plan to meet the requirement of its rehabilitation plan and must be disregarded. Employer A, a contributing employer, withdraws from Plan X in 2021. Using the rolling-5 method, Plan X has unfunded vested benefits of $200 million as of the end of the 2020 plan year. To determine Employer A's allocable share of these unfunded vested benefits, Employer A's hourly required contribution rate and contribution base units for the 2014 plan year and each of the 5 plan years between 2016 and 2020 are identified as shown in the following table:

The plan sponsor makes a determination pursuant to section 305(g)(3) of ERISA that the annual 5 percent contribution rate increases applicable to Employer A and other employers in Plan X after the 2014 plan year were required to enable the plan to meet the requirement of its rehabilitation plan and should be disregarded; benefits were not increased after plan year 2014.
Applying the simplified method, contribution rate increases that went into effect during plan years beginning after December 31, 2014 would be disregarded: The $5.51 contribution rate in effect at the end of plan year 2014 would be held steady in computing Employer A's required contributions for the plan years included in the numerator of the allocation fraction. Based on 4.3 million contribution base units, this results in total required contributions of $23.7 million over 5 years. Absent section 305(g)(3) of ERISA, the sum of the contributions required to be made by Employer A would have been determined by multiplying Employer A's contribution rate in effect for each plan year by the contribution base units in that plan year, producing total required contributions of $28.96 million over 5 years.
Example 2. Determining the Denominator of the Allocation Fraction Using the Proxy Group Method (§ 4211.14(d)).
Assume a plan covers ten employers. For 2017, three small employers were in rate history group X, representing less than 5 percent of active plan participants; employers A and B and two other employers were in rate history group Y; and employer C and two other employers were in rate history group Z. For 2018, there were changes in contribution rates for some of B's employees, and as a result, employer B is being treated as two employers, B1 and B2. B1 remained in rate history group Y because, while B1 has a significantly lower contribution rate than A, the contributions of both are subject to the same percentage increase each year. B2 was added to rate history group X. X continues to represent less than 5 percent of active plan participants, and the plan continues to ignore it in forming the proxy group. The plan forms a 2018 proxy group of three employers—A and B1 from rate history group Y and C from rate history group Z—that together represent more than 10 percent of active plan participants.
Contributions for 2018 are $1,000,000: $20,000 for rate history group X, $740,000 for rate history group Y, and $240,000 for rate history group Z, with A and B1 accounting for $150,000 and C accounting for $45,000 of the total contribution amounts.
Contribution rates for 2018 for A, B1, and C (excluding rate increases required to be disregarded for withdrawal liability purposes) and contribution base units for the three employers are: For A, 87 cents and 100,000 CBUs; for B1, 43 cents and 50,000 CBUs; and for C, 70 cents and 60,000 CBUs, as shown in rows (1) and (2) of the table below. Thus, the three employers' adjusted contributions are $87,000, $21,500, and $42,000 respectively, as shown in row (3).
Moving from the employer level to the rate history group level, the adjusted contributions for employers in the proxy group that are in the same rate history group are added together (row (4)). Those totals are then divided by total actual contributions for the proxy group employers in each rate history group (row (6)) to derive an adjustment factor for each rate history group (row (7)) that is applied to the actual contributions of all employers in the rate history group (row (8)) to get the adjusted contributions for each rate history group represented in the proxy group (row (9)).
Moving from the rate history group level to the plan level, the same process is repeated. Adjusted employer contributions for the rate history group are summed (row (10)) and divided by the total contributions for all rate history groups represented in the proxy group (row (11)) to get an adjustment factor for the plan (row (12)). Contributions for rate history group X are excluded from row (11) because no employer in rate history group X is in the proxy group. The adjustment factor for the plan is then applied to total plan contributions (row (13)) to get adjusted plan contributions (row (14)). Contributions for rate history group X are included in row (13) because—although X was ignored in determining the adjustment factor for the plan — the adjustment factor applies to all plan contributions (other than those by employers excluded from the plan's allocation fraction denominator). The plan will use the adjusted plan contributions in row (14) as the total contributions for 2018 in determining the denominator of any allocation fraction that includes contributions for 2018.

# Subpart A—General
§ 4219.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Subpart A.
Subpart A of this part describes the purpose and scope of the
provisions in this part and defined terms used in this part. Section 4219(c) of ERISA requires a withdrawn employer to make annual withdrawal liability payments at a set rate over the number of years necessary to amortize its withdrawal liability, generally limited to a period of 20 years. This subpart provides rules for disregarding certain contribution increases in determining the highest contribution rate under section 4219(c) of ERISA.
(b)
Subpart B
—(1)
Purpose.
When a multiemployer plan terminates by the withdrawal of every employer from the plan, or when substantially all employers withdraw from a multiemployer plan pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw from the plan, section 4219(c)(1)(D)(i) of ERISA requires that the liability of such withdrawing employers be determined (or redetermined) without regard to the 20-year limitation on annual payments established in section 4219(c)(1)(B) of ERISA. In addition, section 4219(c)(1)(D)(ii) requires that, upon the occurrence of a withdrawal described above, the total unfunded vested benefits of the plan be fully allocated among such withdrawing employers in a manner that is not inconsistent with PBGC regulations. Section 4209(c) of ERISA provides that the
de minimis
reduction established in sections 4209 (a) and (b) of ERISA does not apply to an employer that withdraws in a plan year in which substantially all employers withdraw from the plan, or to an employer that withdraws pursuant to an agreement to withdraw during a period of one or more plan years during which substantially all employers withdraw pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw. The purpose of subpart B of this part is to prescribe rules, pursuant to sections 4219(c)(1)(D) and 4209(c) of ERISA, for redetermining an employer's withdrawal liability and fully allocating the unfunded vested benefits of a multiemployer plan in either of two mass-withdrawal situations: the termination of a plan by the withdrawal of every employer and the withdrawal of substantially all employers pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw. Subpart B also prescribes rules for redetermining the liability of an employer without regard to section 4209 (a) or (b) when the employer withdraws in a plan year in which substantially all employers withdraw, regardless of the occurrence of a mass withdrawal. (See part 4281 regarding the valuation of unfunded vested benefits to be fully allocated under subpart B, and parts 4041A and 4281 regarding the powers and duties of the plan sponsor of a plan terminated by mass withdrawal.)
(2)
Scope.
Subpart B applies to multiemployer plans covered by title IV of ERISA, with respect to which there is a termination by the withdrawal of every employer (including a plan created by a partition pursuant to section 4233 of ERISA) or a withdrawal of substantially all employers in the plan pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw from the plan, and to employers that withdraw from such multiemployer plans. The obligations of a plan sponsor of a mass-withdrawal-terminated plan under subpart B cease to apply when the plan assets are distributed in full satisfaction of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan. Subpart B also applies, to the extent appropriate, to multiemployer plans with respect to which there is a withdrawal of substantially all employers in a single plan year and to employers that withdraw from such plans in that plan year.
(c)
Subpart C.
Subpart C establishes the interest rate to be charged on overdue, defaulted and overpaid withdrawal liability under section 4219(c)(6) of ERISA, and authorizes multiemployer plans to adopt alternative rules concerning assessment of interest and related matters. Subpart C applies to multiemployer plans covered under title IV of ERISA, and to employers that have withdrawn from such plans on or after September 26, 1980, except employers with respect to which section 4221(f) or section 4221(g) of ERISA applies (provided that such employers are in compliance with the provisions of those sections, as applicable).
[61 FR 34102, July 1, 1996, as amended at 73 FR 79636, Dec. 30, 2008; 86 FR 1277, Jan. 8, 2021]
§ 4219.2
Definitions.
(a) The following terms are defined in § 4001.2 of this chapter: employer,

[61 FR 34102, July 1, 1996, as amended at 73 FR 79636, Dec. 30, 2008; 86 FR 1277, Jan. 8, 2021]
§ 4219.3
Disregarding certain contributions.
(a)
General rule.
For purposes of determining the highest contribution rate under section 4219(c) of ERISA, a plan must disregard:
(1)
Surcharge.
Any surcharge under section 305(e)(7) of ERISA and section 432(e)(7) of the Code the obligation for which accrues on or after December 31, 2014.
(2)
Contribution increase.
Any increase in the contribution rate or other increase in contribution requirements that goes into effect during a plan year beginning after December 31, 2014, so that a plan may meet the requirements of a funding improvement plan under section 305(c) of ERISA and section 432(c) of the Code or a rehabilitation plan under section 305(e) of ERISA and section 432(e) of the Code, except to the extent that one of the following exceptions applies pursuant to section 305(g)(3) of ERISA and section 432(g)(3) of the Code:
(i) The increases in contribution requirements are due to increased levels of work, employment, or periods for which compensation is provided.
(ii) The additional contributions are used to provide an increase in benefits, including an increase in future benefit accruals, permitted by section 305(d)(1)(B) or (f)(1)(B) of ERISA and section 432(d)(1)(B) or (f)(1)(B) of the Code.
(b)
Simplified method for a plan that is no longer in endangered or critical status.
A plan sponsor may amend a plan without PBGC approval to use the simplified method in this paragraph (b) for purposes of determining the highest contribution rate for a plan that is no longer in endangered or critical status. The highest contribution rate is the greater of—
(1) The employer's contribution rate as of the date that is the later of the last day of the first plan year that ends on or after December 31, 2014 and the last day of the plan year the employer first contributes to the plan (the “employer freeze date”) plus any contribution increases after the employer freeze date, and before the employer's withdrawal date that are determined in accordance with the rules under § 4219.3(a)(2)(ii); or
(2) The highest contribution rate for any plan year after the plan year that includes the expiration date of the first collective bargaining agreement of the withdrawing employer requiring plan contributions that expires after the plan is no longer in endangered or critical status, or, if earlier, the date as of which the withdrawing employer renegotiated a contribution rate effective after the plan year the plan is no longer in endangered or critical status.
(c)
Example:
The simplified method in paragraph (b) of this section is illustrated by the following example.
(1)
Facts.
A contributing employer withdraws in plan year 2028, after the 2027 expiration date of the first collective bargaining agreement requiring plan contributions that expires after the plan is no longer in critical status in plan year 2026. The plan sponsor determines that under the expiring collective bargaining agreement the employer's $4.50 hourly contribution rate in plan year 2014 was required to increase each year to $7.00 per hour in plan year 2025, to enable the plan to meet its rehabilitation plan. The plan sponsor determines that, over this period, a cumulative increase of $0.85 per hour was used to fund benefit increases, as provided by plan amendment. Under a new collective bargaining agreement effective in 2027, the employer's hourly contribution rate is reduced to $5.00.
(2)
Highest contribution rate.
The plan sponsor determines that the employer's highest contribution rate for purposes of section 4219(c) of ERISA is $5.35, because it is the greater of the highest rate in effect after the plan is no longer in critical status ($5.00) and the employer's contribution rate in plan year 2014 ($4.50) plus any increases between 2015 and 2025 ($0.85) that were required to be taken into account under section 305(g)(3) of ERISA.
(d)
Effective and applicability dates
—(1)
Effective date.
This section is effective on February 8, 2021.
(2)
Applicability date.
This section applies to employer withdrawals from multiemployer plans that occur in plan years beginning on or after February 8, 2021.

# Subpart B—Redetermination of Withdrawal Liability Upon Mass Withdrawal
§ 4219.11
Withdrawal liability upon mass withdrawal.
(a)
Initial withdrawal liability.
The plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan that experiences a mass withdrawal shall determine initial withdrawal liability pursuant to section 4201 of ERISA of every employer that has completely or partially withdrawn from the plan and for whom the liability has not previously been determined and, in accordance with section 4202 of ERISA, notify each employer of the amount of the initial withdrawal liability and collect the amount of the initial withdrawal liability from each employer.
(b)
Mass withdrawal liability.
The plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan that experiences a mass withdrawal shall also—
(1) Notify withdrawing employers, in accordance with § 4219.16(a), that a mass withdrawal has occurred;
(2) Within 150 days after the mass withdrawal valuation date, determine the liability of withdrawn employers for
de minimis
amounts and for 20-year-limitation amounts in accordance with §§ 4219.13 and 4219.14;
(3) Within one year after the reallocation record date, determine the reallocation liability of withdrawn employers in accordance with § 4219.15;
(4) Notify each withdrawing employer of the amount of mass withdrawal liability determined pursuant to this subpart and the schedule for payment of such liability, and demand payment of and collect that liability, in accordance with § 4219.16; and
(5) Notify the PBGC of the occurrence of a mass withdrawal and certify, in accordance with § 4219.17, that determinations of mass withdrawal liability have been completed.
(c)
Extensions of time.
The plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan that experiences a mass withdrawal may apply to the PBGC for an extension of the deadlines contained in paragraph (b) of this section. The PBGC shall approve such a request only if it finds that failure to grant the extension will create
an unreasonable risk of loss to plan participants or the PBGC.
§ 4219.12
Employers liable upon mass withdrawal.
(a)
Liability for de minimis amounts.
An employer shall be liable for
de minimis
amounts to the extent provided in section 4219(c)(1)(D) of ERISA if the employer's initial withdrawal liability was reduced pursuant to section 4209 (a) or (b) of ERISA.
(b)
Liability for 20-year-limitation amounts.
An employer shall be liable for 20-year-limitation amounts to the extent provided in section 4219(c)(1)(D) of ERISA.
(c)
Liability for reallocation liability.
An employer shall be liable for reallocation liability if the employer withdrew pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw from a multiemployer plan from which substantially all employers withdrew pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw, or if the employer withdrew after the beginning of the second full plan year preceding the termination date from a plan that terminated by the withdrawal of every employer, and, as of the reallocation record date—
(1) The employer has not been completely liquidated or dissolved;
(2) The employer is not the subject of a case or proceeding under title 11, United States Code, or any case or proceeding under similar provisions of state insolvency laws, except that a plan sponsor may determine that such an employer is liable for reallocation liability if the plan sponsor determines that the employer is reasonably expected to be able to pay its initial withdrawal liability and its redetermination liability in full and on time to the plan; and
(3) The plan sponsor has not determined that the employer's initial withdrawal liability or its redetermination liability is limited by section 4225 of ERISA.
(d)
General exclusion.
In the event that a plan experiences successive mass withdrawals, an employer that has been determined to be liable under this subpart for any component of mass withdrawal liability shall not be liable as a result of the same withdrawal for that component of mass withdrawal liability with respect to a subsequent mass withdrawal.
(e)
Free-look rule.
An employer that is not liable for initial withdrawal liability pursuant to a plan amendment adopting section 4210(a) of ERISA shall not be liable for
de minimis
amounts or for 20-year-limitation amounts, but shall be liable for reallocation liability in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(f)
Payment of initial withdrawal liability.
An employer's payment of its total initial withdrawal liability, whether by prepayment or otherwise, for a withdrawal which is later determined to be part of a mass withdrawal shall not exclude the employer from or otherwise limit the employer's mass withdrawal liability under this subpart.
(g)
Agreement presumed.
Withdrawal by an employer during a period of three consecutive plan years within which substantially all employers withdraw from a plan shall be presumed to be a withdrawal pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw unless the employer proves otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.
§ 4219.13
Amount of liability for
de minimis
amounts.
An employer that is liable for
de minimis
amounts shall be liable to the plan for the amount by which the employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits for the purpose of determining its initial withdrawal liability was reduced pursuant to section 4209 (a) or (b) of ERISA. Any liability for
de minimis
amounts determined under this section shall be limited by section 4225 of ERISA to the extent that section would have been limiting had the employer's initial withdrawal liability been determined without regard to the
de minimis
reduction.
§ 4219.14
Amount of liability for 20-year-limitation amounts.
An employer that is liable for 20-year-limitation amounts shall be liable to the plan for an amount equal to the present value of all initial withdrawal liability payments for which the employer was not liable pursuant to section 4219(c)(1)(B) of ERISA. The present value of such payments shall be determined as of the end of the plan year
preceding the plan year in which the employer withdrew, using the assumptions that were used to determine the employer's payment schedule for initial withdrawal liability pursuant to section 4219(c)(1)(A)(ii) of ERISA. Any liability for 20-year-limitation amounts determined under this section shall be limited by section 4225 of ERISA to the extent that section would have been limiting had the employer's initial withdrawal liability been determined without regard to the 20-year limitation.
§ 4219.15
Determination of reallocation liability.
(a)
General rule.
In accordance with the rules in this section, the plan sponsor shall determine the amount of unfunded vested benefits to be reallocated and shall fully allocate those unfunded vested benefits among all employers liable for reallocation liability.
(b)
Amount of unfunded vested benefits to be reallocated.
For purposes of this section, the amount of a plan's unfunded vested benefits to be reallocated shall be the amount of the plan's unfunded vested benefits, determined as of the mass withdrawal valuation date, adjusted to exclude from plan assets the value of the plan's claims for unpaid initial withdrawal liability and unpaid redetermination liability that are deemed to be uncollectible under § 4219.12(c)(1) or (c)(2).
(c)
Amount of reallocation liability.
An employer's reallocation liability shall be equal to the sum of the employer's initial allocable share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits, as determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, plus any unassessable amounts allocated to the employer under paragraph (c)(2), limited by section 4225 of ERISA to the extent that section would have been limiting had the employer's reallocation liability been included in the employer's initial withdrawal liability. If a plan is determined to have no unfunded vested benefits to be reallocated, the reallocation liability of each liable employer shall be zero.
(1)
Initial allocable share.
Except as otherwise provided in rules adopted by the plan pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, and in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, an employer's initial allocable share shall be equal to the product of the plan's unfunded vested benefits to be reallocated, multiplied by a fraction—
(i) The numerator of which is the yearly average of the employer's contribution base units during the three plan years preceding the employer's withdrawal; and
(ii) The denominator of which is the sum of the yearly averages calculated under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section for each employer liable for reallocation liability.
(2)
Allocation of unassessable amounts.
If after computing each employer's initial allocable share of unfunded vested benefits, the plan sponsor knows that any portion of an employer's initial allocable share is unassessable as withdrawal liability because of the limitations in section 4225 of ERISA, the plan sponsor shall allocate any such unassessable amounts among all other liable employers. This allocation shall be done by prorating the unassessable amounts on the basis of each such employer's initial allocable share. No employer shall be liable for unfunded vested benefits allocated under paragraph (c)(1) or this paragraph to another employer that are determined to be unassessable or uncollectible subsequent to the plan sponsor's demand for payment of reallocation liability.
(3)
Contribution base unit.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a contribution base unit means a unit with respect to which an employer has an obligation to contribute, such as an hour worked or shift worked or a unit of production, under the applicable collective bargaining agreement (or other agreement pursuant to which the employer contributes) or with respect to which the employer would have an obligation to contribute if the contribution requirement with respect to the plan were greater than zero.
(d)
Plan rules.
Plans may adopt rules for calculating an employer's initial allocable share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits in a manner other than that prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that those rules allocate the plan's unfunded vested benefits to substantially the same extent the prescribed rules would. Plan rules adopted under this paragraph
shall operate and be applied uniformly with respect to each employer. If such rules would increase the reallocation liability of any employer, they may be effective with respect to that employer earlier than three full plan years after their adoption only if the employer consents to the application of the rules to itself. The plan sponsor shall give a written notice to each contributing employer and each employee organization that represents employees covered by the plan of the adoption of plan rules under this paragraph.
[61 FR 34102, July 1, 1996, as amended at 73 FR 79636, Dec. 30, 2008]
§ 4219.16
Imposition of liability.
(a)
Notice of mass withdrawal.
Within 30 days after the mass withdrawal valuation date, the plan sponsor shall give written notice of the occurrence of a mass withdrawal to each employer that the plan sponsor reasonably expects may be a liable employer under § 4219.12. The notice shall include—
(1) The mass withdrawal valuation date;
(2) A description of the consequences of a mass withdrawal under this subpart; and
(3) A statement that each employer obligated to make initial withdrawal liability payments shall continue to make those payments in accordance with its schedule. Failure of the plan sponsor to notify an employer of a mass withdrawal as required by this paragraph shall not cancel the employer's mass withdrawal liability or waive the plan's claim for such liability.
(b)
Notice of redetermination liability.
Within 30 days after the date as of which the plan sponsor is required under § 4219.11(b)(2) to have determined the redetermination liability of employers, the plan sponsor shall issue a notice of redetermination liability in writing to each employer liable under § 4219.12 for
de minimis
amounts or 20-year-limitation amounts, or both. The notice shall include—
(1) The amount of the employer's liability, if any, for
de minimis
amounts determined pursuant to § 4219.13;
(2) The amount of the employer's liability, if any, for 20-year-limitation amounts determined pursuant to § 4219.14;
(3) The schedule for payment of the liability determined under paragraph (f) of this section;
(4) A demand for payment of the liability in accordance with the schedule; and
(5) A statement of when the plan sponsor expects to issue notices of reallocation liability to liable employers.
(c)
Notice of reallocation liability.
Within 30 days after the date as of which the plan sponsor is required under § 4219.11(b)(3) to have determined the reallocation liability of employers, the plan sponsor shall issue a notice of reallocation liability in writing to each employer liable for reallocation liability. The notice shall include—
(1) The amount of the employer's reallocation liability determined pursuant to § 4219.15;
(2) The schedule for payment of the liability determined under paragraph (f) of this section; and
(3) A demand for payment of the liability in accordance with the schedule.
(d)
Notice to employers not liable.
The plan sponsor shall notify in writing any employer that receives a notice of mass withdrawal under paragraph (a) of this section and subsequently is determined not to be liable for mass withdrawal liability or any component thereof. The notice shall specify the liability from which the employer is excluded and shall be provided to the employer not later than the date by which liable employers are to be provided notices of reallocation liability pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. If the employer is not liable for mass withdrawal liability, the notice shall also include a statement, if applicable, that the employer is obligated to continue to make initial withdrawal liability payments in accordance with its existing schedule for payment of such liability.
(e)
Combined notices.
A plan sponsor may combine a notice of redetermination liability with the notice of and demand for payment of initial withdrawal liability. If a mass withdrawal and a withdrawal described in § 4219.18 occur concurrently, a plan sponsor may combine—
(1) A notice of mass withdrawal with a notice of withdrawal issued pursuant to § 4219.18(d); and
(2) A notice of redetermination liability with a notice of liability issued pursuant to § 4219.18(e).
(f)
Payment schedules.
The plan sponsor shall establish payment schedules for payment of an employer's mass withdrawal liability in accordance with the rules in section 4219(c) of ERISA, as modified by this paragraph. For an employer that owes initial withdrawal liability as of the mass withdrawal valuation date, the plan sponsor shall establish new payment schedules for each element of mass withdrawal liability by amending the initial withdrawal liability payment schedule in accordance with the paragraph (f)(1) of this section. For all other employers, the payment schedules shall be established in accordance with paragraph (f)(2).
(1)
Employers owing initial withdrawal liability as of mass withdrawal valuation date.
For an employer that owes initial withdrawal liability as of the mass withdrawal valuation date, the plan sponsor shall amend the existing schedule of payments in order to amortize the new amounts of liability being assessed,
i.e.,
redetermination liability and reallocation liability. With respect to redetermination liability, the plan sponsor shall add that liability to the total initial withdrawal liability and determine a new payment schedule, in accordance with section 4219(c)(1) of ERISA, using the interest assumptions that were used to determine the original payment schedule. For reallocation liability, the plan sponsor shall add that liability to the present value, as of the date following the mass withdrawal valuation date, of the unpaid portion of the amended payment schedule described in the preceding sentence and determine a new payment schedule of level annual payments, calculated as if the first payment were made on the day following the mass withdrawal valuation date using the interest assumptions used for determining the amount of unfunded vested benefits to be reallocated.
(2)
Other employers.
For an employer that had no initial withdrawal liability, or had fully paid its liability prior to the mass withdrawal valuation date, the plan sponsor shall determine the payment schedule for redetermination liability, in accordance with section 4219(c)(1) of ERISA, in the same manner and using the same interest assumptions as were used or would have been used in determining the payment schedule for the employer's initial withdrawal liability. With respect to reallocation liability, the plan sponsor shall follow the rules prescribed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(g)
Review of mass withdrawal liability determinations.
Determinations of mass withdrawal liability made pursuant to this subpart shall be subject to plan review under section 4219(b)(2) of ERISA and to arbitration under section 4221 of ERISA within the times prescribed by those sections. Matters that relate solely to the amount of, and schedule of payments for, an employer's initial withdrawal liability are not matters relating to the employer's liability under this subpart and are not subject to review pursuant to this paragraph.
(h)
Cessation of withdrawal liability obligations.
If the plan sponsor of a terminated plan distributes plan assets in full satisfaction of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan, the plan sponsor's obligation to impose and collect liability, and each employer's obligation to pay liability, in accordance with this subpart ceases on the date of such distribution.
(i)
Determination that a mass withdrawal has not occurred.
If a plan sponsor determines, after imposing mass withdrawal liability pursuant to this subpart, that a mass withdrawal has not occurred, the plan sponsor shall refund to employers all payments of mass withdrawal liability with interest, except that a plan sponsor shall not refund payments of liability for
de minimis
amounts to an employer that remains liable for such amounts under § 4219.18. Interest shall be credited at the interest rate prescribed in subpart C and shall accrue from the date the payment was received by the plan until the date of the refund.
