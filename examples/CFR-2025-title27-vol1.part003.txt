§ 24.304
Chaptalization (Brix adjustment) and amelioration record.
(a)
General.
A proprietor who chaptalizes juice or ameliorates juice or wine, or both, shall maintain a record of the operation and the transaction date. Records will be maintained for each kind of wine produced (grape, apple, strawberry, etc.). No form of record is prescribed, but the record maintained will contain the information necessary to enable appropriate TTB officers to readily determine compliance with chaptalization and amelioration limitations. All quantities will be recorded in wine gallons, and, where sugar is used, the quantity will be determined either by measuring the increase in volume or, for pure dry sugar by considering that each 13.5 pounds results in a volumetric increase of one gallon. If grape juice is chaptalized and subsequently this juice or wine is ameliorated, the quantity of pure dry sugar added to juice will be included as ameliorating material. If fruit juice other than grape is chaptalized and this juice or wine is ameliorated, the quantity of pure dry sugar added for chaptalization is not considered ameliorating material; however, if liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup is used, the quantity of water in such sugar is included as ameliorating material. The record will include the following:
(1) The volume of juice (exclusive of pulp) deposited in fermenters;
(2) The maximum volume of ameliorating material to which the juice is entitled, as provided in § 24.178;
(3) The volume of ameliorating or chaptalizing material used; and
(4) The volume of material authorized but not yet used.
(b)
Supporting records.
The amelioration record will show the basis for entries and calculations, including determination of the natural fixed acid level and total solids content of juice, as applicable. The records are maintained on the basis of annual accounting periods, with each period commencing on July 1 of a year and ending on the following June 30, except the record for an accounting period may be continued after June 30, where the juice or wine included therein is to be held after that date for completion. When the amelioration of wine included in the record for one accounting period is complete, the record is closed and any unused ameliorating material may not be used. The proprietor may mix wines before amelioration of the wine is completed; however, the proprietor shall additionally maintain records necessary to establish the quantity of unused authorized material to which the resultant mixture would be entitled so that appropriate TTB officers may
readily ascertain compliance with amelioration limitations.

§ 24.331
Wine eligible for the hard cider tax rate.
A wine removed on or after January 1, 2017 is eligible for the hard cider tax rate listed in § 24.270 if:
(a) It contains no more than 0.64 gram of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters of wine;
(b) It is derived primarily from apples or pears, or from apple juice concentrate or pear juice concentrate and water, as described in § 24.332(a);
(c) It contains no fruit product or fruit flavoring other than apple or pear, as described in § 24.332(b) and (c); and
(d) It contains at least one-half of 1 percent and less than 8.5 percent alcohol by volume.
(Sec. 335, Pub. L. 114-113, 129 Stat. 3109, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5041))
§ 24.332
Hard cider materials.
This section pertains to wine that is eligible for the hard cider tax rate as set out in § 24.331.
(a)
Apples and pears.
Wine will be considered to be derived primarily from apples or pears, or from apple juice concentrate or pear juice concentrate and water, if the apple juice, pear juice, or combination of apple and pear juice, or the equivalent amount of concentrate of apple and/or pear juice reconstituted to the original brix of the juice prior to concentration, or any combination thereof, represents more than 50 percent of the volume of the finished product.
(b)
Fruit products.
(1) Wine is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate if it contains any fruit product other than apple or pear. A fruit product is any material derived or made from any fruit or part of a fruit, including but not limited to, concentrates, extracts, juices, powders, or wine spirits.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 24.332(b)(1), an authorized wine treating material set forth in § 24.246 that is derived from a fruit other than apple or pear may be used in the production of wine otherwise eligible for the hard cider tax rate if it is used for a purpose other than flavoring and it is either used in accordance with the wine treating materials provisions of § 24.246 (if used in a natural wine), or used in amounts insufficient to impart a fruit flavor other than apple or pear (if used in a special natural wine or other than standard wine). In determining whether the use of wine treating materials derived from a fruit other than apple or pear is for a purpose other than flavoring, TTB will consider such factors as the labeling and advertising of the product. Any written or pictorial reference to a material derived from a fruit other than apple or pear (other than the inclusion of a wine treating material in an ingredient labeling statement) in the labeling or advertising of a wine will be treated as evidence that the wine treating material was added for the purpose of flavoring the wine.
(c)
Flavorings.
Wine is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate if it contains any fruit flavoring other than apple or pear. For purposes of this section, a fruit flavoring other than apple or pear is any flavoring that imparts the flavor of a fruit other than apple or pear and includes a natural fruit flavor, an artificial fruit flavor, and a natural flavor that artificially imparts the flavor of a fruit that is not contained in that flavor. In determining whether the use of a flavoring imparts the flavor of a fruit other than apple or pear, TTB will consider such factors as the labeling and advertising of the product. Any written or pictorial reference to a fruit flavor other than apple or pear in the labeling or advertising of a wine that contains a flavoring will be treated as evidence that the wine contains a flavoring that imparts a fruit flavor other than apple or pear and thus the wine is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate. The use of spices, honey, hops, or pumpkins as a flavoring will not make a wine ineligible for the hard cider tax rate.

# Standards for Beer
§ 25.15
Materials for the production of beer.
(a) Beer must be brewed from malt or from substitutes for malt. Only rice, grain of any kind, bran, glucose, sugar, and molasses are substitutes for malt. In addition, you may also use the following materials as adjuncts in fermenting beer: honey, fruit, fruit juice, fruit concentrate, herbs, spices, and other food materials.
(b) You may use flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol in producing beer. Flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol may contribute no more than 49% of the overall alcohol content of the finished beer. For example, a finished beer that contains 5.0% alcohol by volume must derive a minimum of 2.55% alcohol by volume from the fermentation of ingredients at the brewery and may derive not more than 2.45% alcohol by volume from the addition of flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol. In the case of beer with an alcohol content of more than 6% by volume, no more than 1.5% of the volume of the beer may consist of alcohol derived from added flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol.

A bond may be executed by two or more corporate sureties. Each corporate surety may limit its liability in terms on the face of the bond in a specified amount. This amount may not exceed the limitations set forth for corporate security by the Secretary which are set forth in the current revision of Treasury Department Circular 570. The sum
of the liabilities for the sureties will equal the required penal sum of the bond.
(e)
Deposit of collateral securities in lieu of corporate surety.
Bonds or notes of the United States, or other obligations which are unconditionally guaranteed as to both interest and principal by the United States, may be pledged and deposited by principals as collateral security in lieu of corporate surety in accordance with 31 CFR part 225.
(f)
Bond guaranteed by deposit of cash or cash equivalent.
As an alternative to the corporate surety bond under paragraph (b) of this section, a person can file a bond that guarantees payment of the liability by submitting cash or its equivalent (including a money order, cashier's check, or personal check). Cash or its equivalent must be no less than the penal sums of the required bonds. Bonds described in this paragraph will be released if there are no outstanding liabilities when the bond is terminated. Cash equivalents must be payable to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.

# Subpart I—Dealer Registration and Recordkeeping

# Source:
T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37404, July 28, 2009, unless otherwise noted.
§ 25.111
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
Dealer.
A person who sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product (distilled spirits, wines, and/or beer) fit for beverage use.
Retail dealer in liquors.
A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, distilled spirits, wines, or beer to any person other than a dealer.
Wholesale dealer in liquors.
A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, distilled
spirits, wines, or beer to another dealer.
(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122)
§ 25.112
Dealer registration.
Every brewer who sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product (distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register as a dealer in accordance with part 31 of this chapter. However, the Brewer's Notice, TTB Form 5130.10, filed under subpart G of this part, and approval of that notice by the appropriate TTB officer, will constitute the brewer's registration as a dealer at the brewery. Every brewer registered as a dealer under this subpart will be classified as a wholesale dealer in liquors (see § 31.32 of this chapter) and as such may also operate as a retail dealer in liquors without additional registration. Registration covers all sales from the same location, including sales of wine, spirits, or other brewers' beer. As provided in § 31.52 of this chapter, the brewer is subject to no additional registration for making sales of wine or beer at the customer's place of business. Otherwise, a brewer who conducts business as a dealer at a location other than the brewery must register and keep records in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.
(26 U.S.C. 5124)
§ 25.113
Amending the dealer registration.
Every brewer registered as a dealer under this subpart must maintain a current and accurate Brewer's Notice, TTB Form 5130.10. Whenever there is a change to any of the information provided in the approved Brewer's Notice, the brewer must amend the notice within the time period specified in subpart G of this part. An amendment to the Brewer's Notice, Form 5130.10, will also serve as an amendment of the brewer's dealer registration under this subpart. The brewer's dealer registration will also terminate when brewery operations under the Brewer's Notice terminate.
(26 U.S.C. 5124)
§ 25.114
Dealer records.
Every dealer is required to maintain records of transactions. Beer transactions that appear in the records required by subpart U of this part will meet the brewer's recordkeeping requirements as a dealer. For other transactions not covered in the brewery records, such as retail sales of wine or distilled spirits in a restaurant at the brewery, or operations as a wholesale dealer in wine or distilled spirits, the brewer must keep the records specified for dealers in part 31 of this chapter.
(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122)

# Subpart J—Marks, Brands, and Labels
§ 25.141
Barrels and kegs.
(a)
General requirements.
The brewer's name or trade name and the place of production (city and, if necessary for identification, State) shall be permanently marked on each barrel or keg. If the place of production is clearly shown on the bung or on the tap cover, or on a label securely affixed to each barrel or keg, the place of production need not be permanently marked on each barrel or keg. No statement as to payment of internal revenue taxes may be shown.
(b)
Breweries of same ownership.
(1) If two or more breweries are owned or operated by the same person, firm, or corporation (as defined in § 25.181), the place of production:
(i) May be shown as the only location on the bung, or on the tap cover, or on a separate label attached to the keg;
(ii) May be included in a listing of the locations of breweries qualified under this part if the place of production is not given less emphasis than any of the other locations; or
(iii) Need not be shown if the brewer's principal place of business is shown in lieu of any other location. The brewer's principal place of business will be the location of a brewery operated by the brewer and qualified under this part.
(2) If the location of two or more breweries is shown on the keg, bung, tap cover, or on a separate label attached to the keg (paragraph (b)(1)(ii)), or if the brewer's principal place of business is shown in lieu of the actual place of production (paragraph
(b)(1)(iii)), the brewer shall indicate the actual place of production by printing, coding or other markings on the keg, bung, tap cover, or on a separate label attached to the keg. The coding system employed will permit an appropriate TTB officer to determine the place of production (including street address if two or more breweries are located in the same city) of the beer. The brewer must notify the appropriate TTB officer prior to employing a coding system.
(c)
Label approval required.
Labels or tap covers used by brewers shall be covered by certificates of label approval, Form 5100.31, when required by part 7 of this chapter.

Label requirements.
Each bottle of beer shall show by label or otherwise the name or trade name of the brewer, the net contents of the bottle, the nature of the product such as beer, ale, porter, stout, etc., and the place of production (city and, when necessary for identification, State). No statement as to payment of internal revenue taxes may be shown.
(b)
Breweries of same ownership.
(1) If two or more breweries are owned or operated by the same person, firm, or corporation (as defined in § 25.181), the place of production:
(i) May be shown as the only location on the label;
(ii) May be included in a listing of the locations of breweries qualified under this part if the place of production is not given less emphasis than any of the other locations; or
(iii) Need not be shown if the brewer's principal place of business is shown in lieu of any other location. The brewer's principal place of business will be the location of a brewery operated by the brewer and qualified under this part.
(2) If the location of two or more breweries is shown on the label (paragraph (b)(1)(ii)), or if the brewer's principal place of business is shown on the label in lieu of the actual place of production (paragraph (b)(1)(iii)), the brewer shall indicate the actual place of production by printing, coding or other markings on the label, bottle, crown or lid. The coding system employed will permit an appropriate TTB officer to determine the place of production (including street address if two or more breweries are located in the same city) of the beer. The brewer must notify the appropriate TTB officer prior to employing a coding system.
(c)
Distinctive names.
If the brewer's name, trade name or brand name includes the name of a city which is not the place where the beer was produced, the appropriate TTB officer may require the brewer to state the actual place of production on the label.
(d)
Tolerances.
The statement of net contents shall indicate exactly the volume of beer within the bottle except for variations in measuring as may occur in filling conducted in compliance with good commercial practice. The barrel equivalent of bottles filled during a consecutive three month period, calculated on the basis of the brewer's fill test records, may not vary more than 0.5 percent from the barrel equivalent of bottles filled during the same period, calculated on the basis of the stated net contents of the bottles. The brewer is liable for the tax on the entire amount of beer removed, without benefit of tolerance, when the fill of bottles and cans exceeds the tolerance for the three month period, or when filling is not conducted in compliance with good commercial practice.
(e)
Label approval required.
Labels used by brewers shall be covered by certificates of label approval, Form 5100.31, when required by part 7 of this chapter.
(f)
Short-fill bottles.
A brewer may dispose of taxpaid short-fill bottles of beer to employees for their use but not for
resale. These bottles need not be labeled, but if labeled they need not show an accurate statement of net contents.

# Subpart K—Tax on Beer

# Liability for Tax
§ 25.151
Rate of tax.
All beer, brewed or produced, and removed for consumption or sale, is subject to the tax prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5051, for every barrel containing not more than 31 gallons, and at a like rate
for any other quantity or for the fractional parts of a barrel as authorized in § 25.156.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1333, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5051, 5052))
§ 25.152
Reduced rate of tax for certain brewers.
(a)
General.
Section 5051(a)(2) of Title 26 U.S.C. provides for a reduced rate of tax on the first 60,000 barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale by a brewer during a calendar year. To be eligible to pay the reduced rate of tax, a brewer:
(1) Shall brew or produce the beer at a qualified brewery in the United States;
(2) May not produce more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer per calendar year; and
(3) May not be a member of a “controlled group” of brewers whose members together produce more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer per calendar year.
The appropriate TTB officer shall deny use of the reduced rate of tax provided by 26 U.S.C. 5051(a)(2) where it is determined that the allowance of such a reduced rate would benefit a person who would otherwise fail to qualify for use of such rate.
(b)
Definitions.
For the purpose of determining eligibility for payment of the reduced rate of tax on beer, terms have the following meanings:
(1)
Controlled group.
A related group of brewers as defined in 26 U.S.C. 5051(a)(2)(B). Controlled groups include, but are not limited to:
(i) Parent-subsidiary controlled groups as defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-1(a)(2);
(ii) Brother-sister controlled groups as defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-1(a)(3); and
(iii) Combined groups as defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-1(a)(4). Stock ownership in a corporation need not be direct and 51% constructive ownership, defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-3, may be acquired through:
(A) An option to purchase stock;
(B) Attribution from partnerships;
(C) Attribution from estate or trusts;
(D) Attribution from corporations; or
(E) Ownership by spouses, children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents.
(2)
Production of beer.
The production of beer as recorded in the brewer's daily records and reported in the Brewer's Report of Operations, Form 5130.9. For the purpose of determining compliance with the 2,000,000 barrel limitation, production of beer by a brewer or a controlled group of brewers includes both beer produced at qualified breweries within the United States and beer produced outside the United States.
(c)
Brewers operating more than one brewery.
Brewers who operate more than one brewery shall include the combined production of beer at all their breweries when determining eligibility under the 2,000,000 barrel limitation. The reduced rate of tax applies to the first 60,000 barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale in a calendar year by the brewer; the brewer shall apportion the 60,000 barrels among the breweries in the manner described in the notice as provided by § 25.167(b)(3).
(d)
Controlled groups of brewers.
Members of a controlled group of brewers shall include the combined production of beer by all member brewers when determining eligibility under the 2,000,000 limitation. The reduced rate of tax applies to the first 60,000 barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale in a calendar year by the controlled group of brewers; the controlled group of brewers shall apportion the 60,000 barrels among member brewers in the manner described in each brewer's notice as provided by § 25.167(b)(3).

§ 25.153
Persons liable for tax.
The tax imposed by law on beer (including beer purchased or procured by one brewer from another) shall be paid by the brewer of the beer at the brewery where produced. The tax on beer transferred to a brewery from other breweries owned by the same brewer in accordance with subpart L of this part
shall be paid by the brewer at the brewery from which the beer is removed for consumption or sale.

# Determination of Tax
§ 25.155
Types of containers.
Beer may be removed from a brewery for consumption or sale only in barrels, kegs, bottles, and similar containers, as provided in this part. A container which the appropriate TTB officer determines to be similar to a bottle or can will be treated as a bottle for purposes of this part. A container which the appropriate TTB officer determines to be similar to a barrel or keg and which conforms to one of the sizes prescribed for barrels or kegs in § 25.156 will be treated as such for purposes of this part.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1389, as amended, 1390, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5412, 5416))
§ 25.156
Determination of tax on keg beer.
(a) In determining the tax on beer removed in kegs, a barrel is regarded as a quantity of not more than 31 gallons. The authorized fractional parts of a barrel are whole barrels, halves, thirds, quarters, sixths, and eighths, and beer may be removed in kegs rated at those capacities. The following keg sizes are also authorized at the stated barrel equivalents:
Size of keg
Barrel equivalent
5 gallons
0.16129
30 liter
0.25565
50 liter
0.42608
(b) If any barrel or authorized size keg contains a quantity of beer more than 2 percent in excess of its rated capacity, tax will be determined and paid on the actual quantity of beer (without benefit of any tolerance) contained in the keg.
(c) The quantities of keg beer removed subject to tax will be computed to 5 decimal places. The sum of the quantities computed for any one day will be rounded to 2 decimal places and the tax will be calculated and paid on the rounded sum.

§ 25.159
Time of tax determination and payment; offsets.
(a)
Time and payment.
The tax on beer will be determined at the time of its removal for consumption or sale, and will be paid by return as provided in this part.
(b)
Offsets.
During any business day, the quantity of beer returned to the same brewery from which removed is to be taken as an offset against or deducted from the total quantity of beer removed for consumption or sale from that brewery on the day that the beer is returned.
(c)
Offsets not allowed.
An offset or deduction for returned beer will not be allowed if:
(1) The brewer was indemnified by insurance or otherwise in respect of the tax; or
(2) The brewer does not issue credit to the customer for the tax on the returned beer within 30 days of the return of the beer. If the tax is not timely credited after the offset or deduction is taken, the brewer shall make an increasing adjustment on the next tax return.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1334, as amended, 1335, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5054, 5056, 5061))
§ 25.160
Tax adjustment for brewers who produce more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer.
Each brewer who has paid tax on beer by return, Form 5000.24, at the reduced rate of tax during a calendar year, but whose production (or the production of a controlled group of brewers of which the brewer is a member) exceeds 2,000.000 barrels of beer in that calendar year, is no longer eligible to pay tax on beer at the reduced rate of tax for any beer removed that calendar year for consumption or sale. The brewer shall make a tax adjustment for the payment of additional tax no later than the return period in which production (or the production of a controlled group of brewers of which the brewer is a member) exceeds 2,000,000 barrels of beer. The adjustment will be determined by multiplying the difference between the higher and lower rates of tax applicable to beer by the number of barrels removed by the brewer that year at the reduced rate of tax. The brewer shall make tax adjustments for all breweries where tax was paid at the lower rate that year, and shall include interest payable from the date on which tax was paid at the lower rate. In the case of a controlled group of brewers whose production exceeds 2,000,000 barrels of beer, all member brewers who paid tax at the lower rate shall make tax adjustments as determined in this section.

# Preparation and Remittance of Tax Returns
§ 25.163
Method of tax payment.
A brewer shall pay the tax on beer by return on TTB F 5000.24, as provided in §§ 25.164, 25.164a, 25.173, and 25.175. In paying the tax, a fractional part of a cent will be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which case it will be increased to one cent.
[T.D. ATF-251, 52 FR 19314, May 22, 1987, as amended by T.D. ATF-365, 60 FR 33669, June 28, 1995; T.D. TTB-89, 76 FR 3511, Jan. 20, 2011; T.D. TTB-94, 76 FR 52862, Aug. 24, 2011]
§ 25.164
Deferred payment return periods—annual, quarterly, and semimonthly.
(a)
Requirement for filing.
This section governs payment of tax on a deferred basis. Each brewer must pay the tax on beer (unless prepaid) by return on Form 5000.24. The brewer must file Form 5000.24 as a return regardless of whether tax has been prepaid as provided in § 25.175 during the return period. The brewer must file a return on Form 5000.24 for each return period even though no beer was removed for consumption or sale.
(b)
Payment of tax.
The brewer must include for payment with the return the full amount of tax required to be determined (and which has not been prepaid) on all beer removed for consumption or sale during the period covered by the return.
(c)
Return periods
—(1)
Semimonthly return period.
Except in the case of a taxpayer who qualifies for annual or quarterly return periods as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, all taxpayers must use semimonthly return periods for deferred payment of tax. The semimonthly return periods run from the brewer's business day beginning on the first day of each month through the brewer's business day beginning on the 15th day of that month, and from the brewer's business day beginning on the 16th day of the month through the brewer's business day beginning on the last day of the month, except as otherwise provided in § 25.164a.
(2)
Annual return period.
Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer who reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $1,000 in taxes with respect to beer imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5051 and 7652 in the current calendar year, and that was liable for not more than $1,000 in such taxes in the preceding calendar year, may choose to use an annual return period. However, the taxpayer may not use the annual return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $1,000, and any tax which has not been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the quarterly or semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
(3)
Quarterly return period.
A taxpayer may choose to use a quarterly return period if the taxpayer was not liable for more than $50,000 in taxes with respect to beer imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5051 and 7652 in the preceding calendar year and if that taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in such taxes during the current calendar year. In such a case the last day for paying the tax and filing the return will be the 14th day after the last day of the calendar quarter. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax that has not been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
(4)
Additional rules for annual and quarterly return periods.
The following additional rules apply to the annual and quarterly return period procedure under this section:
(i) A “taxpayer” is an individual, corporation, partnership, or other entity that is assigned a single Employer Identification Number as defined in 26 CFR 301.7701-12;
(ii) “Reasonably expects” means that there is no existing or anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's tax liability to exceed the prescribed limit;
(iii) A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the beer tax liability for all locations to determine eligibility for the return procedures;
(iv) A taxpayer who has both domestic operations and import transactions must combine the beer tax liability on the domestic operations and the imports to determine eligibility for the return procedures;
(v) The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for purposes of determining eligibility for the return procedures. However, a taxpayer who is eligible for the return procedures, and
who is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more in beer excise taxes per year, is required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer (EFT). Payments via EFT must be transmitted in accordance with section 5061(e);
(vi) A new taxpayer is eligible to use the return procedures in the first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $1,000 (in the case of the annual return procedure) or $50,000 (in the case of the quarterly return procedure) in beer taxes during that calendar year; and
(vii) If a taxpayer becomes ineligible to use a return procedure prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section because the taxpayer's liability exceeds $1,000 or $50,000, respectively, during a taxable year, that taxpayer may resume using that return procedure only after a full calendar year has passed during which the taxpayer's liability did not exceed $1,000 or $50,000, as the case may be. A taxpayer may not use an annual or quarterly return procedure during any calendar year in which the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for more than $1,000, in the case of the annual return procedure, or $50,000, in the case of the quarterly return procedure, in beer taxes.
(d)
Time for filing returns and paying tax.
Except as otherwise provided in § 25.164a for semimonthly tax returns, the brewer must file the tax return, TTB F 5000.24, for each return period, and make remittance as required by this section, not later than the 14th day after the last day of the return period. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, except as otherwise provided in § 25.164a(c).
(e)
Timely filing.
(1) When the brewer sends the semimonthly, quarterly, or annual tax return, Form 5000.24, by U.S. mail, in accordance with the instructions on the form, as required by this section, with remittance as provided for in this section, or without remittance as provided for in § 25.165, the date of the official postmark of the United States Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the return and remittance were mailed is considered the date of delivery of the return and the date of delivery of the remittance, if enclosed with the return. When the postmark on the cover is illegible, the burden is on the brewer to prove when the postmark was made.
(2) When the brewer sends the semimonthly, quarterly, or annual return with or without remittance by registered mail or by certified mail, the date of registry or the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt of certified mail will be treated as the date of delivery of the return and of the remittance, if enclosed with the return.

§ 25.164a
Special September rule for taxes due by semimonthly return.
(a)
Division of second semimonthly period.
(1)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the second semimonthly period for the month of September is divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 26th day, and from the 27th day through the 30th day. The brewer shall file a return, TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 16-26, no later than September 29. The brewer shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 27-30, no later than October 14.
(2)
Taxpayment not by electronic fund transfer.
In the case of taxes for which remittance by electronic fund transfer (EFT) is not required by § 25.165, the second semimonthly period of September is divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 25th day, and from the 26th day through the 30th day. The brewer shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 16-25, no later than September 28. The brewer shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 26-30, no later than October 14.
(b)
Amount of payment—Safe harbor rule.
(1)
General.
Taxpayers are considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the amount paid no later than September 29 is not less than 11/15ths (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
(2)
Taxpayment not by EFT.
Taxpayers are considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section if the amount paid no later than September 28 is not less than 2/3rds (66.7 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
(c)
Weekends and holidays.
If the required taxpayment due date for the period September 16-25 or September 16-26, as applicable, falls on a Saturday or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding day. If the required due date falls on a Sunday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately following day.
(d)
Example: Payment of tax for the month of September.
(1)
Facts.
X, a brewer required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer, incurred tax liability in the amount of $30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September. For the period September 16-26, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $45,000, and for the period September 27-30, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $2,000.
(2)
Payment requirement.
X's payment of tax in the amount of $30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September is due no later than September 29 (§ 25.164(d)). X's payment of tax for the period September 16-26 is also due no later than September 29 (§ 25.164a(a)(1)). X may use the safe harbor rule to determine the amount of payment due for the period of September 16-26 (§ 25.164a(b)). Under the safe harbor rule, X's payment of tax must not be less than $21,990.00, that is, 11/15ths of the tax liability incurred during the first semimonthly period of September. Additionally, X must pay the tax in the amount of $2,000 for the period September 27-30 no later than October 14 (§ 25.164a(a)(1)). X must also pay the underpayment of tax, $23,010.00, for the period September 16-26, no later than October 14 (§ 25.164a(b)).

§ 25.165
Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.
(a)
Eligible brewers.
(1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of beer taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of beer taxes by cash, check, or money order, as described in § 25.163, is not authorized for a taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable removals, determined in accordance with § 25.159, and importations (including beer brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the gross tax liability.
(2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for
the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.
(3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate return, Form 5000.24, for each brewery from which beer is removed upon determination of tax.
(b)
Requirements.
(1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, during the previous calendar year, shall notify, in writing the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by EFT.
(2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, prescribed in §§ 25.164 or 25.175. The request shall take into account any time limit established by the bank.
(3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in beer taxes during the preceding calendar year, combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, the taxpayer may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with the return as prescribed by § 25.164. Upon filing the first return on which the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to Form 5000.24, stating that no taxes are due by EFT because the tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that the remittance will be filed with the tax return.
(c)
Remittance.
(1) Each taxpayer shall show on the return, Form 5000.24, information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall file the return with TTB, in accordance with the instructions on Form 5000.24.
(2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.
(3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and will be retained as part of required records.
(d)
Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT.
The taxpayer is subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for filing.
(e)
Procedure.
Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer a TTB Procedure entitled “Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer.” This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will provide the taxpayer with instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to CBP.

deferred payment of tax as provided in § 25.164 or by prepayment return as provided in § 25.175. Payment of reduced rate of tax on beer by return, Form 5000.24, may commence with any tax return filed during a calendar year and will continue until the brewer has taxpaid 60,000 barrels of beer at the lower rate of tax, or taxpaid the number of barrels of beer apportioned under § 25.167(b)(3) for that calendar year.
(b)
By claim for refund of tax.
A brewer, eligible to pay the reduced rate of tax on beer during a calendar year, but who has not paid the reduced rate of tax by return during that year, may file a claim using form TTB F 5620.8, for refund of tax excessively paid on beer during that year. Claims for refund of tax will be filed as provided in § 25.285.

§ 25.167
Notice of brewer to pay reduced rate of tax.
(a)
Requirement to file notice.
Every brewer who desires to pay the reduced rate of tax on beer authorized by 26 U.S.C. 5051(a)(2) by tax return, Form 5000.24, shall prepare a notice containing the information required by paragraph (b) of this section. The brewer shall file this notice with the appropriate TTB officer for the first return period (or prepayment return) during which the brewer pays tax on beer at the reduced rate. The brewer shall file the notice each year in which payment of the reduced rate of tax on beer is made by return.
(b)
Information to be furnished.

(2) A statement that the brewer is not a member of a controlled group of brewers, or if the brewer is a member of a controlled group of brewers, a statement that the controlled group will not or is not likely to produce more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer in the calendar year for which the notice is filed.
(3) If the brewer operates more than one brewery, a statement of the locations of all the breweries and a statement of how the 60,000 barrel limitation for the reduced rate of tax will be apportioned among the breweries. If the brewer is a member of a controlled group of brewers, a statement of the names and locations of all other brewers in the group and a statement of how the 60,000 barrels limitation will be apportioned among the brewers in the group.

§ 25.169
Application for employer identification number.

# Prepayment of Tax
§ 25.173
Brewer in default.
(a) When a remittance in payment of taxes on beer is not paid upon presentment of check or money order tendered, or when the brewer is otherwise in default in payment of tax under § 25.164, beer may not be removed for consumption or sale or taken from the brewery for consumption or sale until the tax has been prepaid as provided in § 25.175.

For purposes of this section, “reasonably expects” means that the brewer was liable for not more than $50,000 in taxes the previous calendar year and that there is no other existing or anticipated circumstance known to the brewer (such as an increase in production capacity) that would cause the brewer's liability to increase beyond that level in the current calendar year.
(2) If a brewer determines that it will be liable for more than $50,000 in taxes with respect to beer imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5051 and 7652 during the current calendar year, the brewer shall file Form 5130.9 monthly beginning with the first month during which the tax liability exceeds $50,000, and shall concurrently file Form 5130.9 for any previous month of that quarter. When filing the first monthly report, a brewer shall state on the form that it will be liable for more than $50,000 in taxes for the current calendar year and will henceforth submit monthly filings. The brewer shall then continue to file Form 5130.9 for each subsequent month of that calendar year.
(3) The appropriate TTB officer may at any time require a brewer who is filing Form 5130.9 or Form 5130.26 quarterly to file such report monthly on Form 5130.9 if there is a jeopardy to the revenue.
(c)
Retention.
The brewer shall retain a copy of Form 5130.9 or Form 5130.26 (or any successor form) as part of the brewery records.

(a)
Place of maintenance.
Records required by this part will be prepared and kept by the brewer at the brewery where the operation or transaction occurs and will be available for inspection by any appropriate TTB officer during business hours.
(b)
Reproduction of original records.
Whenever any record, because of its condition, becomes unsuitable for its intended or continued use, the brewer shall reproduce the record by a process under § 25.301. The reproduced record will be treated and considered for all purposes as though it were the original record, and all provisions of law applicable to the original are applicable to the reproduction.
(c)
Retention of records.
Records required by this part will be preserved for a period of not less than three years from the date thereof or the date of the last entry required to be made thereon, whichever is later. The appropriate TTB officer may require records to be kept for an additional period not exceeding three years in any case where such retention is deemed necessary or advisable for the protection of the revenue.
(d)
Data Processing.
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, record data maintained on data processing equipment may be kept at a location other than the brewery if the original transaction (source) records required by §§ 25.292-25.298 are kept available for inspection at the brewery.
(2) Data which has been accumulated on cards, tapes, discs, or other accepted record media will be retrievable within five business days.

§ 25.301
Photographic copies of records.
(a)
General.
Brewers may record, copy, or reproduce records required by this part. Brewers may use any process which accurately reproduces the original record and which forms a durable medium for reproducing and preserving the original record.
(b)
Copies of records treated as original records.
Whenever records are reproduced under this section, the reproduced records will be preserved in conveniently accessible files, and provisions will be made for examining, viewing and using the reproduced record the same as if it were the original record, and it will be treated and considered for all purposes as through it were the original record. All provisions of law and regulations applicable to the original are applicable to the reproduced record. As used in this section, “original record” means the record required by this part to be maintained or preserved by the brewer, even though it may be an executed duplicate or other copy of the document.

# Subpart Ca—Rum Imported Into the United States From Areas Other Than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands
§ 26.30
Excise taxes.
Distilled spirits excise taxes, less the estimated amounts necessary for payment of refunds and drawbacks, collected on all rum imported into the
United States (including rum from possessions other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands), will be deposited into the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands according to the formula described in § 26.31. The amount deposited into the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall be the lesser of $10.50, or the rate imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(1) (including adjustments to the effective tax rate under 26 U.S.C. 5010), on each proof gallon of rum imported into the United States.

§ 26.31
Formula.
(a) The amount of excise taxes collected on rum that is imported into the United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall be deposited into the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands at the rate prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 7652(f). The distribution of such amount between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall be computed by using permanent base percentages, which represent the excise taxes collected on rum brought into the United States from Puerto Rico and from the Virgin Islands during fiscal year 1983. The base percentages are 87.626889 percent for Puerto Rico and 12.373111 percent for the Virgin Islands. The formula shall be as follows:
(1) Take the total amount of excise taxes collected on all rum brought or imported into the United States from all areas (including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands) during the previous fiscal year (October 1-September 30) and multiply that amount by 0.87626889 to determine the share of the entire U.S. rum market that will be allotted to Puerto Rico and by 0.12373111 to determine the share of the entire U.S. rum market that will be allotted to the Virgin Islands;
(2) Subtract from the share allotted to Puerto Rico under paragraph (a)(1) of this section the excise taxes collected on rum brought into the United States from Puerto Rico during the previous fiscal year, and subtract from the share allotted to the Virgin Islands under paragraph (a)(1) of this section the excise taxes collected on rum imported into the United States from the Virgin Islands during the previous fiscal year, to determine each possession's loss or gain in excise taxes in relation to the previous fiscal year's U.S. rum market. Then divide each result by the total excise taxes collected on rum imported into the United States during the previous fiscal year from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
(b) Notwithstanding the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) above, the Virgin Islands' share of the excise taxes on rum imported into the United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall not exceed 49 percent nor drop below 12.373111 percent. Puerto Rico's share of the excise taxes on rum imported into the United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall not exceed 87.626889 percent nor drop below 51 percent.
(c) The percentage for the distribution of the excise taxes collected on rum imported into the United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, that will be paid over to the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, shall be effective on March 1 of each year, and shall remain in effect until March 1 of the following year.
(d) The method for transferring the excise tax collections on rum imported from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, into the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall be the same as the method used for transferring excise taxes into the Treasury of Puerto Rico on distilled spirits (with an alcohol content of at least 92 percent rum) brought into the United States from Puerto Rico.
(e) The formula prescribed in this section shall take effect on March 1, 1987. Prior to that date, Puerto Rico shall continue to receive 86.4 percent of the eligible excise taxes on rum imported from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The Virgin Islands shall continue to receive 13.6
percent of these eligible excise taxes until March 1, 1987.

# Subpart Cb—Products Coming Into the United States From Puerto Rico
§ 26.35
Taxable status.
(a) Liquors coming into the United States from Puerto Rico, except as provided in § 26.36, are subject to a tax equal to the internal revenue tax imposed on the production in the United States of like liquors. Articles coming into the United States from Puerto Rico, except as provided in § 26.36, are subject to tax on the liquors contained therein at the rates imposed in the United States on like liquors of domestic production.
(b) The excise taxes collected on distilled spirits or articles containing distilled spirits shall be deposited into the Treasury of Puerto Rico only if at least 92 percent of the alcoholic content of such products is rum. The amount deposited into the Treasury of Puerto Rico shall not exceed the lesser of $10.50, or the rate imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(1) (including adjustments to the effective tax rate under 26 U.S.C. 5010), on each proof gallon of such distilled spirits or articles, other than eligible articles, containing distilled spirits coming into the United States or consumed on the island. Such excise tax deposits will be reduced by the estimated amount necessary for payment of refunds and drawbacks.
(c) Except for products described in 26 U.S.C. 7652(c), no excise taxes shall be deposited into the Treasury of Puerto Rico if an excise tax subsidy is provided by Puerto Rico that is of a kind different from, or in an amount per value or volume of production greater than, any subsidy offered by Puerto Rico to industries manufacturing products not subject to Federal excise tax.

§ 26.79a
Computation of effective tax rate.
(a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
(1) the numerator will be the sum of:
(i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product (exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
(ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b) (1), (2), or (3), as applicable; and
(iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled spirits exceed 2
1/2
% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) The denominator will be the sum of:
(i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
(ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided by 100.
(b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is five or over, a unit will be added.
(c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.
1
Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors exceed 2

§ 26.112
Returns for deferred payment of tax.
(a)
Returns.
The taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652(a), (equal to the taxes imposed in the United States by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(1), 5041, or 5051), the payment of which has been deferred under the provisions of §§ 26.80, 26.95 or 26.104 of this part, shall be paid pursuant to a return on TTB Form 5000.25 prepared in accordance with the instructions on the form.
(b)
Return periods
—(1)
Semimonthly return period.
Except in the case of a taxpayer who qualifies for, and chooses to use, annual or quarterly return periods as provided in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, all taxpayers must use semimonthly return periods for deferred payment of tax. The semimonthly return periods run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each month, and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Annual return period.
Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to use an annual return period if the taxpayer was not liable for more than $1,000 in taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652 in the preceding calendar year and if that taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $1,000 in such taxes during the current calendar year. In such a case the last day for paying the tax and filing the return will be the 14th day after the last day of the calendar year. However, the taxpayer may not use the annual return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $1,000, and any tax that has not been paid on
that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the quarterly or semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
(3)
Quarterly return period.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to use a quarterly return period if the taxpayer was not liable for more than $50,000 in taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652 in the preceding calendar year and if that taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in such taxes during the current calendar year. In such a case the last day for paying the tax and filing the return will be the 14th day after the last day of the calendar quarter. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax that has not been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
(4) The following additional rules apply to the annual and quarterly return period procedures under this section:
(i) A “taxpayer” is an individual, corporation, partnership, or other entity that is assigned a single Employer Identification Number as defined in 26 CFR 301.7701-12;
(ii) “Reasonably expects” means that there is no existing or anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's tax liability to exceed the prescribed limit;
(iii) A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the tax liability for all locations with respect to distilled spirits, wine, or beer tax liability to determine eligibility for the return procedures;
(iv) A taxpayer who has both domestic operations and import transactions must combine the tax liability on the domestic operations and the imports with respect to distilled spirits, wine, or beer tax liability to determine eligibility for the return procedures;
(v) The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for purposes of determining eligibility for the return procedures. However, a taxpayer who is eligible for the return procedures, and who is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more in distilled spirits, wine, or beer excise taxes per year, is required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer (EFT). Quarterly payments via EFT must be transmitted in accordance with section 5061(e);
(vi) A new taxpayer is eligible to use the return procedures in the first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $1,000 (in the case of the annual return procedure) or $50,000 (in the case of the quarterly return procedure) in distilled spirits, wine, or beer taxes during that calendar year; and
(vii) If a taxpayer becomes ineligible to use a return procedure described in paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section because the taxpayer's liability exceeds $1,000 or $50,000, respectively, during a taxable year, that taxpayer may resume that return procedure only after a full calendar year has passed during which the taxpayer's liability did not exceed $1,000 or $50,000 as the case may be. A taxpayer may not use an annual or quarterly return procedure during any calendar year in which the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for more than $1,000 (in the case of the annual return procedure) or $50,000 (in the case of the quarterly return procedure) in distilled spirits, wine, or beer taxes.
(c)
Filing.
(1) The original of TTB Form 5000.25, with remittance covering the full amount of the tax, shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer not later than the 14th day after the last day of the return period except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) The tax shall be paid in full by remittance at the time the return is
filed, unless the proprietor is required to make remittances by electronic fund transfer in accordance with § 26.112a.
(3) The remittance may be in any form that is authorized to be accepted under the provisions of § 70.61 of this chapter.
(4) When the return and remittance are delivered by U.S. mail to the office of the appropriate TTB officer, the date of the official postmark of the U.S. Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the return and remittance were mailed shall be treated as the date of delivery.
(d)
Special September rule for taxes due by semimonthly return.
(1)
Division of second semimonthly period.
(i)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the second semimonthly period for the month of September is divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 26th day, and from the 27th day through the 30th day. The taxpayer shall file a return on TTB Form 5000.25, and make remittance, for the period September 16-26, no later than September 29. The taxpayer shall file a return on TTB Form 5000.25, and make remittance, for the period September 27-30, no later than October 14.
(ii)
Taxpayment not by electronic fund transfer.
In the case of taxes for which remittance by electronic fund transfer (EFT) is not required by § 26.112a, the second semimonthly period of September is divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 25th day, and from the 26th day through the 30th day. The taxpayer shall file a return on TTB Form 5000.25, and make remittance, for the period September 16-25, no later than September 28. The taxpayer shall file a return on TTB Form 5000.25, and make remittance, for the period September 26-30, no later than October 14.
(2)
Amount of payment—Safe harbor rule.
(i)
General.
Taxpayers are considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section if the amount paid no later than September 29 is not less than 11/15ths (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
(ii)
Taxpayment not by EFT.
Taxpayers are considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section if the amount paid no later than September 28 is not less than 2/3rds (66.7 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
(3)
Weekends and holidays.
If the required taxpayment due date for the period September 16-25 or September 16-26, as applicable, falls on a Saturday or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding day. If the required due date falls on a Sunday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately following day.
(e)
Default.
Where a taxpayer has defaulted in any payment of tax under this section, during the period of such default and until the appropriate TTB officer finds that the revenue will not be jeopardized by deferred payment of tax under this section, the tax shall be prepaid by such taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of § 26.113. During such period, distilled spirits, wine, or beer shall not be released from the proprietor's premises before the proprietor has paid the tax thereon. In the event of default, the appropriate TTB officer shall immediately notify the Secretary and the revenue agent at the premises that tax is to be prepaid until further notice, and upon a finding that the revenue will not be jeopardized by resumption of deferred payment or tax under this section, the appropriate TTB officer shall notify the Secretary and the
revenue agent that deferred payment may be resumed.

§ 26.112a
Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.
(a)
General.
(1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 19 and 27 of this chapter, a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 24 and 27 of this chapter, or a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 25 and 27 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment by cash, check, or money order, of distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, as described in § 26.112, is not authorized for a taxpayer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is to be summarized separately for distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, and is defined as the gross tax liability on each type of product for which taxes are paid in accordance with this subpart, taxable withdrawals from premises in the United States, and importation during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises at which tax liabilities are incurred by the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the gross tax liability.
(2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.
(3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate tax return, for each premises from which distilled spirits, wine, or beer is withdrawn upon determination of tax.
(b)
Requirements.
(1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 19 and 27 of this chapter, a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 24 and 27 of this chapter, or a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 25 and 27 of this chapter during the previous calendar year, shall notify, in writing, the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by EFT.
(2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made
to the bank early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, prescribed in § 26.112 or § 26.113. The request shall take into account any time limit established by the bank.

Upon filing the first return on which the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to the tax return, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.
(c)
Remittance.
(1) Each taxpayer shall show on the tax return, information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall file the return with the appropriate TTB officer.
(2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.
(3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained as part of required records.
(d)
Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT.
The taxpayer is subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for filing.
(e)
Procedure.
Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer a TTB procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will provide the taxpayer with instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to CBP.

(d) Internal revenue taxes payable on liquors brought into the United States from the Virgin Islands are collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in accordance with CBP requirements. The tax must be paid on the basis of a return, and the customs form (including any electronic transmissions) by which the liquors are duty- and tax-paid to CBP will be treated as a return for purposes of this part.

(e) Distilled spirits, natural wines, and beer in bulk containers may be released from customs custody without payment of tax under the provisions of subpart Oa of this part and thereafter removed subject to tax from, respectively, a distilled spirits plant, bonded wine cellar, or brewery. The tax will be collected and paid under the provisions of parts 19, 24, and 25 of this chapter, respectively.
(f)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, in the case of an entry for warehousing (that is, products transferred directly to a customs bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone), the last day for payment of the tax shall not be later than the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period during which the products are removed from the first such warehouse, even if the products have been removed from that customs bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone for transfer to another customs bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone.
(2) Paragraph (f)(1) of this section does not apply to any distilled spirits, wines, or beer entered for warehousing and then removed for transfer to another customs bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone that is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary to be destined for export.
(g) Regardless of the method of filing, the person bringing the liquors into the United States must retain as a record the information required by this section, any information provided to CBP to meet CBP requirements, and any supporting documentation. These records must be retained in accordance with the record retention requirements of § 26.276, and the records must be made available upon request of the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer.

(b) A credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 U.S.C. 7652 is allowable under 26 U.S.C. 5010 on each proof gallon of alcohol derived from eligible wine or from eligible flavors which do not exceed 2
1/2
percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis. The credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.
(c) Where credit against the tax is desired, the person liable for the tax shall establish an effective tax rate in accordance with § 26.262a. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each withdrawal or other disposition of the distilled spirits within the United States.

§ 26.262a
Computation of effective tax rate.
(a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
(1) The numerator will be the sum of:
(i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product (exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), multipled by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
(ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b) (1), (2), or (3), as applicable; and
(iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled spirits exceed 2
1/2
% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) The denominator will be the sum of:
(i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
(ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided by 100.
(b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is five or over, a unit will be added.
(c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.
1
Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors exceed 2
1/2
% of the total proof gallons in the batch (100.9 − (2
1/2
%) × 3,371.8 = 16.6).

(b) A credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 U.S.C. 5001 is allowable under 26 U.S.C. 5010 on each proof gallon of alcohol derived from eligible wine or from eligible flavors which do not exceed 2
1/2
percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis. The credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.
(c) Where credit against the tax is desired, the person liable for the tax shall establish an effective tax rate in accordance with § 27.41. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each entry.

§ 27.41
Computation of effective tax rate.
(a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:
(1) The numerator will be the sum of:
(i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product (exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
(ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(1), (2), or (3), as applicable; and
(iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled spirits exceed 2
1/2
% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) The denominator will be the sum of:
(i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
(ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided by 100.
(b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is five or over, a unit will be added.
(c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.
1
Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors exceed 2
1/2
% of the total proof gallons in the batch (100.9 − (2
1/2
%) × 3.371.8 = 16.6).

§ 27.48a
Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.
(a) Each importer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in distilled spirits taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 19 and 26 of this chapter, a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in wine taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 24 and 26 of this chapter, or a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in beer taxes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 25 and 26 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT), as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, of such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of such taxes by cash, check, or money order is not authorized for an importer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is to be summarized separately for distilled spirits taxes, wine taxes, or beer taxes, and is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals from premises in the United States and importations (including products of the same tax class brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer.

Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the
controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.
(c) Electronic fund transfer or EFT means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic tape, so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to either debit or credit an account, in accordance with procedures established by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection..

Definitions.
When used in this section, the following terms have the meaning indicated:
Affiliate
means any one of two or more persons if one of such persons has actual or legal control, directly or indirectly, whether by stock ownership or otherwise, of the other or others of such persons, and includes a winery's parent or subsidiary or any other entity in which the winery's parent or subsidiary has a controlling ownership interest. An affiliate also means any one of two or more persons subject to common control, actual or legal, directly or indirectly, whether by stock ownership or otherwise.
Produced
, when used with reference to wine, means removed from the fermenter.
Proper cellar treatment
means a production practice or procedure authorized for natural wine by part 24 of this chapter, or, in the case of natural wine produced and imported subject to an international agreement or treaty, those practices and procedures acceptable to the United States under that agreement or treaty.
(b)
Certification
— (1)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an importer of natural wine must have an original or copy of a certification from the producing country stating that the practices and procedures used to produce the imported wine constitute proper cellar treatment. The importer of bottled wine must be in possession of the certificate at the time of filing the entry with CBP, and the bottler of bulk wine must be in possession of the certificate at the time the wine is withdrawn from the premises where bottled. The importer or bottler, as appropriate, must provide the certificate upon request by the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer. This requirement may be satisfied by providing the original certification, or a photocopy or electronic copy of the certification. The appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer may request, and the importer or bottler must provide, such information for a period of three years from the date that the product covered by the certificate was released from customs custody or removed from the bottler's premises, as applicable. The certification:
(i) Must be from a governmental or government-approved entity having oversight or control over enological practices in the producing country under the laws of that country;
(ii) Must include the results of a laboratory analysis of the wine conducted either by a government laboratory of the producing country or by a laboratory certified by the government of the producing country; and
(iii) Must be in the possession of the importer at the time of release of the wine from customs custody and may cover multiple importations provided that the wine in each case is of the same brand and class or type, was made by the same producer, was subjected to the same cellar treatment, and conforms to the statements made on the certification.
(2)
Alternative certifications and exemptions
—(i) The following are alternatives to the producing country certification and laboratory analysis requirement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
(A) In the case of natural wine produced and imported subject to an international agreement or treaty specifying that the practices and procedures used to produce the wine are acceptable to the United States, no producing country certification and laboratory
analysis is required, unless that international agreement or treaty requires a certification, in which case the importer must have in his or her possession at the time of release of the wine from customs custody an original or copy of that certification.
(B) If an importer of natural wine or its affiliate owns or controls a winery operating under a basic permit issued under part 1 of this chapter, in lieu of a producing country certification and laboratory analysis, the importer may self-certify that the practices and procedures used to produce the wine constitute proper cellar treatment. The self-certification must be either in the format set forth in paragraph (c) of this section with blocks 1 through 4 completed or in an alternative format that sets forth the same information, and it must be in the possession of the importer at the time of release of the wine from customs custody. In the case of self-certification the importer also must have at the time of release from customs custody records to establish that the requirements for self-certification are met.
(ii) The following are exempt from any certification requirement under this section:
(A) Natural wine produced before January 1, 2005. However, in this case, the importer must have in his or her possession at the time of release of the wine from customs custody records to establish that the wine was produced before January 1, 2005.
(B) Importations of natural wine that are of a personal, non-commercial nature. Examples of non-commercial importations include importations by travelers, gift shipments between individuals, and importations by diplomats for embassy or consular use.
(C) Importations of natural wine that constitute commercial samples. Commercial samples include sales samples, samples for trade shows, and samples for laboratory analysis.
(D) Imported natural wine held on board international passenger carriers, such as cruise ships or airliners.
(c)
Form.
The format for certification referred to in paragraph (b) of this section is the following:
ER24AU05.000
(d)
Preparation of Certification.
The following rules apply for the completion of the certification set forth in paragraph (c) of this section:
(1) Block 1 must state the legal name and address (including country) of the producer of the wine.
(2) Block 2 must include a complete description of the wine, including its brand name, year of production, class or type, and country of origin.
(3) The importer must check the applicable box in block 3:
(i) The importer must check box 3a and ensure that blocks 4 and 5 are completed if no alternative certification applies to the wine under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(ii) If paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) applies to the wine, the importer must check box 3b and complete the certification in block 4.
(4) If the certification is submitted subsequent to approval of a label, the importer must complete block 6 by including the TTB identification number from the certificate of label approval, TTB Form 5100.31.

Importation of denatured spirits and fuel alcohol.
Denatured spirits and fuel alcohol are treated as spirits for purposes of this part and are subject to tax pursuant to § 27.40(a). The tax must be paid upon importation, with only two exceptions: Spirits may be withdrawn from customs custody free of tax for the use of the United States under subpart M of this part; and spirits may be withdrawn from customs custody and transferred to a distilled spirits plant, including a bonded alcohol fuel plant, without payment of tax under subpart L of this part. After transfer pursuant to subpart L, denatured spirits or fuel alcohol may be withdrawn free of tax in accordance with part 19 of this chapter if they meet the standards to conform either to a denatured spirits formula specified in part 21 of this chapter (for withdrawal from a regular distilled spirits plant) or a formula specified in § 19.746 of this chapter (for withdrawal from an alcohol fuel plant). Such withdrawal is permitted, even though the denaturation or rendering unfit for beverage use may have occurred, in whole or in part, in a foreign country. For purposes of this chapter, the denaturation or rendering unfit is deemed to have occurred at the distilled spirits plant (including the alcohol fuel plant), the proprietor of which is responsible for compliance with part 21 or § 19.746, as the case may be. Imported fuel alcohol shall also conform to the requirements of 27 CFR 19.742.

§ 27.266
Importer reference number.
An importer who does not have and is not required to obtain an FAA Act basic permit must request and receive a reference number from the appropriate TTB officer before receiving assignments of CBMA tax benefits from foreign producers under § 27.262. The importer must provide this reference number to any foreign producers that will assign CBMA tax benefits to the importer.
§ 27.268
Revocation of eligibility for CBMA tax benefits.
(a)
Revocation of foreign producer's eligibility.
A foreign producer who provides erroneous or fraudulent information that the appropriate TTB officer determines is material to the eligibility of the foreign producer to assign CBMA tax benefits under § 27.262 may have such eligibility revoked, for a period not to exceed three calendar years following the year of revocation, under the procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. If the foreign producer has previously had its eligibility revoked under this section, any subsequent revocation may instead be permanent. In any case where a criminal conviction results from the foreign producer's providing of erroneous or fraudulent information as described above, eligibility will be permanently revoked.
(b)
Notice of contemplated revocation.
Where the appropriate TTB officer has reason to believe that a foreign producer, including anyone acting on behalf of a foreign producer, has provided erroneous or fraudulent information as described in paragraph (a) of this section, such officer will provide a written notice of contemplated revocation to the foreign producer. Such notice will set forth the facts and analysis supporting the contemplated revocation, as well as the period of contemplated
revocation. Written notice will be provided electronically to persons authorized to act on behalf of the foreign producer within the online foreign producer registration and assignment system as provided in § 27.260.
(c)
Response to contemplated revocation.
A foreign producer in receipt of a notice of contemplated revocation, or its representative, may submit a written response to the appropriate TTB officer explaining why the foreign producer believes the information at issue was not erroneous or fraudulent, or why such information is not material to the foreign producer qualifying for CBMA tax benefits. This response must be submitted within 45 days of receipt of the written notice of contemplated revocation and must be submitted electronically through means specified in such notice. Any representative of the foreign producer in these proceedings must be authorized by the foreign producer pursuant to a duly executed power of attorney or other document deemed acceptable to the appropriate TTB officer. If the foreign producer does not submit a response within 45 days, the appropriate TTB officer will issue an order of revocation as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Revocation determination.
Following receipt of a foreign producer's response to a contemplated revocation, the appropriate TTB officer will consider the arguments raised in the response and issue an order either dismissing the contemplated revocation or imposing a revocation as authorized under paragraph (a) of this section. Any order imposing revocation will set forth the facts and analysis supporting the revocation, taking into consideration any response provided by the foreign producer under paragraph (c) of this section. The order will be provided electronically to the foreign producer or the foreign producer's representative in the matter.
(e)
Review
—(1)
Appeal.
A foreign producer may appeal an order of revocation issued under paragraph (d) of this section by submitting a written appeal to the appropriate TTB officer within 45 days of receipt of such order. The appeal must explain why the foreign producer believes its revocation is in error, supported by facts and analysis. The appeal must be submitted electronically through the means specified in the order of revocation. The appropriate TTB officer will issue a final decision by notifying the foreign producer within 90 days of receipt of the appeal whether the appeal is granted or denied, and the reasons for the determination. The appropriate TTB officer may extend this period of time once by an additional 90 days if the appropriate TTB officer requires additional time to consider the issues presented by an appeal and must notify the foreign producer of the extension within the initial 90-day period. If the appropriate TTB officer fails to issue a decision granting or denying the appeal within the applicable deadline, the appeal is denied and such denial will be considered a final decision.
(2)
Judicial review.
A final decision from the appropriate TTB officer following appeal is required prior to application to the Federal courts for review of any order of revocation.
(f)
Notice to affected importers.
In any instance where an order imposing revocation of a foreign producer's eligibility for CBMA tax benefits is issued under paragraph (d) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will notify any importer having an assignment of CBMA tax benefits from that foreign producer of the revocation. In the event that the revocation is appealed and the appeal is granted pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will notify any importer having an assignment from that foreign producer of the dismissal of such revocation.

Liquors may be withdrawn or laden under the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (e) of § 28.21 relating to vessels employed in the fisheries, only for use on vessels of the United States documented to engage in the fisheries and foreign fishing vessels of 5 net tons or over if the district director of customs is satisfied by reason of the quantity requested in the light of (a) whether the vessel is employed in substantially continuous fishing activities, and (b) the vessel's complement, that none of the liquors to be withdrawn or laden are intended to be removed from the vessel in, or otherwise returned to, the United States. Such withdrawal or lading shall be conditioned upon compliance with the applicable provisions of this part. Lading of such liquors for use on such vessels shall be subject to approval by the district director of customs of a special written application by the withdrawer or the vessel's master on customs Form 5125 (in duplicate) and a statement by the withdrawer in his application or notice on the required TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be, that the liquors are to be laden for use as supplies on a vessel employed in the fisheries.

Approval of each such application shall be subject to the condition that the original shall be presented thereafter by the withdrawer or the vessel's master to the district director of customs within 24 hours (excluding Saturday, Sunday, and holidays) after each subsequent arrival of the vessel at a customs port or station and that an accounting shall be made at the time of such presentation of the disposition of the liquors until the district director of customs is satisfied that they have been consumed on board, or landed under customs supervision, and takes up the authorization. The approval of customs Form 5125 shall be subject to the further condition that any such liquors remaining on board while the vessel is in port shall be safeguarded in the manner and to such extent as the director of the port or place of arrival shall deem necessary. When such liquors have been accounted for to the satisfaction of the district director of customs, he shall execute his certificate of lading and use on both copies of the TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be, and forward the original of the form according to its instructions. In the event of a failure on the part of the withdrawer or the master of the vessel to comply with the conditions of this section or upon receipt of evidence that the liquors were not lawfully used as supplies on the vessel, the district director of customs shall advise the appropriate TTB officer of all the facts in the case for determination of any liability incurred. In the case of liquors withdrawn without payment of tax, assessment of tax liability found to have been incurred shall be made against the principal on the bond or, if no bond is required, against the person liable for the tax. In the case of taxpaid or tax determined liquors, the appropriate TTB officer shall determine as to whether to make demand upon the principal and the surety on the bond or to disallow the claim as the case may be.

Reciprocating foreign countries.
The appropriate TTB officer may approve applications relating to the withdrawal or lading of liquors for use on aircraft of those foreign countries which will allow, to aircraft registered in the United States and engaged in foreign trade, privileges substantially reciprocal to the privileges allowed herein to aircraft of a foreign country.

# Subpart A—Scope of Regulations
§ 30.1
Gauging of distilled spirits.
(a)
General.
This part relates to the gauging of distilled spirits. The term “gauging” means the determination of the proof and the quantity of distilled spirits. The procedures prescribed in or authorized under the provisions of this part, except as may be otherwise authorized in this chapter, shall be followed in making any determination of quantity or proof of distilled spirits required by or under the authority of regulations in this chapter. The tables referred to in subpart E of this part appear in the “Gauging Manual Embracing Instructions and Tables for Determining Quantity of Distilled Spirits by Proof and Weight” as incorporated by reference in this part (see paragraph (c) of this section). These tables, together with their instructions, shall be used, wherever applicable, in making the necessary computations from gauge data.
(b)
Tables referred to in subpart E of this part.
Table 1 provides a method of correcting hydrometer indications at temperatures between 0 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit to true proof. If distilled spirits contain dissolved solids, temperature correction of the hydrometer reading by the use of this table would result in apparent proof rather than true proof. Tables 2 and 3 show the gallonage of spirituous liquor according to weight and proof. Table 4 shows the gallons per pound at each one-tenth proof from 1 to 200 proof. Table 5 shows the weight per wine gallon and proof gallon at each proof. Table 6 shows the volumes of alcohol and water and the specific gravity (air and vacuum) of spirituous liquor at each proof. Table 7 provides a means of ascertaining the volume (at 60 degree Fahrenheit) of spirits at various temperatures ranging from 18 degrees through 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
(c)
Incorporation by reference.
The “Gauging Manual Embracing Instructions and Tables for Determining Quantity of Distilled Spirits by Proof and Weight” (Publication 5110.6; November 1978) is incorporated by reference in this part. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register on March 23, 1981.

Appropriate TTB officers.
Appropriate TTB officers shall use only hydrometers and thermometers furnished by the Government. However, where this part requires the use of a specific gravity hydrometer, TTB officers shall use precision grade specific gravity hydrometers conforming to the provisions of § 30.24, furnished by the proprietor. However, the appropriate TTB officer may authorize the use of other instruments approved by the appropriate TTB officer as being equally satisfactory for determination of specific gravity and for gauging. From time to time appropriate TTB officers shall verify the accuracy of hydrometers and thermometers used by proprietors.

§ 30.22
Hydrometers and thermometers.
The hydrometers used are graduated to read the proof of aqueous alcoholic solutions at 60 degrees Fahrenheit; thus, they read, 0 for water, 100 for proof spirits, and 200 for absolute alcohol. Because of temperature-density relationships and the selection of 60 degrees Fahrenheit for reporting proof, the hydrometer readings will be less than the true percent of proof at temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and greater than the true percent of proof at temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Hence, corrections are necessary for hydrometer readings at temperatures other than 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Precision hydrometers shall be used for gauging spirits. Hydrometers and thermometers shall be used and the true percent of proof shall be determined in accordance with § 30.31. Hydrometers are designated by letter according to range of proof and are provided in ranges and subdivisions of stems as follows:

§ 30.23
Use of precision hydrometers and thermometers.
Care should be exercised to obtain accurate hydrometer and thermometer readings. In order to accomplish this result, the following precautions should be observed. Bulk spirits should be thoroughly agitated so that the test samples will be representative of the entire quantity. The hydrometers should be kept clean and free of any oily substance. Immediately before readings are taken, the glass cylinder containing the thermometer should be rinsed several times with the spirits
which are to be gauged so as to bring both the cylinder and the thermometer to the temperature of the spirits (if time permits, it is desirable to bring both the spirits and the instruments to room temperature). If the outer surface of the cylinder becomes wet, it should be wiped dry to avoid the cooling effect of rapid evaporation. During the readings the cylinder should be protected from drafts or other conditions which might affect its temperature or that of the spirits which it contains. The hands should not be placed on the cylinder in such a manner as to warm the liquid contained therein. The hydrometer should be inserted in the liquid and the hydrometer bulb raised and lowered from top to bottom 5 or 6 times to obtain an even temperature distribution over its surface, and, while the hydrometer bulb remains in the liquid, the stem should be dried and the hydrometer allowed to come to rest without wetting more than a few tenths degrees of the exposed stem. Special care should be taken to ascertain the exact point at which the level of the surface liquid intersects the scale of proof in the stem of the hydrometer. The hydrometer and thermometer should be immediately read, as nearly simultaneously as possible. In reading the hydrometer, a sighting should be made slightly below the plane of the surface of the liquid and the line of sight should then be raised slowly, being kept perpendicular to the hydrometer stem, until the appearance of the surface changes from an ellipse to a straight line. The point where this line intersects the hydrometer scale is the correct reading of the hydrometer. When the correct readings of the hydrometer and the thermometer have been determined, the true percent of proof shall be ascertained from Table 1. Another sample of the spirits should then be taken and be tested in the same manner so as to verify the proof originally ascertained. Hydrometer readings should be made to the nearest 0.05 degree and thermometer readings should be made to the nearest 0.1 degree, and instrument correction factors, if any, should be applied. It is necessary to interpolate in Table 1 for fractional hydrometer and thermometer readings.

# Example.
A hydrometer reads 192.85° at 72.10 °F. The correction factors for the hydrometer and the thermometer, respectively are minus0.03° and plus0.05°. The corrected reading, then, is 192.82° at 72.15 °F.
From Table 1:
193.0° at 72.0 °F.
=
190.2°
192.0° at 72.0 °F.

=

192.0° at 73.0 °F.

Difference

0.2°
The hydrometer difference (1.1°) multiplied by the fractional degree of the hydrometer reading (0.82°) = 0.902.
The temperature difference (0.2°) multiplied by the fractional degree of the temperature reading (0.15°) = 0.03°.
Proof at 60 °F. = 189.1 + 0.902 − 0.03 = 189.972° = 190.0°.
As shown, the final proof is rounded to the nearest tenth of a degree of proof. In such cases, if the hundredths decimal is less than five, it will be dropped; if it is five or over, a unit will be added.

Specific gravity hydrometers.
(a) The specific gravity hydrometers furnished by proprietors to appropriate TTB officers shall conform to the standard specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) for such instruments.

§ 30.25
Use of precision specific gravity hydrometers.
The provisions of § 30.23 respecting the care, handling, and use of precision instruments shall be followed with respect to the care, handling, and use of precision grade specific gravity hydrometers. Specific gravity hydrometers shall be read to the nearest subdivision. Because of temperature density relationships and the selection of the standardization temperature of 60 °/60 °F., the specific gravity readings will be greater at temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and less at temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Hence, correction of the specific gravity readings will be made for temperature other than 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Such correction may be ascertained by dividing the specific gravity hydrometer reading by the applicable correction factor in Table 7.

# Example:
The specific gravity hydrometer reading is 1.1525, the thermometer reading is 68 degrees Fahrenheit, and the true proof of the spirits is 115 degrees. The correct specific gravity reading will be ascertained as follows:
(a) From Table 7, the correction factor for 115° proof at 68 °F. is 0.996.
(b) 1.1525 divided by 0.996 = 1.1571, the corrected specific gravity.

# Subpart D—Gauging Procedures
§ 30.31
Determination of proof.
(a)
General.
The proof of spirits shall be determined to the nearest tenth degree which shall be the proof used in determining the proof gallons.
(b)
Solids content not more than 600 milligrams.
Except as otherwise authorized by the appropriate TTB officer, the proof of spirits containing not more than 600 milligrams of solids per 100 milliliters of spirits shall be determined by the use of a hydrometer and thermometer in accordance with the provisions of § 30.23 except that if such spirits contain solids in excess of 400 milligrams but not in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters at gauge proof, there shall be added to the proof so determined the obscuration determined as prescribed in § 30.32.
(c)
Solids content over 600 milligrams.
If such spirits contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters at gauge proof, the proof shall be determined on the basis of true proof determined as follows:
(1) By the use of a hydrometer and a thermometer after the spirits have been distilled in a small laboratory still and restored to the original volume and temperature by the addition of pure water to the distillate; or
(2) By a recognized laboratory method which is equal or superior in accuracy to the distillation method.
(d)
Initial proof.
Except when the proof of spirits is used in making the gauge prescribed in § 19.353 of this chapter or in making a gauge for determination of tax, the initial determination of proof made on the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant for such spirits may be used whenever a subsequent gauge is required to be made at
that same plant provided that no material has been added to change the proof of the spirits.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended, 1362, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204, 5211))

§ 30.32
Determination of proof obscuration.
(a)
General.
Proof obscuration of spirits containing more than 400 but not more than 600 milligrams of solids per 100 milliliters shall be determined by one of the following methods. The evaporation method may be used only for spirits in the range of 80-100 degrees at gauge proof.
(b)
Evaporation method.
Evaporate the water and alcohol from a carefully measured 25 milliliter sample of spirits, dry the residue at 100 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes and then weigh the residue precisely. Multiply the weight of the residue by 4 to determine the weight of solids in 100 milliliters. The resulting weight per 100 milliliters multiplied by 4 will give the obscuration. Experience has shown that 0.1 gram (100 milligrams) of solids per 100 milliliters of spirits in the range of 80-100 degrees proof will obscure the true proof by 0.4 of one degree of proof. For example, if the weight of solids remaining after evaporation of 25 milliliters 0.125 gram, the amount of solids present in 100 milliliters of the spirits is 0.50 gram (4 times 0.125). The obscuration is 4 times 0.50, which is two degrees of proof. This value added to the temperature corrected hydrometer reading will give the true proof.
(c)
Distillation method.
Determine the apparent proof and temperature of the sample of spirits and then distill a carefully measured sample in a small laboratory still, and collect a quantity of the distillate, 1 or 2 milliliters less than the original sample. The distillate is adjusted to the original temperature and restored to the original volume by addition of distilled water. The proof of the restored distillate is then determined by use of a precision hydrometer and thermometer in accordance with the provisions of § 30.23 to the nearest 0.1 degree of proof. The difference between the proof so determined and the apparent proof of the undistilled sample is the obscuration; or
(d)
Pycnometer method.
Determine the specific gravity of the undistilled sample, distill and restore the samples as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and determine the specific gravity of the restored distillate by means of a pycnometer. The specific gravities so obtained will be converted to degrees of proof by interpolation of Table 6 to the nearest 0.1 degree of proof. The difference in proof so obtained is the obscuration.

# Determination of Quantity
§ 30.36
General requirements.
The quantity determination of distilled spirits that are withdrawn from bonded premises in bulk upon tax determination or payment shall be by weight. The quantity of other distilled spirits or denatured spirits may be determined by weight or by volume. When the quantity of distilled spirits or denatured distilled spirits is determined by volume, such determination may be by meter as provided in 27 CFR part 19, or when approved by the appropriate TTB officer, another method or device.

# Determination of Quantity by Weight
§ 30.41
Bulk spirits.
When spirits (including denatured spirits) are to be gauged by weight in bulk quantities, the weight shall be determined by means of weighing tanks, mounted on accurate scales. Before each use, the scales shall be balanced at zero load; thereupon the spirits shall be run into the weighing tank and proofed as prescribed in § 30.31. However, if the spirits are to be reduced in
proof, the spirits shall be so reduced before final determination of the proof. The scales shall then be brought to a balanced condition and the weight of the spirits determined by reading the beam to the nearest graduation mark. From the weight and the proof thus ascertained, the quantity of the spirits in proof gallons shall be determined by reference to Table 4. However, in the case of spirits which contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters, the quantity in proof gallons shall be determined by first ascertaining the wine gallons per pound of the spirits and multiplying the wine gallons per pound by the weight, in pounds, of the spirits being gauged and by the true proof (determined as prescribed in § 30.31) and dividing the result by 100. The wine gallons per pound of spirits containing solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters shall be ascertained by:
(a) Use of a precision hydrometer and thermometer, in accordance with the provisions of § 30.23, to determine the apparent proof of the spirits (if specific gravity at the temperature of the spirits is not more than 1.0) and reference to Table 4 for the wine gallons per pound, or
(b) Use of a specific gravity hydrometer, in accordance with the provisions of § 30.25, to determine the specific gravity of the spirits (if the specific gravity at the temperature of the spirits is more than 1.0) and dividing that specific gravity (corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit) into the factor 0.120074 (the wine gallons per pound for water at 60 degrees Fahrenheit). When withdrawing a portion of the contents of a weighing tank, the difference between the quantity (ascertained by proofing and weighing) in the tank immediately before the removal of the spirits and the quantity (ascertained by proofing and weighing) in the tank immediately after the removal of the spirits shall be the quantity considered to be withdrawn.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))
§ 30.42
Denatured spirits.
The quantity, in gallons, of any lot or package of specially denatured spirits may be determined by weighing it and then dividing its weight by the weight per gallon of the formula concerned, as given in the appropriate tables in subpart H of 27 CFR part 21. In the case of completely denatured spirits, the gallonage of any lot or package may be ascertained by determining its weight and apparent proof (hydrometer indication, corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and then multiplying the weight of the wine gallons per pound factor shown in Table 4 for the (apparent) proof.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))
§ 30.43
Packaged spirits.
When the quantity of spirits (including denatured spirits when gauged by weight) in packages, such as barrels, drums, and similar portable containers, is to be determined by gauge of the individual packages, such quantity shall, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, be determined by weighing each package on an accurate weighing beam or platform scale having a beam or dial showing weight in pounds and half pounds, where packages having a capacity in excess of 10 wine gallons are to be gauged, or in pounds and ounces, or pounds and hundredths of a pound, where packages designed to hold 10 wine gallons or less are to be gauged. In either case the tare must be determined and subtracted from the gross weight to obtain the net weight. From the proof and weight ascertained, the quantity of the spirits in proof gallons shall be determined by reference to Table 2, 3, or 4. However, if the spirits contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters, the proof gallons shall be determined as prescribed for such spirits in § 30.41. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of § 30.44, (a) gross weights and tares of packages being filled need not be taken in any case where the gauge of the spirits is not derived from such weights under the gauging procedure being utilized, and (b) meters, other devices, or other methods may be used for determining the quantity of spirits in individual packages, when such meter is used as provided in 27 CFR part 19, or, when such other device or
method has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer.

Weighing containers of 10 wine gallons or less.
The weight for containers of a capacity of 10 wine gallons or less shall be determined in pounds and ounces, or pounds and hundredths of a pound, and shall be recorded in pounds and hundredths of a pound. The equivalent pounds and hundredths of pounds and the corresponding wine gallons and proof gallons shall be expressed as shown in the following table for the respective weights in pounds and ounces and proofs shown therein or, as applicable, computed in accordance with rules in this section.

Containers of other proofs or sizes.
Where containers of proofs or sizes not shown above are to be filled, the following rule may be used for ascertaining the weight of the spirits to be placed in the container: Divide the number of gallons representing the quantity of spirits to be placed in the container by the fractional part of a gallon equivalent to 1 pound, to obtain the weight of the spirits in pounds and fractions of a pound to two decimal places. Reduce the decimal fraction of a pound to ounces by multiplying by 16, calling any fraction of an ounce a whole ounce. The pounds and ounces thus obtained will determine the point to which the spirits must be weighed to produce the results desired. If the weight must be marked on the container in pounds and decimal fractions of a pound, it will be necessary to convert the ounces to hundredths of a pound. The fraction of a gallon equivalent to 1 pound at any given proof shall be ascertained by reference to Table 4. However, if the spirits contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters, the fraction of a gallon equivalent to 1 pound shall be determined as prescribed for such spirits in § 30.41.

# Example.
It is desired to fill a 1-gallon can with precisely 1 wine gallon of 194 proof spirits:
1.00 divided by 0.14866 = 6.73 pounds.
0.73 multiplied by 16 = 11.68 ounces, rounded to 12 ounces.
Weight of spirits—6 pounds, 12 ounces.
Weight, if required, to be marked on can-6.75 pounds.

§ 30.45
Withdrawal gauge for packages.
When wooden packages are to be individually gauged for withdrawal, actual tare of the packages shall be determined. The actual tare of a package shall be determined by weighing it after its contents (including rinse water, if any) have been temporarily removed to a separate container or vessel. Where the contents of packages have been temporarily removed for determination of tare, the proof, if any rinse water is added to the spirits, shall be determined after a thorough mixing of the rinse water and the spirits and before return of the spirits to the rinsed packages, and the gross weight shall be determined after the spirits and any added rinse water have been returned to the packages. In the case of metal packages the tare established at the time of filling may be used unless it appears to be incorrect.
From the proofs and the net weights of the packages, the wine gallons (if desired) and the proof gallons of spirits shall be determined by the use of Table 2. However, if the spirits contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters, the wine gallon and proof gallon contents shall be determined as prescribed for such spirits in § 30.41. If either the weight or the proof is beyond the limitations of table 2, either table 3 or table 4 may be used.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))

# Determination of Quantity by Volume
§ 30.51
Procedures for measurement of bulk spirits.
Where the quantity of spirits (including denatured spirits) in bulk is to be determined by volume as authorized by this chapter, the measurement shall be made in tanks, by meters as provided in 27 CFR part 19, or by other devices or methods authorized by the appropriate TTB officer, or as otherwise provided in this chapter, or such measurement may be made in tank cars or tank trucks if calibration charts for such conveyances are provided and such charts have been accurately prepared, and certified as accurate, by engineers or other persons qualified to calibrate such conveyances. Volumetric measurements in tanks shall be made only in accurately calibrated tanks equipped with suitable measuring devices, whereby the actual contents can be correctly ascertained. If the temperature of spirits (including denatured spirits) is other than the standard of 60 degrees Fahrenheit, gallonage determined by volumetric measurements shall be corrected to the standard temperature by means of table 7. In the case of denatured spirits, the temperature-correction factor for the proof of the spirits used in denaturation will give sufficiently accurate results, except that the temperature-correction factor used for specially denatured spirits, Formula No. 18, should be that given in table 7 for 100 proof spirits. When the quantity of spirits, in wine gallons, has been determined by volumetric measurement, the number of proof gallons shall be obtained by multiplying the wine gallons by the proof of the spirits as determined under § 30.31.

# Example.
Gauge glass reading inches—88.
Wine gallons per inch—48.96.
Temperature °F—72.
Proof of spirits—86.8.
Temperature correction factor (Table 7)—0.995.
48.96 W.G. × 88 = 4308.48 wine gallons.
4308.48 W.G. × 0.995 = 4286.94 wine gallons.
4286.94 W.G. × 0.868 = 3721.06392 = 3721.1 proof gallons.

§ 30.52
Procedure for measurement of cased spirits.
Where the quantity of spirits in a case is to be determined by volume, such determination shall be made by ascertaining the contents of one bottle in the case and multiplying that figure by the number of bottles in the case. For cases containing bottles filled according to the metric system of measure, the quantity determined shall be converted to wine gallons, as provided in § 19.582 of this chapter. The wine gallons of spirits thus determined for one case may then be multiplied by the number of cases containing spirits at the same proof when determining the quantity of spirits for more than one case. The proof gallons of spirits in cases shall be determined by multiplying the wine gallons by the proof (divided by 100).

# Subpart E—Prescribed Tables

# Note.
The tables referred to in this subpart appear in their entirety in the “Gauging Manual Embracing Instructions and Tables for Determining Quantity of Distilled Spirits by Proof and Weight” which is incorporated by reference in this part (see § 30.1).
§ 30.61
Table 1, showing the true percent of proof spirit for any indication of the hydrometer at temperatures between zero and 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
This table shows the true percent of proof of distilled spirits for indications of the hydrometer likely to occur in practice at temperatures between zero and 100 degrees Fahrenheit and shall be used in determining the proof of spirits. The left-hand column contains the reading of the hydrometer and on the same horizontal line, in the body of the table, in the “Temperature” column corresponding to the reading of the thermometer is the corrected reading or “true percent of proof.” The table is computed for tenths of a percent.

# Example.
Temperature, °F
75
Hydrometer reading
193
True percent of proof
189.5
Where fractional readings are ascertained, the proper interpolations will be made (see § 30.23). If the distilled spirits contain dissolved solids, temperature-correction of the hydrometer reading by the use of this table would result in apparent proof rather than true proof.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))
§ 30.62
Table 2, showing wine gallons and proof gallons by weight.
The wine and proof gallon content by weight and proof of packages of distilled spirits usually found in actual practice will be ascertained from this table. The left-hand column contains the weights. The true percent of proof is shown on the heading of each page in a range from 90 degrees to 200 degrees. Under the true percent of proof and on the same horizontal line with the weight will be found the wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and the proof gallons respectively. Where either the weight or the proof of a quantity of spirits is beyond the limitations of this table, the number of proof gallons may be ascertained by reference to Table 3. This table may also be used to ascertain the wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and proof gallons of spirituous liquor containing dissolved solids where the weight, apparent proof (hydrometer indication corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit), and obscuration factor have been determined.

# Example.
334 lbs. of distilled spirits.
Apparent proof—96.0°.
Obscuration—0.8°.
True Proof 96.0° + 0.8° = 96.8°.
334 lbs. at 96.0° apparent proof = 42.8 wine gallons.
42.8 wine gallons × 96.8° = 41.4 proof gallons.
In addition this table may be used to obtain the wine gallons, at the prevailing temperature, of most liquids within the range of the table, from the weight of the liquid and the uncorrected reading of the hydrometer stem. An application of this would be in determining the capacity of a package.

# Example.
It is desired to determine, or to check the rated capacity of a package having a net weight of 395 pounds when completely filled with spirits having an uncorrected hydrometer reading of 113.0°. The full capacity of the package, 51.5 wine gallons, would be found by referring to the table at 395 pounds and 113° proof (hydrometer reading).
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended, 1362, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204, 5211))
§ 30.63
Table 3, for determining the number of proof gallons from the weight and proof of spirituous liquor.
When the weight or proof of a quantity of distilled spirits is not found in Table 2, the proof gallons may be ascertained from Table 3. The wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) may be ascertained by dividing the proof gallons by the proof.

# Example.
A tank car of spirits of 190 degrees of proof weighed 60,378 pounds net. We find—
Proof gallons
60,000 pounds equal to
16,778.4
300 pounds equal to
83.9
70 pounds equal to
19.6
8 pounds equal to
2.2
Total
16,884.1
That is, the total weight of 60,378 pounds of spirits at 190 proof is equal to 16,884.1 proof gallons. The equivalent gallonage for 70 pounds is found from the column 700 pounds by moving the decimal point one place to the left; that for 8 pounds from the column 800 pounds by moving the decimal point two places to the left.

# Example.
A package of spirits at 86 proof weighed 321
1/2
pounds net. We find—
Proof gallons
300 pounds equal to
32.7
20 pounds equal to
2.2
1 pound equal to
.1
1/2
pound equal to
.1
Total
35.1
That is, 321
1/2
pounds of spirits at 86 proof is equal to 35.1 proof gallons. The equivalent gallonage for 20 pounds is found from the column 200 pounds by moving the decimal point one place to the left; that for 1 pound from the column 100 pounds by moving the decimal point two places to the left; that for the
1/2
pound from the column 500 pounds by moving the decimal point three places to the left.
Fractional gallons beyond the first decimal ascertained through use of this table will be dropped if less than 0.05 or will be added as 0.1 if 0.05 or more. The wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) may be determined by dividing the proof gallons by the proof. For example: 35.1 divided by 0.86 equals 40.8 wine gallons.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C.5204))
§ 30.64
Table 4, showing the fractional part of a gallon per pound at each percent and each tenth percent of proof of spirituous liquor.
This table provides a method for use in ascertaining the wine gallon (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and/or proof gallon contents of containers of spirits by multiplying the net weight of the spirits by the fractional part of a gallon per pound shown in the table for spirits of the same proof. Fractional gallons beyond the first decimal will be dropped if less than 0.05 or will be added as 0.1 if 0.05 or more.

# Example.
It is desired to ascertain the wine gallons and proof gallons of a tank of 190 proof spirits weighing 81,000 pounds.
81,000 × 0.14718 = 11,921.58 = 11,921.6 wine gallons.
81,000 × 0.27964 = 22,650.84 = 22,650.8 proof gallons.
This table may also be used for ascertaining the quantity of water required to reduce to a given proof. To do this, divide the proof gallons of spirits to be reduced by the fractional part of a proof gallon per pound of spirits at the proof to which the spirits are to be reduced, and subtract from the quotient the net weight of the spirits before reduction. The remainder will be the pounds of water needed to reduce the spirits to the desired proof.

# Example.
It is desired to ascertain the quantity of water needed to reduce 1,000 pounds of 200 proof spirits, 302.58 proof gallons, to 190 proof:
302.58 divided by 0.27964 equals 1,082.03 pounds, weight of spirits after reduction.
1.082.03 minus 1,000 equals 82.03 pounds, weight of water required to reduce to desired proof.
The slight variation between this table and Tables 2, 3, and 5 on some calculations is due to the dropping or adding of fractions beyond the first decimal in those tables. This table may also be used to determine the wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) of distilled spirits containing dissolved solids from the total weight of the liquid and its apparent proof (hydrometer indication, corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit). The proof gallons may then be found by multiplying the wine gallons by the true proof.

# Example.
5,350 pounds of blended whisky containing added solids
Temperature °F
75.0°
Hydrometer reading
92.0°
Apparent proof
85.5°
Obscuration
0.5°
True proof
86.0°
5,350.0 lbs. × 0.12676 (W.G. per pound factor for apparent proof of 85.5°) = 678.2 wine gallons
678.2 W.G. × 0.86 = 583.3 proof gallons
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended 1362, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204, 5211))
§ 30.65
Table 5, showing the weight per wine gallon (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and proof gallon at each percent of proof of spirituous liquor.
This table may be used to ascertain the weight of any given number of wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) or proof gallons of spirits by multiplying the pounds per gallon by the given number of gallons of the spirits. The table should be especially useful where it is desired to weigh a precise quantity of spirits.

# Example.
It is desired to ascertain the weight of 100 wine gallons of 190 proof spirits:
6.79434 × 100 equals 679.43 pounds, net weight of 100 wine gallons of 190 proofs spirits.

# Example.
It is desired to ascertain the weight of 100 proof gallons of 190 proof spirits.
3.57597 × 100 equals 357.60 pounds, net weight of 100 proof gallons of 190 proof spirits.
The slight variation between this table and Tables 2 and 3 on some calculations is due to dropping or adding of fractions beyond the first decimal on those tables. This table also shows the weight per wine gallon (at the prevailing temperature) corresponding to each uncorrected reading of a proof hydrometer.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))
§ 30.66
Table 6, showing respective volumes of alcohol and water and the specific gravity in both air and vacuum of spirituous liquor.
This table provides an alternate method for use in ascertaining the quantity of water needed to reduce the strength of distilled spirits by a definite amount. To do this, divide the alcohol in the given strength by the alcohol in the required strength, multiply the quotient by the water in the required strength, and subtract the water in the given strength from the product. The remainder is the number of gallons of water to be added to 100 gallons of spirits of the given strength to produce a spirit of a required strength.

# Example.
It is desired to reduce spirits of 191 proof to 188 proof. We find that 191 proof spirits contains 95.5 parts alcohol and 5.59 parts water, and 188 proof spirits contains 94.0 parts alcohol and 7.36 parts water.
95.5 (the strength of 100 wine gallons of spirits at 191 proof) divided by 94.0 (the strength of 100 wine gallons of spirits at 188 proof) equals 1.01.
7.36 (the water in 188 proof) multiplied by 1.01 equals 7.43.
7.43 less 5.59 (the water in 191 proof spirits) equal 1.84 gallons of water to be added to each 100 wine gallons of 191 proof spirits to be reduced.
This rule is applicable for reducing to any proof; but when it is desired to reduce to 100 proof, it is sufficient to point off two decimals in the given proof, multiply by 53.73, and deduct the water in the given strength. Thus, to reduce 112 proof spirits to 100 proof:
1.12 × 53.73-47.75 equals 12.42 gallons of water to be added to each 100 wine gallons of spirits to be reduced.
This table may also be used to obtain the proof gallonage of spirituous liquor according to weight and percent of proof.

# Example.
It is desired to determine the number of gallons in 400 pounds of spirits of 141 percent of proof. Multiply the weight of one gallon of water in air by the specific gravity in air of the spirits—8.32823 by 0.88862—the product (7.40063) divided into 400 gives 54.049 wine gallons, which rounded to the nearest hundredth is 54.05 and multiplied by 1.41 gives 76.2 proof gallons. In rounding off where the decimal is less than five, it will be dropped; if it is five or over a unit will be added.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))
§ 30.67
Table 7, for correction of volume of spirituous liquors to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
This table is prescribed for use in correcting spirits to volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. To do this, multiply the wine gallons of spirits which it is desired to correct to volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit by the factor shown in the table at the percent of proof and temperature of the spirits. The product will be the corrected gallonage at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. This table is also prescribed for use in ascertaining the true capacity of containers where the wine gallon contents at 60 degrees Fahrenheit have been determined by weight in accordance with Tables 2, 3, 4, or 5. This is accomplished by dividing the wine gallons at 60 degrees Fahrenheit by the factor shown in the table at the percent of proof and temperature of the spirits. The quotient will be the true capacity of the container.

# Example.
It is desired to ascertain the volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit of 1,000 wine gallons of 190 proof spirits at 76 degrees Fahrenheit:
1,000 × 0.991 equals 991 wine gallons, the corrected gallonage at 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

# Example.
It is desired to ascertain the capacity of a container of 190 proof spirits at 76 degrees Fahrenheit, shown by Table 2 to contain 55.1 wine gallons at 60 degrees Fahrenheit:
55.1 divided by 0.991 equals 55.6 wine gallons, the true capacity of the container when
filled with spirits of 60 degrees temperature.
It will be noted the table is prepared in multiples of 5 percent of proof and 2 degrees temperature. Where the spirits to be corrected are of an odd temperature, one-half of the difference, if any, between the factors for the next higher and lower temperature, should be added to the factor for the next higher temperature.

# Example.
It is desired to correct spirits of 180 proof at 51 degrees temperature:
1.006 (50°)−1.005 (52°) = 0.001 divided by 2 = 0.0005
0.0005 + 1.005 = 1.0055 correction factor at 51 °F.

# Example.
It is desired to correct spirits of 180 proof at 53 degrees temperature:
1.005 (52°) − 1.003 (54°) = 0.002 divided by 2 = 0.001
0.001 + 1.003 = 1.004 correction factor at 53 °F.
Where the percent of proof is other than a multiple of five, the difference, if any, between the factors for the next higher and lower proofs should be divided by five and multiplied by the degrees of proof beyond the next lower proof, and the fractional product so obtained should be added to the factor for the next lower proof (if the temperature is above 60 degrees Fahrenheit, the fractional product so obtained must be subtracted from the factor for next lower proof), or if it is also necessary to correct the factor because of odd temperature, to the temperature corrected factor for the next lower proof.

# Example.
It is desired to ascertain the correction factor for spirits of 112 proof at 47 degrees temperature:
1.006 (46°) − 1.005 (48°) = 0.001 divided by 2 = 0.0005
0.0005 + 1.005 = 1.0055 corrected factor at 47 °F.
1.007 (115 proof) − 1.006 (110 proof) = 0.001
0.001 divided by 5 = 0.0002 (for each percent of proof) × 2 (for 112 proof) = 0.0001
0.0004 = 1.0055 (corrected factor at 47 °F.) = 1.0059 correction factor to be used for 112 proof at 47 °F

# Example.
It is desired to ascertain the correction factor for spirits of 97 proof at 93 degrees temperature:
0.986 (92°) − 0.985 (94°) = 0.001 divided by 2 = 0.0005
0.0005 + 0.985 = 0.9855 corrected factor at 93 °F.
0.986 (95 proof)−0.985 (100 proof) = 0.001
0.001 divided by 5 = 0.0002 (for each percent of proof) × 2 (for 97 proof) = 0.0004
0.9855 (corrected factor at 93 °F.) = 0.0005 = 0.9851 correction factor to be used for 97 proof at 93 °F.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1358, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5204))

# Subpart F—Optional Gauging Procedures

§ 31.14
Penalties.
(a)
Criminal penalties.
Criminal penalties for failure to comply with the requirements of this part are imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5603 and 5687. A failure to register as required by this part may result in a penalty under 26 U.S.C. 5603(b).

A failure to submit a registration includes a failure to include the identifying number on the registration.
(c)
Reasonable cause.
The administrative penalty described in paragraph (b) of this section is not imposed when it is shown that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. A dealer who believes that the circumstances that led to the failure were reasonable and who desires to have the penalty waived shall submit a written statement, under the penalty of perjury, affirmatively showing all of the circumstances alleged as reasonable causes for the failure. If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the failure was due to a reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the penalty will not be assessed. If the dealer exercised ordinary business care and prudence but was nevertheless unable to comply with the requirement, then the
failure was due to reasonable cause. Mere ignorance of the law will not be considered a reasonable cause.

The proprietor of a hotel who conducts the sale of liquors throughout the hotel premises is only required to register under this part for one place. For example, different areas operated by the proprietor in the hotel, such as banquet rooms, meeting rooms, and guest rooms, collectively constitute a single place of business. When a concessionaire conducts the sale of liquors
at two or more areas in a hotel, those areas are regarded as a single place of business, and the concessionaire is required to register only once.

However, the appropriate TTB officer may, upon request, authorize the maintenance of records at another business premises also under the control of the same retail dealer when it is determined that such maintenance will not cause undue inconvenience to TTB officers desiring to examine those records. Records of receipts shall consist of all purchase invoices or bills covering distilled spirits, wines, and beer received, or, at the option of the retail dealer, a book record containing all of the required information.
(b)
Records of sales of 20 wine gallons (75.7 liters) or more.
Every retail dealer who makes sales of distilled spirits, of wines, or of beer in quantities of 20 wine gallons (75.7 liters) or more to the same person at the same time must prepare and keep a record of each sale. The record must show the date of sale, the name and address of the purchaser, the kind and quantity of each kind of liquors sold, and the serial numbers of all full cases of distilled spirits included in the sale. Each entry on that record must be supported by a corresponding delivery receipt (which may be executed on a copy of the sales slip) signed by the purchaser or the purchaser's agent.
