Conditions of use
—(1)
Beef cattle and nonlactating dairy cattle
—(i)
Amount.
It is used at the rate of one-half fluid ounce per 100 pounds of body weight applied topically on the backline of the animal. Only one application per season should be made for grub control and this will also provide initial control of lice. A second application for lice control may be made if animals become reinfested, but no sooner than 35 days after the first treatment. Proper timing of treatment is important for grub control; cattle should be treated as soon as possible after heel-fly activity ceases.
(ii)
Indications for use.
For the control of grubs and lice in beef and nonlactating cattle.
(iii)
Limitations.
Do not use on animals simultaneously or within a few days before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting drugs, pesticides, or chemicals. Cattle should not be slaughtered within 35 days following a single treatment. If a second application is made for lice control, cattle should not be slaughtered within 45 days of the second treatment. The drug must not be used within 28 days of freshening of dairy cattle. If freshening should occur within 28 days after treatment, do not use milk as human food for the balance of the 28-day interval. Do not treat lactating dairy cattle; calves less than 3 months old; or sick, convalescent, or stressed livestock. Do not treat cattle for 10 days before or after shipping, weaning, or dehorning or after exposure to contagious infectious diseases.
(2)
Beef cattle and dairy cattle not of breeding age
—(i)
Amount.
It is administered as a single, topical application placed on the backline of animals as follows: For animals weighing 150 to 300 pounds, apply 4 milliliters (mL); for animals weighing 301 to 600 pounds, apply 8 mL; for animals weighing 601 to 900 pounds, apply 12 mL; for animals weighing 901 to 1,200 pounds, apply 16 mL; and for animal weighing over 1,200 pounds, apply 20 mL. For most effective results, cattle should be treated as soon as possible after heel-fly activity ceases. A second application is required for animals heavily infested with lice or for those which become reinfested. A second application should be made no sooner than 35 days after the first treatment.
(ii)
Indications for use.
For control of cattle grubs and as an aid in controlling lice on beef cattle and on dairy cattle not of breeding age.
(iii)
Limitations.
Do not use on animals simultaneously or within a few days before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting drugs, pesticides, or chemicals. Host-parasite reactions such as bloat, salivation, staggering and paralysis may
sometimes occur when cattle are treated while the common cattle grub (
Hypoderma lineatum
) is in the gullet, or while the northern cattle grub (
H. bovis
) is in the area of the spinal cord. Cattle should be treated before these stages of grub development. Consult your veterinarian, extension livestock specialist, or extension entomologist regarding the timing of treatment. If it is impossible to determine the area from which the cattle came and/or exact stage of the grubs, it is recommended that the cattle receive only a maintenance ration of low-energy feed during the treatment period. This lessens the likelihood of severe bloat which may occur in cattle on full feed when the common grub is killed while in the gullet. Do not treat dairy cattle of breeding age; calves less than 3 months old; sick, convalescent, or severely stressed livestock. Do not treat cattle for 10 days before or after shipping, weaning, dehorning, or after exposure to contagious or infectious diseases. Do not slaughter within 45 days of treatment.

(i)
Dip vat procedure.
(A) Prior to charging vat, empty old contents and thoroughly clean the vat. Dip vats should be calibrated to maintain an accurate dilution. Add water, then drug to the vat according to the dilution rate indicated in the table. Add super phosphate at a rate of 100 pounds per 1,000 gallons of vat solution. Super phosphate is added to control the pH of the solution and ensure vat stability. Super phosphate is usually available at most fertilizer dealers as 0-45-0 or 0-46-0. Stir the dip thoroughly, preferably with a compressed air device; however, any form of thorough mixing is adequate. Re-stir vat contents prior to each use. During the dipping operation, each time the dip's volume is reduced by
1/8
to
1/4
of its initial volume, replenish with water and add the drug at a
rate of 1 gallon for each 50 or 200 gallons water added—depending on dilution rate 1:60 or 1:240. Also add super phosphate as necessary to maintain pH between 4.5 and 6.5. Stir well and resume dipping. Repeat replenishment process as necessary. For evaportion, add additional water accordingly. For added water due to rainfall, merely replenish dip with the product according to directions. If overflow occurs, either analyze for drug concentration and adjust accordingly or dispose of vat contents and recharge. Check pH after each addition of water or super phosphate to assure proper pH controls.
(B)
Dip maintenance.
(
1
) With use of dip vat tester, dipping may continue as long as the drug concentration is maintained between 0.15 and 0.25 percent, and the dip is not too foul for satisfactory use as indicated by foul odor or excessive darkening (i.e., color changes from beige to very dark brown).
(
2
) Without use of dip vat tester, vat should be emptied, cleaned, and recharged each time one of the following occurs: When the dip has been charged for 120 days; when the dip becomes too foul for satisfactory use, within the 120-day limit; if the number of animals dipped equals twice the number of gallons of the initial dip volume, within the 120-day limit.
(ii)
Spray method.
To prepare the spray, mix drug with water according to table and stir thoroughly. Apply the fresh mixture as a high-pressure spray, taking care to wet the skin, not just the hair. Apply to the point of “runoff,” about 1 gallon of diluted spray per adult animal. Lesser amounts will permit runoff for younger animals.
(iii)
Pour-on method.
Dilute the drug with water according to table by slowly adding water to the product while stirring. Apply 1 ounce of the diluted mixture per 100 pounds of body weight (to a maximum of 8 ounces per head) down the center line of the back.
(2)
Timing of applications for cattle grub control.
For optimum cattle grub control, it is important to treat as soon as possible after the heel fly season, before the grub larvae reach the gullet or spinal canal, as the rapid kill of large numbers of larvae in these tissues may cause toxic side effects, such as bloat, salivation, staggering, and paralysis.
(3)
Treatment regimens.
(i) Control of scabies mites requires two treatments, 10 to 14 days apart.
(ii) Control of Lone Star Ticks and hornflies requires two treatments, 7 days apart.
(4)
Warnings.
The drug is a cholinesterase inhibitor. Do not use this drug on animals simultaneously or within a few days before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting drugs, pesticides, or chemicals. Do not apply within 21 days of slaughter. For use on beef cattle only. Do not treat sick, convalescent, or stressed cattle, or calves less than 3 months old except in Federal or State eradication programs where immediate treatment of all animals in an infested herd is mandatory. Be sure free access to drinking water is available to cattle prior to dipping. Do not dip excessively thirsty animals. Do not dip animals when overheated. Repeat treatment as necessary but not more often than every 7 to 10 days. Treatment for lice, ticks, hornflies, and scabies mites may be made any time of the year except when cattle grub larvae are in the gullet or spinal canal. Treatment for lice, ticks, and scabies mites may be made any time 7 to 10 days following treatment for grubs. Do not treat grubs when the grub larvae are in the gullet or spinal canal. Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. Do not breathe spray mist. Wear rubber gloves, goggles, and protective clothing. In case of skin contact, wash immediately with soap and water; for eyes, flush with water. Wash all contaminated clothing with soap and hot water before re-use.

(2)
Amount.
The drug concentrations required are as follows:
(i) For control of external protozoan parasites on shrimp:
Shrimp
Concentration of formalin (microliters per liter)
Tanks and raceways (up to 4 hours daily)
Earthen ponds (single treatment)
Penaeid Shrimp
50 to 100
1
25
2
1
Treat for up to 4 hours daily. Treatment may be repeated daily until parasite control is achieved. Use the lower concentration when tanks or raceways are heavily loaded with phytoplankton or shrimp, to avoid oxygen depletion due to the biological oxygen demand created by decay of dead phytoplankton. Alternatively, a higher concentration might be used if dissolved oxygen is strictly monitored.
2
Single treatment. Treatment may be repeated in 5 to 10 days if needed.
(ii) For control of external parasites on finfish:
Aquatic species
Administer in tanks and raceways for up to 1 hour (microliter/liter or part per million (µL/L or ppm))
Administer in earthen ponds single treatment (µL/L or ppm)
Salmon and trout:
Above 50 °F
Up to 170
15 to 25

Below 50 °F
Up to 250
15 to 25
1 2
All other finfish
Up to 250
15 to 25
1 2
1
Use the lower concentration when ponds are heavily loaded with phytoplankton or fish to avoid oxygen depletion due to the biological oxygen demand by decay of dead phytoplankton. Alternatively, a higher concentration may be used if dissolved oxygen is strictly monitored.
2
Although the indicated concentrations are considered safe for cold and warm water finfish, a small number of each lot or pond to be treated should always be used to check for any unusual sensitivity to formalin before proceeding.
(iii) For control of fungi of the family Saprolegniaceae on finfish eggs: Eggs of all finfish except Acipenseriformes, 1,000 to 2,000 µL/L (ppm) for 15 minutes; eggs of Acipenseriformes, up to 1,500 µL/L (ppm) for 15 minutes. A preliminary bioassay should be conducted on a small subsample of fish eggs to determine sensitivity before treating an entire group. This is necessary for all species because egg sensitivity can vary with species or strain and the unique conditions at each facility.
(iv) For the control of mortality in freshwater-reared finfish due to saprolegniasis associated with fungi in the family Saprolegniaceae: In tanks and raceways, administer 150 µL/L (ppm) for 60 minutes per day on alternate days for three treatments.
(3)
Limitations.
Fish tanks and raceways may be treated daily until parasite control is achieved. Pond treatment may be repeated in 5 to 10 days if needed. However, pond treatments for
Ichthyophthirius
spp. should be made at 2-day intervals until control is
achieved. Egg tanks may be treated as often as necessary to prevent growth of fungi. Do not use formalin which has been subjected to temperatures below 40 °F, or allowed to freeze. Treatments in tanks and raceways should never exceed 1 hour for fish or 4 hours for penaeid shrimp (even if they show no sign of distress), nor should it exceed 15 minutes for fish eggs. Do not apply formalin to ponds with water warmer than 27 °C (80 °F), when a heavy bloom of phytoplankton is present, or when the concentration of dissolved oxygen is less than 5 milligrams per liter.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 530.1
Scope.
This part applies to the extralabel use in an animal of any approved new animal drug or approved new human drug by or on the lawful order of a licensed veterinarian within the context of a valid veterinary-client-patient relationship.
§ 530.2
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to establish conditions for extralabel use or intended extralabel use in animals by or on the lawful order of licensed veterinarians of Food and Drug Administration approved new animal drugs and approved new human drugs. Such use is limited to treatment modalities when the health of an animal is threatened or suffering or death may result from failure to treat. This section implements the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994 (the AMDUCA) (Pub. L. 103-396).
§ 530.3
Definitions.
(a)
Extralabel use
means actual use or intended use of a drug in an animal in a manner that is not in accordance with the approved labeling. This includes, but is not limited to, use in species not listed in the labeling, use for indications (disease or other conditions) not listed in the labeling, use at dosage levels, frequencies, or routes of administration other than those stated in the labeling, and deviation from the labeled withdrawal time based on these different uses.
(b)
FDA
means the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
(c) The phrase
a reasonable probability that a drug's use may present a risk to the public health
means that FDA has reason to believe that use of a drug may be likely to cause a potential adverse event.
(d) The phrase
use of a drug may present a risk to the public health
means that FDA has information that indicates that use of a drug may cause an adverse event.
(e) The phrase
use of a drug presents a risk to the public health
means that FDA has evidence that demonstrates that the use of a drug has caused or likely will cause an adverse event.
(f) A
residue
means any compound present in edible tissues that results from the use of a drug, and includes the drug, its metabolites, and any other substance formed in or on food because of the drug's use.
(g) A
safe level
is a conservative estimate of a drug residue level in edible animal tissue derived from food safety data or other scientific information. Concentrations of residues in tissue below the safe level will not raise human food safety concerns. A safe level is not a safe concentration or a tolerance and does not indicate that an approval exists for the drug in that species or category of animal from which the food is derived.
(h)
Veterinarian
means a person licensed by a State or Territory to practice veterinary medicine.
(i) A
valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship
is one in which:
(1) A veterinarian has assumed the responsibility for making medical judgments regarding the health of (an) animal(s) and the need for medical treatment, and the client (the owner of the animal or animals or other caretaker) has agreed to follow the instructions of the veterinarian;
(2) There is sufficient knowledge of the animal(s) by the veterinarian to initiate at least a general or preliminary diagnosis of the medical condition of the animal(s); and
(3) The practicing veterinarian is readily available for followup in case of adverse reactions or failure of the regimen of therapy. Such a relationship can exist only when the veterinarian has recently seen and is personally acquainted with the keeping and care of the animal(s) by virtue of examination of the animal(s), and/or by medically appropriate and timely visits to the premises where the animal(s) are kept.
§ 530.4
Advertising and promotion.
Nothing in this part shall be construed as permitting the advertising or promotion of extralabel uses in animals of approved new animal drugs or approved human drugs.
§ 530.5
Veterinary records.
(a) As a condition of extralabel use permitted under this part, to permit FDA to ascertain any extralabel use or intended extralabel use of drugs that the agency has determined may present a risk to the public health, veterinarians shall maintain the following records of extralabel uses. Such records shall be legible, documented in an accurate and timely manner, and be readily accessible to permit prompt retrieval of information. Such records shall be adequate to substantiate the identification of the animals and shall
be maintained either as individual records or, in food animal practices, on a group, herd, flock, or per-client basis. Records shall be adequate to provide the following information:
(1) The established name of the drug and its active ingredient, or if formulated from more than one ingredient, the established name of each ingredient;
(2) The condition treated;
(3) The species of the treated animal(s);
(4) The dosage administered;
(5) The duration of treatment;
(6) The numbers of animals treated; and
(7) The specified withdrawal, withholding, or discard time(s), if applicable, for meat, milk, eggs, or any food which might be derived from any food animals treated.
(b) A veterinarian shall keep all required records for 2 years or as otherwise required by Federal or State law, whichever is greater.
(c) Any person who is in charge, control, or custody of such records shall, upon request of a person designated by FDA, permit such person designated by FDA to, at all reasonable times, have access to, permit copying, and verify such records.

# Subpart B—Rules and Provisions for Extralabel Uses of Drugs in Animals
§ 530.10
Provision permitting extralabel use of animal drugs.
An approved new animal drug or human drug intended to be used for an extralabel purpose in an animal is not unsafe under section 512 of the act and is exempt from the labeling requirements of section 502(f) of the act if such use is:

# Subpart C—Specific Provisions Relating to Extralabel Use of Animal and Human Drugs in Food-Producing Animals
§ 530.20
Conditions for permitted extralabel animal and human drug use in food-producing animals.
(a) The following conditions must be met for a permitted extralabel use in food-producing animals of approved new animal and human drugs:
(1) There is no approved new animal drug that is labeled for such use and that contains the same active ingredient which is in the required dosage form and concentration, except where a veterinarian finds, within the context of a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship, that the approved new animal drug is clinically ineffective for its intended use.
(2) Prior to prescribing or dispensing an approved new animal or human drug for an extralabel use in food animals, the veterinarian must:
(i) Make a careful diagnosis and evaluation of the conditions for which the drug is to be used;
(ii) Establish a substantially extended withdrawal period prior to marketing of milk, meat, eggs, or other edible products supported by appropriate scientific information, if applicable;
(iii) Institute procedures to assure that the identity of the treated animal or animals is carefully maintained; and
(iv) Take appropriate measures to assure that assigned timeframes for withdrawal are met and no illegal drug residues occur in any food-producing animal subjected to extralabel treatment.
(b) The following additional conditions must be met for a permitted extralabel use of in food-producing animals an approved human drug, or of an animal drug approved only for use in animals not intended for human consumption:
(1) Such use must be accomplished in accordance with an appropriate medical rationale; and
(2) If scientific information on the human food safety aspect of the use of the drug in food-producing animals is not available, the veterinarian must take appropriate measures to assure that the animal and its food products will not enter the human food supply.
(c) Extralabel use of an approved human drug in a food-producing animal is not permitted under this part if an animal drug approved for use in food-producing animals can be used in an extralabel manner for the particular use.
§ 530.21
Prohibitions for food-producing animals.
(a) FDA may prohibit the extralabel use of an approved new animal or
human drug or class of drugs in food-producing animals if FDA determines that:
(1) An acceptable analytical method needs to be established and such method has not been established or cannot be established; or
(2) The extralabel use of the drug or class of drugs presents a risk to the public health.
(b) A prohibition may be a general ban on the extralabel use of the drug or class of drugs or may be limited to a specific species, indication, dosage form, route of administration, or combination of factors.
§ 530.22
Safe levels and analytical methods for food-producing animals.
(a) FDA may establish a safe level for extralabel use of an approved human drug or an approved new animal drug when the agency finds that there is a reasonable probability that an extralabel use may present a risk to the public health. FDA may:
(1) Establish a finite safe level based on residue and metabolism information from available sources;
(2) Establish a safe level based on the lowest level that can be measured by a practical analytical method; or
(3) Establish a safe level based on other appropriate scientific, technical, or regulatory criteria.
(b) FDA may require the development of an acceptable analytical method for the quantification of residues above any safe level established under this part. If FDA requires the development of such an acceptable analytical method, the agency will publish notice of that requirement in the
Federal Register.
(c) The extralabel use of an animal drug or human drug that results in residues exceeding a safe level established under this part is an unsafe use of such drug.
(d) If the agency establishes a safe level for a particular species or category of animals and a tolerance or safe concentration is later established through an approval for that particular species or category of animals, for that species or category of animals, the safe level is superseded by the tolerance or safe concentration for that species or category of animals.
§ 530.23
Procedure for setting and announcing safe levels.
(a) FDA may issue an order establishing a safe level for a residue of an extralabel use of an approved human drug or an approved animal drug. The agency will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice of the order. The notice will include:
(1) A statement setting forth the agency's finding that there is a reasonable probability that extralabel use in animals of the human drug or animal drug may present a risk to the public health;
(2) A statement of the basis for that finding; and
(3) A request for public comments.
(b) A current listing of those drugs for which a safe level for extralabel drug use in food-producing animals has been established, the specific safe levels, and the availability, if any, of a specific analytical method or methods for drug residue detection will be codified in § 530.40.
§ 530.24
Procedure for announcing analytical methods for drug residue quantification.
(a) FDA may issue an order announcing a specific analytical method or methods for the quantification of extralabel use drug residues above the safe levels established under § 530.22 for extralabel use of an approved human drug or an approved animal drug. The agency will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice of the order, including the name of the specific analytical method or methods and the drug or drugs for which the method is applicable.
(b) Copies of analytical methods for the quantification of extralabel use drug residues above the safe levels established under § 530.22 will be available upon request from the Communications and Education Branch (HFV-12), Division of Program Communication and Administrative Management, Center for Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855. When an analytical method for the detection of extralabel use drug residues above the safe levels established under § 530.22 is
developed, and that method is acceptable to the agency, FDA will incorporate that method by reference.
§ 530.25
Orders prohibiting extralabel uses for drugs in food-producing animals.
(a) FDA may issue an order prohibiting extralabel use of an approved new animal or human drug in food-producing animals if the agency finds, after providing an opportunity for public comment, that:
(1) An acceptable analytical method required under § 530.22 has not been developed, submitted, and found to be acceptable by FDA or that such method cannot be established; or
(2) The extralabel use in animals presents a risk to the public health.
(b) After making a determination that the analytical method required under § 530.22 has not been developed and submitted, or that such method cannot be established, or that an extralabel use in animals of a particular human drug or animal drug presents a risk to the public health, FDA will publish in the
Federal Register,
with a 90-day delayed effective date, an order of prohibition for an extralabel use of a drug in food-producing animals. Such order shall state that an acceptable analytical method required under § 530.22 has not been developed, submitted, and found to be acceptable by FDA; that such method cannot be established; or that the extralabel use in animals presents a risk to the public health; and shall:
(1) Specify the nature and extent of the order of prohibition and the reasons for the prohibition;
(2) Request public comments; and
(3) Provide a period of not less than 60 days for comments.
(c) The order of prohibition will become effective 90 days after date of publication of the order unless FDA publishes a notice in the
Federal Register
prior to that date, that revokes the order of prohibition, modifies it, or extends the period of public comment.
(d) The agency may publish an order of prohibition with a shorter comment period and/or delayed effective date than specified in paragraph (b) of this section in exceptional circumstances (e.g., where there is immediate risk to the public health), provided that the order of prohibition states that the comment period and/or effective date have been abbreviated because there are exceptional circumstances, and the order of prohibition sets forth the agency's rationale for taking such action.
(e) If FDA publishes a notice in the
Federal Register
modifying an order of prohibition, the agency will specify in the modified order of prohibition the nature and extent of the modified prohibition, the reasons for it, and the agency's response to any comments on the original order of prohibition.
(f) A current listing of drugs prohibited for extralabel use in animals will be codified in § 530.41.
(g) After the submission of appropriate information (i.e., adequate data, an acceptable method, approval of a new animal drug application for the prohibited extralabel use, or information demonstrating that the prohibition was based on incorrect data), FDA may, by publication of an appropriate notice in the
Federal Register,
remove a drug from the list of human and animal drugs prohibited for extralabel use in animals, or may modify a prohibition.
(h) FDA may prohibit extralabel use of a drug in food-producing animals without establishing a safe level.

# Subpart D—Extralabel Use of Human and Animal Drugs in Animals Not Intended for Human Consumption
§ 530.30
Extralabel drug use in nonfood animals.
(a) Because extralabel use of animal and human drugs in nonfood-producing animals does not ordinarily pose a threat to the public health, extralabel use of animal and human drugs is permitted in nonfood-producing animal practice except when the public health is threatened. In addition, the provisions of § 530.20(a)(1) will apply to the use of an approved animal drug.
(b) If FDA determines that an extralabel drug use in animals not intended for human consumption presents a risk to the public health, the agency may publish in the
Federal Register
a notice prohibiting such use
following the procedures in § 530.25. The prohibited extralabel drug use will be codified in § 530.41.

# Subpart E—Safe Levels for Extralabel Use of Drugs in Animals and Drugs Prohibited From Extralabel Use in Animals

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 556.1
Scope.
(a) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires an applicant seeking approval or conditional approval of a new animal drug to submit a proposed tolerance as part of its new animal drug application when such a tolerance is needed to assure that the proposed use of the new animal drug will be safe (see sections 512(b)(1)(H) and 571(a)(2)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). FDA assigns tolerances for animal drugs used in food-producing animals as part of the application approval process. Tolerances for approved and conditionally approved new animal drugs are codified in subpart B of this part.
(b) Compounds that have been found to be carcinogenic are regulated under subpart E of part 500 of this chapter.
§ 556.3
Definitions.
As used in this part:
Acceptable daily intake (ADI)
means the daily intake which, during up to an entire life of a human, appears to be without adverse effects or harm to the health of the consumer. The ADI most often will be set on the basis of the drug's toxicological, microbiological, or pharmacological properties. It is usually expressed in micrograms or milligrams of the chemical per kilogram of body weight per day.
Acute reference dose (ARfD)
means an estimate of the amount of residues expressed on a body weight basis that can be ingested in a period of 24 hours or less without adverse effects or harm to the health of the human consumer.
Edible tissues
means muscle, liver, kidney, fat, skin with fat in natural proportions, whole eggs, whole milk, and honey.
Marker residue
means the residue whose concentration is in a known relationship to the concentration of total residue in an edible tissue.
mg/kg
means milligrams per kilogram.
Not required,
in reference to tolerances in this part, means that at the time of approval:
(1) No withdrawal period was necessary for residues of the drug to deplete to or below the concentrations considered to be safe, or an adequate withdrawal period was inherent in the proposed drug use, and there was a rapid depletion of residues, so there was no concern about residues resulting from misuse or overdosing; or
(2) No withdrawal period was necessary because the drug was poorly absorbed or metabolized rapidly so as to make selection of an analyte impractical or impossible.
ppb
means parts per billion (equivalent to nanograms per gram (ng/g) or µg/kg).
ppm
means parts per million (equivalent to micrograms per gram (µg/g) or mg/kg).
ppt
means parts per trillion (equivalent to picograms per gram (pg/g) or nanograms per kilogram (ng/kg)).
Residue
means any compound present in edible tissues that results from the use of a drug, and includes the drug, its metabolites, and any other substance formed in or on food because of the drug's use.
Target tissue
means the edible tissue selected to monitor for residues in the target animals.
Tolerance
means the maximum concentration of a marker residue, or other residue indicated for monitoring, that can legally remain in a specific edible tissue of a treated animal.
Total residue
means the aggregate of all compounds that results from the use of an animal drug, including the drug, its metabolites, and any other substances formed in or on food because of such drug use.
µg/kg
means microgram per kilogram.
Zero,
in reference to tolerances in this part, means any residues detected in the edible tissue renders it unsafe.
§ 556.5
General considerations.
(a) The tolerances listed in subpart B of this part pertain only to the species and production classes of the animal for which the drug use has been approved or conditionally approved. Approved and conditionally approved conditions of use in parts 516, 520, 522, 524, 526, 529, and 558 of this chapter, including the species and production classes of animals, are referenced in each tolerance section in subpart B of this part.
(b) All tolerances refer to the concentrations of a marker residue, or other residue indicated for monitoring, permitted in uncooked tissues.
(c) After a tolerance is listed, the finding that the concentration of the marker residue in the target tissue from a tested animal is at or below the tolerance indicates that all edible tissues (excluding milk and eggs unless otherwise indicated) from that tested animal are safe for human consumption. If a listed tolerance is not expressly linked to a target tissue, then the tolerance is specific only for the named edible tissue and inferences cannot be made about the safety of the other edible tissues from the tested animal.
(d) FDA requires that a drug sponsor submit a practicable method as part of their new animal drug application. FDA uses the practicable method to determine the quantity of the drug residues that can safely remain in edible tissues (
i.e.,
the tolerance), the withdrawal period, and any other use restrictions necessary to ensure that the proposed use of the drug will be safe.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 558.3
Definitions and general considerations applicable to this part.
(a) Regulations in this part provide for approved uses of drugs and combinations of drugs in animal feeds. Approved combinations of such drugs are specifically identified or incorporated by cross-reference. Unless specifically provided for by the regulations, a combination of two or more drugs is not approved.
(b) The following definitions apply to terms used in this part:
(1) New animal drugs approved for use in animal feed are placed in two categories as follows:
(i) Category I—These drugs require no withdrawal period at the lowest use level in each major species for which they are approved or are approved for use only in minor species.
(ii) Category II—These drugs require a withdrawal period at the lowest use level for at least one major species for which they are approved, or are regulated on a “no-residue” basis or with a zero tolerance because of carcinogenic
concern regardless of whether a withdrawal period is required in any species.
(2) A “Type A medicated article” is intended solely for use in the manufacture of another Type A medicated article or a Type B or Type C medicated feed. It consists of a new animal drug(s), with or without carrier (e.g., calcium carbonate, rice hull, corn, gluten) with or without inactive ingredients. The manufacture of a Type A medicated article requires an application approved under § 514.105 of this chapter or an index listing granted under § 516.151 of this chapter.
(3) A “Type B medicated feed” is intended solely for the manufacture of other medicated feeds (Type B or Type C). It contains a substantial quantity of nutrients including vitamins and/or minerals and/or other nutritional ingredients in an amount not less than 25 percent of the weight. It is manufactured by diluting a Type A medicated article or another Type B medicated feed. The maximum concentration of animal drug(s) in a Type B medicated feed is 200 times the highest continuous use level for Category I drugs and 100 times the highest continuous use level for Category II drugs. The term “highest continuous use level” means the highest dosage at which the drug is approved for continuous use (14 days or more), or, if the drug is not approved for continuous use, it means the highest level used for disease prevention or control. If the drug is approved for multiple species at different use levels, the highest approved level of use would govern under this definition. The manufacture of a Type B medicated feed from a Category II, Type A medicated article requires a medicated feed mill license application approved under § 515.20 of this chapter.
(4) A “Type C medicated feed” is intended as the complete feed for the animal or may be fed “top dressed” (added on top of usual ration) on or offered “free-choice” (e.g., supplement) in conjunction with other animal feed. It contains a substantial quantity of nutrients including vitamins, minerals, and/or other nutritional ingredients. It is manufactured by diluting a Type A medicated article or a Type B medicated feed. A Type C medicated feed may be further diluted to produce another Type C medicated feed. The manufacture of a Type C medicated feed from a Category II, Type A medicated article requires a medicated feed mill license application approved under § 515.20 of this chapter.
(5) A Type B or Type C medicated feed manufactured from a drug component (bulk or “drum-run” (dried crude fermentation product)) requires an application approved under § 514.105 of this chapter or an index listing granted under § 516.151 of this chapter.
(6) A “veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug” is a drug intended for use in or on animal feed which is limited by an approved application filed pursuant to section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a conditionally approved application filed pursuant to section 571 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or an index listing under section 572 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to use under the professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian. Use of animal feed bearing or containing a VFD drug must be authorized by a lawful veterinary feed directive.
(7) A “veterinary feed directive” is a written (nonverbal) statement issued by a licensed veterinarian in the course of the veterinarian's professional practice that orders the use of a VFD drug or combination VFD drug in or on an animal feed. This written statement authorizes the client (the owner of the animal or animals or other caretaker) to obtain and use animal feed bearing or containing a VFD drug or combination VFD drug to treat the client's animals only in accordance with the conditions for use approved, conditionally approved, or indexed by the Food and Drug Administration.
(8) A “medicated feed” means a Type B medicated feed as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section or a Type C medicated feed as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(9) For the purposes of this part, a “distributor” means any person who distributes a medicated feed containing a VFD drug to another person. Such other person may be another distributor or the client-recipient of a VFD.
(10) An “animal production facility” is a location where animals are raised for any purpose, but does not include the specific location where medicated feed is made.
(11) An “acknowledgment letter” is a written (nonverbal) communication provided to a distributor (consignor) from another distributor (consignee). An acknowledgment letter must be provided either in hardcopy or through electronic media and must affirm:
(i) That the distributor will not ship such VFD feed to an animal production facility that does not have a VFD,

Special considerations.
(1) Type C cattle and sheep feeds may be manufactured from lasalocid liquid Type B feeds which have a pH of 4.0 to 8.0 and bear appropriate mixing directions as follows:
(i) For liquid feeds stored in recirculating tank systems: Recirculate immediately prior to use for no less than 10 minutes, moving not less than 1 percent of the tank contents per minute from the bottom of the tank to the top. Recirculate daily as described even when not used.
(ii) For liquid feeds stored in mechanical, air, or other agitation-type tank systems: Agitate immediately prior to use for not less than 10 minutes, creating a turbulence at the bottom of the tank that is visible at the top. Agitate daily as described even when not used.
(2) A physically stable lasalocid liquid feed will not be subject to the requirements for mixing directions prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section provided it has a pH of 4.0 to 8.0 and contains a suspending agent(s) sufficient to maintain a viscosity of not less than 300 centipoises per second for 3 months.
(3) If a manufacturer is unable to meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, the manufacturer may secure approval of a positionally stable liquid feed by:
(i) Either filing a new animal drug application for the product or establishing a master file containing data to support the stability of its product;
(ii) Authorizing the agency to reference and rely upon the data in the master file to support approval of a supplemental new animal drug application to establish physical stability; and
(iii) Requesting the sponsor of an approved new animal drug application to file a supplement to provide for use of its lasalocid Type A article in the manufacture of the liquid feed specified in the appropriate master file. If the data demonstrate the stability of the liquid feed described in the master file, the supplemental new animal drug application will be approved. The approval will provide a basis for the individual liquid feed manufacturer to manufacture under a medicated feed license the liquid mediated feed described in the master file. A manufacturer who seeks to market a physically unstable lasalocid liquid feed with mixing directions different from the standard directions established in paragraph (d)(1) of this section may also follow this procedure.
(4) If adequate information is submitted to show that a particular liquid feed containing lasalocid is stable outside the pH of 4.0 to 8.0, the pH restriction described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section may be waived.
(5) Required label statements:
(i) For liquid Type B feed (cattle and sheep): Mix thoroughly with grain and/or roughage prior to feeding. Feeding undiluted, mixing errors, or inadequate mixing (recirculation or agitation) may result in an excess lasalocid concentration which could be fatal to cattle and sheep. Do not allow horses or other equines access to Type A articles or Type B feeds containing lasalocid as ingestion may be fatal. Safety of lasalocid for use in unapproved species has not been established.
(ii) For Type A articles or Type B feeds (cattle and sheep): Feeding undiluted or mixing errors may result in an excess lasalocid concentration which could be fatal to cattle and sheep. Do not allow horses or other equines access to Type A articles or Type B feeds containing lasalocid as ingestion may be fatal. Safety of lasalocid for use in
unapproved species has not been established.
(iii) For Type A articles, Type B or Type C feeds (cattle): A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in preruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.
(6) Lasalocid Type A medicated articles containing lasalocid dried fermentation residue are for use in cattle and sheep feed only.
(7) Each use in a free-choice Type C cattle feed as in paragraphs (e)(3)(vi) through (e)(3)(viii) of this section must be the subject of an approved NADA or supplemental NADA as provided in § 510.455 of this chapter.

(2)-(3) [Reserved]
(4) Liquid Type B feeds shall bear an expiration date of 8 weeks after its date of manufacture.
(5) All Type A medicated articles containing monensin shall bear the following warning statement: When mixing and handling monensin Type A medicated articles, use protective clothing, impervious gloves, and a dust mask. Operators should wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling. If accidental eye contact occurs, immediately rinse thoroughly with water.
(6) All formulations containing monensin shall bear the following caution statement: Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin. Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal.
(7) Type A medicated articles containing monensin intended for use in cattle and goats shall bear, in addition to the caution statement in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the following statements:
(i) Monensin medicated cattle and goat feeds are safe for use in cattle and goats only. Consumption by unapproved species may result in toxic reactions.
(ii) Feeding undiluted or mixing errors resulting in high concentrations of monensin has been fatal to cattle and could be fatal to goats.
(iii) Must be thoroughly mixed in feeds before use.
(iv) Do not feed undiluted.
(v) Do not exceed the levels of monensin recommended in the feeding directions, as reduced average daily gains may result.
(vi) Do not feed to lactating goats.
(vii) If feed refusals containing monensin are fed to other groups of cattle, the concentration of monensin in the refusals and amount of refusals fed should be taken into consideration to prevent monensin overdosing (see paragraphs (d)(10)(i) and (d)(10)(ii) of this section).
(viii) A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in pre-ruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.
(ix) You may notice the following: Reduced voluntary feed intake in dairy cows fed monensin. This reduction increases with higher doses of monensin fed. Rule out monensin as the cause of reduced feed intake before attributing to other causes such as illness, feed management, or the environment. Reduced milk fat percentage in dairy cows fed monensin. This reduction increases with higher doses of monensin fed. Increased incidence of cystic ovaries and metritis in dairy cows fed monensin. Reduced conception rates, increased services per animal, and extended days open and corresponding calving intervals in dairy cows fed monensin. Have a comprehensive and ongoing nutritional, reproductive, and herd health program in place when feeding monensin to dairy cows.
(x) Inadequate mixing (recirculation or agitation) of monensin liquid Type B or Type C medicated feeds has resulted in increased monensin concentration which has been fatal to cattle and could be fatal to goats.
(8) Type A medicated articles containing monensin intended for use in chickens, turkeys, and quail shall bear the following statements:
(i) Do not allow horses, other equines, mature turkeys, or guinea fowl access to feed containing monensin. Ingestion of monensin by horses and guinea fowl has been fatal.

(ii) [Reserved]
(4) Special considerations for use of tilmicosin medicated swine feeds include the following:
(i) The expiration date of VFDs for tilmicosin must not exceed 90 days from the time of issuance.
(ii) Labeling of tilmicosin Type B or Type C medicated feeds for swine must bear the following warning: “Do not use in any feeds containing bentonite. Bentonite in feeds may affect the efficacy of tilmicosin.”
(iii) Feed containing tilmicosin shall not be fed to pigs for more than 21 days during each phase of production without ceasing administration for reevaluation of antimicrobial use by a licensed veterinarian before reinitiating a further course of therapy with an appropriate antimicrobial.
(5) Special consideration for use of tilmicosin medicated cattle feeds include the following:
(i) The expiration date of VFDs for cattle must not exceed 45 days from the time of issuance.
(ii) Labeling of tilmicosin Type B or Type C medicated feeds for cattle must bear the following warning: “Do not use in any feeds containing bentonite, cottonseed meal, or cottonseed hulls. Bentonite, cottonseed meal, or cottonseed hulls in feeds may affect the efficacy of tilmicosin.”
(iii) To assure both food safety and responsible use in cattle, administration of feed containing tilmicosin to cattle experiencing an outbreak of BRD must be initiated during the first 45 days of the production period, shall not exceed a single 14-consecutive-day treatment, should not occur concurrent with or following administration of an injectable macrolide, and should not occur within 3 days following administration of a nonmacrolide injectable BRD therapy. Tilmicosin medicated feed treatment has not been evaluated in cattle with severe clinical disease. Cattle with severe clinical illness should be evaluated for individual treatment with an alternative non-macrolide therapy.

No additional improvement in feed efficiency has been shown from feeding monensin at levels greater than 30 g/ton (360 mg monensin/head/day). A decrease in dry matter intake may be noticed in some animals receiving lubabegron. Lubabegron has not been approved for use in breeding animals because safety and effectiveness have not been evaluated in these animals. Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing lubabegron and monensin. Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal. Monensin medicated cattle and goat feeds are safe for use in cattle and goats only. Consumption by unapproved species may result in toxic reactions. Feeding undiluted or mixing errors resulting in high concentrations of monensin has been fatal to cattle and could be fatal to goats. Must be thoroughly mixed in feeds before use. Do not exceed the levels of monensin recommended in the feeding directions, as reduced average daily gains may result. If feed refusals containing monensin are fed to other groups of cattle, the concentration of monensin in the refusals and amount of refusals fed should be taken into consideration to prevent monensin overdosing. A withdrawal period has not been established for this product for preruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.

Feed continuously as sole ration to provide 13 to 90 mg lubabegron/head/day, 0.14 to 0.42 mg monensin/lb body weight per day, depending upon severity of coccidiosis challenge, up to 480 mg/head/day, and 60 to 90 mg tylosin/head/day during the last 14 to 91 days on feed. A decrease in dry matter intake may be noticed in some animals receiving lubabegron. Lubabegron has not been approved for use in breeding animals because safety and effectiveness have not been evaluated in these animals. Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing lubabegron and monensin. Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal. Monensin medicated cattle and goat feeds are safe for use in cattle and goats only. Consumption by unapproved species may result in toxic reactions. Feeding undiluted or mixing errors resulting in high concentrations of monensin has been fatal to cattle and could be fatal to goats. Must be thoroughly mixed in feeds before use. Do not exceed the levels of monensin recommended in the feeding directions, as reduced average daily gains may result. If feed refusals containing monensin are fed to other groups of cattle, the concentration of monensin in the refusals and amount of refusals fed should be taken into consideration to prevent monensin overdosing. A withdrawal period has not been established for this product for preruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.

Definitions.
(a)
Secretary
means the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
(b)
Department
means the Department of Health and Human Services.
(c)
Commissioner
means the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
(d) As used in this part, the term
act
means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act approved June 25, 1936 (52 Stat. 1040
et seq.,
as amended; 21 U.S.C. 301-392).
(e)
Food additives
includes all substances not exempted by section 201(s) of the act, the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, either in their becoming a component of food or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food. A material used in the production of containers and packages is subject to the definition if it may reasonably be expected to become a component, or to affect the characteristics, directly or indirectly, of food packed in the container.
Affecting the characteristics of food
does not include such physical effects, as protecting contents of packages, preserving shape, and preventing moisture loss. If there is no migration of a packaging component from the package to the food, it does not become a component of the food and thus is not a food additive. A substance that does not become a component of food, but that is used, for example, in preparing an ingredient of the food to give a different flavor, texture, or other characteristic in the food, may be a food additive.
(f)
Common use in food
means a substantial history of consumption of a substance by a significant number of animals of the species to which the substance is intended to be fed (and, for food-producing animals fed with such substance, also means a substantial history of consumption by humans consuming human foods derived from those food-producing animals), prior to January 1, 1958.
(g) The word
substance
in the definition of the term
food additive
includes a food or feed or a component of a food or feed consisting of one or more ingredients.
(h)
Scientific procedures
include the application of scientific data (including, as appropriate, data from human, animal, analytical, or other scientific studies), information, and methods, whether published or unpublished, as well as the application of scientific principles, appropriate to establish the safety of a substance under the conditions of its intended use.
(i)
Safe
or
safety
means that there is a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the conditions of its intended use.It is impossible in the present state of scientific knowledge to establish with complete certainty the absolute harmlessness of the use of any substance. Safety may be determined by scientific procedures or by general recognition of safety. In determining safety, the following factors shall be considered:
(1) The probable consumption of the substance and of any substance formed in or on food because of its use;
(2) The cumulative effect of the substance in the diet, taking into account any chemically or pharmacologically related substance or substances in such diet;
(3) Safety factors which, in the opinion of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of food and food ingredients, are generally recognized as appropriate.
(j) The term
nonperishable processed food
means any processed food not subject to rapid decay or deterioration that would render it unfit for consumption. Not included are hermetically sealed foods and other processed foods requiring refrigeration.
(k)
General recognition of safety
shall be in accordance with § 570.30.
(l)
Prior sanction
means an explicit approval granted with respect to use of a substance in food prior to September 6, 1958, by the Food Drug and Administration or the United States Department of Agriculture pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act.
(m)
Food
includes human food, substances migrating to food from food-contact articles, pet food, and animal feed.
(n)
Food-producing animal
means an animal used to produce human food.

Opinion letters on food additive status.
(a) Over the years the Food and Drug Administration has given informal written opinions to inquirers as to the safety of articles intended for use as components of, or in contact with, food. Prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 (Pub. L. 85-929, Sept. 6, 1958), these opinions were given pursuant to section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which reads in part: “A food shall be deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health”.
(b) Since enactment of the Food Additives Amendment, the Food and Drug Administration has advised such inquirers that an article:
(1) Is a food additive within the meaning of section 201(s) of the act; or
(2) Is generally recognized as safe (GRAS); or
(3) Has prior sanction or approval under that amendment; or
(4) Is not a food additive under the conditions of intended use.
(c) In the interest of the public health, such articles which have been considered in the past by the Food and Drug Administration to be safe under the provisions of section 402(a)(1), or to be generally recognized as safe for their intended use, or to have prior sanction or approval, or not to be food additives under the conditions of intended use, must be reexamined in the light of current scientific information and current principles for evaluating the safety of food additives if their use is to be continued.
(d) Because of the time span involved, copies of many of the letters in which the Food and Drug Administration has expressed an informal opinion concerning the status of such articles may no longer be in the file of the Food and Drug Administration. In the absence of information concerning the names and uses made of all the articles referred to in such letters, their safety of use cannot be reexamined. For this reason all food additive status opinions of the kind described in paragraph (c) of this section given by the Food and Drug Administration are hereby revoked.
(e) The prior opinions of the kind described in paragraph (c) of this section will be replaced by qualified and current opinions if the recipient of each such letter forwards a copy of each to the Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine, Office of Surveillance and Compliance (HFV-200), 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, along with a copy of his letter of inquiry, on or before July 23, 1970.
(f) This section does not apply to food additive status opinion letters pertaining to articles that were considered by the Food and Drug Administration to be food additives nor to articles included in regulations in this Subchapter E if the articles are used in accordance with the requirements of such regulations.

[42 FR 14091, Mar. 15, 1977]
§ 570.15
Adoption of regulation on initiative of Commissioner.
(a) The Commissioner upon his own initiative may propose the issuance of a regulation prescribing, with respect to any particular use of a food additive, the conditions under which such additive may be safely used. Notice of such proposal shall be published in the
Federal Register
and shall state the reasons for the proposal.
(b) Action upon a proposal made by the Commissioner shall proceed as provided in part 10 of this chapter.
[41 FR 38644, Sept. 10, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 4717, Jan. 25, 1977; 42 FR 15675, Mar. 22, 1977]
§ 570.17
Exemption for investigational use and procedure for obtaining authorization to market edible products from experimental animals.
A food additive or food containing a food additive intended for investigational use by qualified experts shall be exempt from the requirements of section 409 of the act under the following conditions:
(a) If intended for investigational use in vitro or in laboratory research animals, it bears a label which states prominently, in addition to the other information required by the act, the warning:
Caution.
Contains a new food additive for investigational use only in laboratory research animals or for tests in vitro. Not for use in humans.
(b) If intended for use in animals other than laboratory research animals and if the edible products of the animals are to be marketed as food, permission for the marketing of the edible products as food has been requested by the sponsor, and authorization has been granted by the Food and Drug Administration in accordance with § 511.1 of this chapter or by the Department of Agriculture in accordance with 9 CFR 309.17, and it bears a label which states prominently, in addition to the other information required by the act, the warning:
Caution.
Contains a new food additive for use only in investigational animals. Not for use in humans.
Edible products of investigational animals are not to be used for food unless authorization has been granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
(c) If intended for nonclinical laboratory studies in food-producing animals, the study is conducted in compliance with the regulations set forth in part 58 of this chapter.
[41 FR 38644, Sept. 10, 1976, as amended at 43 FR 60023, Dec. 22, 1978]
§ 570.18
Tolerances for related food additives.
(a) Food additives that cause similar or related pharmacological effects will be regarded as a class, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, as having additive toxic effects and will be considered as related food additives.
(b) Tolerances established for such related food additives may limit the amount of a common component that may be present, or may limit the amount of biological activity (such as cholinesterase inhibition) that may be present or may limit the total amount of related food additives that may be present.
(c) Where food additives from two or more chemicals in the same class are present in or on a food, the tolerance for the total of such additives shall be the same as that for the additive having the lowest numerical tolerance in this class, unless there are available methods that permit quantitative determination of the amount of each food additive present or unless it is shown that a higher tolerance is reasonably required for the combined additives to accomplish the physical or technical effect for which such combined additives are intended and that the higher tolerance will be safe.
(d) Where residues from two or more additives in the same class are present in or on a food and there are available methods that permit quantitative determination of each residue, the quantity of combined residues that are within the tolerance may be determined as follows:
(1) Determine the quantity of each residue present.
(2) Divide the quantity of each residue by the tolerance that would apply if it occurred alone, and multiply by 100 to determine the percentage of the permitted amount of residue present.
(3) Add the percentages so obtained for all residues present.
(4) The sum of the percentages shall not exceed 100 percent.
§ 570.19
Pesticide chemicals in processed foods.
When pesticide chemical residues occur in processed foods due to the use of raw agricultural commodities that bore or contained a pesticide chemical in conformity with an exemption granted or a tolerance prescribed under section 408 of the act, the processed food will not be regarded as adulterated so long as good manufacturing practice has been followed in removing any residue from the raw agricultural commodity in the processing (such as by peeling or washing) and so long as the concentration of the residue in the processed food when ready to eat is not greater than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity. But when the concentration of residue in the processed food when ready to eat is higher than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity, the processed food is adulterated unless the higher concentration is permitted by a tolerance obtained under section 409 of the act. For example, if fruit bearing a residue of 7 parts per million of DDT permitted on the raw agricultural commodity is dried and a residue in excess of 7 parts per million of DDT results on the dried fruit, the dehydrated fruit is adulterated unless the higher tolerance for DDT is authorized by the regulations in this part. Food that is itself ready to eat, and which contains a higher residue than allowed for the raw agricultural commodity, may not be legalized by blending or mixing with other foods to reduce the residue in the mixed food below the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity.

# Subpart B—Food Additive Safety
§ 570.20
General principles for evaluating the safety of food additives.
(a) In reaching a decision on any petition filed under section 409 of the act, the Commissioner will give full consideration to the specific biological properties of the compound and the adequacy of the methods employed to demonstrate safety for the proposed use, and the Commissioner will be guided by the principles and procedures for establishing the safety of food additives stated in current publications of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council. A petition will not be denied, however, by reason of the petitioner's having followed procedures other than those outlined in the publications of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council if, from available evidence, the Commissioner finds that the procedures used give results as reliable as, or more reliable than, those reasonably to be expected from the use of the outlined procedures. In reaching a decision, the Commissioner will give due weight to the anticipated levels and patterns of consumption of the additive specified or reasonably inferable. For the purposes of this section, the principles for evaluating safety of additives set forth in the above-mentioned publications will apply to any substance that may properly be classified as a food additive as defined in section 201(s) of the act.
(b) Upon written request describing the proposed use of an additive and the proposed experiments to determine its safety, the Commissioner will advise a person who wishes to establish the safety of a food additive whether he believes the experiments planned will yield data adequate for an evaluation of the safety of the additive.
§ 570.30
Eligibility for classification as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).
(a) General recognition of safety may be based only on the views of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of substances directly or indirectly added to food. The basis of such views may be either (1) scientific procedures or (2) in the case of a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, through experience based on common use in food. General recognition of safety requires common knowledge throughout the scientific community knowledgeable about the safety of substances directly or indirectly added to food that there
is reasonable certainty that the substance is not harmful to either the target animal or to humans consuming human food derived from food-producing animals under the conditions of its intended use (see § 570.3(i)).
(b) General recognition of safety based upon scientific procedures shall require the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of a food additive. General recognition of safety through scientific procedures shall address safety for both the target animal and for humans consuming human food derived from food-producing animals and shall be based upon the application of generally available and accepted scientific data, information, or methods, which ordinarily are published, as well as the application of scientific principles, and may be corroborated by the application of unpublished scientific data, information, or methods.
(c)(1) General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, shall address safety for both the target animal and for humans consuming human food derived from food-producing animals and may be achieved without the quantity or quality of scientific procedures required for approval of a food additive. General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, shall be based solely on food use of the substance in the same animal species prior to January 1, 1958, and shall ordinarily be based upon generally available data and information. An ingredient not in common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, may achieve general recognition of safety only through scientific procedures.
(2) A substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, may be generally recognized as safe through experience based on its common use in food when that use occurred exclusively or primarily outside of the United States if the information about the experience establishes that the substance is safe under the conditions of its intended use within the meaning of section 201(u) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (see also § 570.3(i)) for both the target animal and for humans consuming human food derived from food-producing animals. Common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, that occurred outside of the United States shall be documented by published or other information and shall be corroborated by information from a second, independent source that confirms the history and circumstances of use of the substance. The information used to document and to corroborate the history and circumstances of use of the substance must be generally available; that is, it must be widely available in the country in which the history of use has occurred and readily available to interested qualified experts in the United States. A person who concludes that a use of a substance is GRAS through experience based on its common use in food outside of the United States should notify FDA of that view in accordance with subpart E of this part.
(d) The food ingredients listed as GRAS in part 582 of this chapter or affirmed as GRAS in part 584 of this chapter do not include all substances that are generally recognized as safe for their intended use in food. Because of the large number of substances the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in their becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food, it is impracticable to list all such substances that are GRAS. A food ingredient of natural biological origin that has been widely consumed for its nutrient properties in the United States prior to January 1, 1958, without known detrimental effects, which is subject only to conventional processing as practiced prior to January 1, 1958, and for which no known safety hazard exists, will ordinarily be regarded as GRAS without specific inclusion in part 582 or part 584 of this chapter.
(e) A food ingredient that is not GRAS or subject to a prior sanction requires a food additive regulation promulgated under section 409 of the act before it may be directly or indirectly added to food.
(f) A food ingredient that is listed as GRAS in part 582 of this chapter shall
be regarded as GRAS only if, in addition to all the requirements in the applicable regulation, it also meets all of the following requirements:
(1) It complies with any applicable specifications, or in the absence of such specifications, shall be of a purity suitable for its intended use.
(2) It performs an appropriate function in the food or food-contact article in which it is used.
(3) It is used at a level no higher than necessary to achieve its intended purpose in that food or, if used as a component of a food-contact article, at a level no higher than necessary to achieve its intended purpose in that article.
(g) New information may at any time require reconsideration of the GRAS status of a food ingredient. Any change in status shall be accomplished pursuant to § 570.38.
(h) If a substance is affirmed as GRAS pursuant to § 570.35 and listed in a regulation with no limitation other than good manufacturing practice, it shall be regarded as GRAS if its conditions of use are not significantly different from those reported in the regulation as the basis on which the GRAS status of the substance was affirmed. If the conditions of use are significantly different, such use of the substance may not be GRAS. In such case a manufacturer may not rely on the regulation as authorizing the use but must independently establish that the use is GRAS or must use the substance in accordance with a food additive regulation.
(i) If an ingredient is affirmed as GRAS pursuant to § 570.35 and listed in a regulation with specific limitation(s), it may be used in food only within such limitation(s) (including the category of food(s), the functional use(s) of the ingredient, and the level(s) of use). Any use of such an ingredient not in full compliance with each such established limitation shall require a food additive regulation.
(j) Pursuant to § 570.35, a food ingredient may be affirmed as GRAS and listed in a regulation for a specific use(s) without a general evaluation of use of the ingredient. In addition to the use(s) specified in the regulation, other uses of such an ingredient may also be GRAS. Any affirmation of GRAS status for a specific use(s), without a general evaluation of use of the ingredient, is subject to reconsideration upon such evaluation.
[42 FR 55206, Oct. 14, 1977, as amended at 81 FR 55052, Aug. 17, 2016]
§ 570.35
Affirmation of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status.
(a) The Commissioner, on his own initiative, may affirm that a substance that directly or indirectly becomes a component of food is GRAS under the conditions of its intended use.
(b)(1) If the Commissioner proposes on his own initiative that a substance is entitled to affirmation as GRAS under the conditions of its intended use, he will place all of the data and information on which he relies on public file in the office of the Dockets Management Staff and will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice giving the name of the substance, its proposed uses, and any limitations proposed for purposes other than safety.
(2) The
Federal Register
notice will allow a period of 60 days during which any interested person may review the data and information and/or file comments with the Dockets Management Staff. Copies of all comments received shall be made available for examination in the Dockets Management Staff's office.
(3) The Commissioner will evaluate all comments received. If he concludes that there is convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS under the conditions of its intended use as described in § 570.30, he will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
listing the GRAS conditions of use in this subchapter E.
(4) If, after evaluation of the comments, the Commissioner concludes that there is a lack of convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS under the conditions of its intended use and that it should be considered a food additive subject to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, he shall publish a notice thereof in the
Federal Register
in accordance with § 570.38.
[41 FR 38644, Sept. 10, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 4717, Jan. 25, 1977; 42 FR 15675, Mar. 22, 1977; 42 FR 55207, Oct. 10, 1977; 50 FR 7517, Feb. 22, 1985; 50 FR 16668, Apr. 26, 1985; 54 FR 18281, Apr. 28, 1989; 62 FR 40600, July 29, 1997; 81 FR 55052, Aug. 17, 2016; 88 FR 45066, July 14, 2023]
§ 570.38
Determination of food additive status.
(a) The Commissioner may, in accordance with § 570.35(b)(4), publish a notice in the
Federal Register
determining that a substance is not GRAS under the conditions of its intended use and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
(b)(1) The Commissioner, on his own initiative or on the petition of any interested person, pursuant to part 10 of this chapter, may issue a notice in the
Federal Register
proposing to determine that a substance is not GRAS and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the act. Any petition shall include all relevant data and information of the type described in § 571.130(b) of this chapter. The Commissioner will place all of the data and information on which he relies on public file in the Dockets Management Staff and will include in the
Federal Register
notice the name of the substance, its known uses, and a summary of the basis for the determination.
(2) The
Federal Register
notice will allow a period of 60 days during which any interested person may review the data and information and/or file comments with the Dockets Management Staff. Copies of all comments shall be made available for examination in the Dockets Management Staff.
(3) The Commissioner will evaluate all comments received. If he concludes that there is a lack of convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS or is otherwise exempt from the definition of a food additive in section 201(s) of the act, he will publish a notice thereof in the
Federal Register.
If he concludes that there is convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS, he will publish an order in the
Federal Register
listing the substance in this subchapter E as GRAS.
(c) A
Federal Register
notice determining that a substance is a food additive shall provide for the use of the additive in food or food-contact surfaces as follows:
(1) It may promulgate a food additive regulation governing use of the additive.
(2) It may promulgate an interim food additive regulation governing use of the additive.
(3) It may require discontinuation of the use of the additive.
(4) It may adopt any combination of the above three approaches for different uses or levels of use of the additive.
(d) If the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is aware of any prior sanction for use of the substance, he will concurrently propose a separate regulation covering such use of the ingredient under this subchapter E. If the Commissioner is unaware of any such applicable prior sanction, the proposed regulation will so state and will require any person who intends to assert or rely on such sanction to submit proof of its existence. Any regulation promulgated pursuant to this section constitutes a determination that excluded uses would result in adulteration of the food in violation of section 402 of the act, and the failure of any person to come forward with proof of such an applicable prior sanction in response to the proposal will constitute a waiver of the right to assert or rely on such sanction at any later time. The notice will also constitute a proposal to establish a regulation under this subchapter E., incorporating the same provisions, in the event that such a regulation is determined to be appropriate as a result of submission of proof of such an applicable prior sanction in response to the proposal.
[41 FR 38644, Sept. 10, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 4717, Jan. 25, 1977; 42 FR 15675, Mar. 22, 1977; 42 FR 55207, Oct. 14, 1977; 54 FR 18281, Apr. 28, 1989; 81 FR 55052, Aug. 17, 2016; 88 FR 45066, July 14, 2023]
