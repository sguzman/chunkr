and
“specially designed” for items specified by 4A906.a;
c. Quantum control components and quantum measurement devices, “specially designed” for items specified by 4A906.a;
Note 1:
4A906 applies to circuit model (or gate-based) and one-way (or measurement-based) quantum computers. This entry does not apply to adiabatic (or annealing) quantum computers.
Note 2:
Items specified by 4A906 may not necessarily physically contain any qubits. For example, quantum computers based on photonic schemes do not permanently contain a physical item that can be identified as a qubit. Instead, the photonic qubits are generated while the computer is operating and then later discarded.
Note 3:
Items specified by 4A906.b include semiconductor, superconducting, and photonic qubit chips and chip arrays; surface ion trap arrays; other qubit confinement technologies; and coherent interconnects between such items.
Note 4:
4A906.c applies to items designed for calibrating, initializing, manipulating or measuring the resident qubits of a quantum computer.
Technical Notes:
For the purposes of 4A906:
1. A 'physical qubit' is a two-level quantum system used to represent the elementary unit of quantum logic by means of manipulations and measurements that are not error corrected. 'Physical qubits' are distinguished from logical qubits, in that logical qubits are error-corrected qubits comprised of many 'physical qubits'.
2. 'Fully controlled' means the 'physical qubit' can be calibrated, initialized, gated, and read out, as necessary.
3. 'Connected' means that two-qubit gate operations can be performed between any arbitrary pair of the available 'working' 'physical qubits'. This does not necessarily entail all-to-all connectivity.
4. 'Working' means that the 'physical qubit' performs universal quantum computational work according to the system specifications for qubit operational fidelity.
5. Supporting 34 or more 'fully controlled', 'connected', 'working' 'physical qubits' refers to the capability of a quantum computer to confine, control, measure and process the quantum information embodied in 34 or more 'physical qubits'.
6. 'C-NOT error' is the average physical gate error for the nearest-neighbor two-'physical qubit' Controlled-NOT (C-NOT) gates.

# Technical Note on “Adjusted Peak Performance” (“APP”)
“APP” is an adjusted peak rate at which “digital computers” perform 64-bit or larger floating point additions and multiplications.
Abbreviations used in this Technical Note
n number of processors in the “digital computer”
I processor number (i . . . . n)
t
i
processor cycle time
(t
i
= 1/F
i
)
F
i
processor frequency
R
i
peak floating point calculating rate
W
i
architecture adjustment factor
“APP” is expressed in Weighted TeraFLOPS (WT), in units of 10
12
adjusted floating point operations per second.
Outline of “APP” calculation method
1. For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPO
i
,
performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.
Note
In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero.
2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor
R
i
= FPO
i
/t
i
.
3. Calculate “APP” as
“APP” = W
1
× R
1
+ W
2
× R
2
+ . . . + W
n
× R
n
.
4. For 'vector processors',
W
i
= 0.9.
For non-'vector processors',
W
i
= 0.3.
Note 1:
For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.
Note 2:
For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.
Note 3:
The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.
Note 4:
Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.
Note 5:
“APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.
Note 6:
“APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.
Technical Notes
1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die.
2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c, z.1, or z.3.
Note 7:
A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.

Items:
7A003 does not apply to 'inertial measurement equipment or systems' which are certified for use on “civil aircraft” by civil aviation authorities of one or more Wassenaar Arrangement Participating States, see Supplement No. 1 to part 743 of the EAR.
Technical Notes:
1. For the purposes of 7A003, 'inertial measurement equipment or systems' incorporate accelerometers or gyroscopes to measure changes in velocity and orientation in order to determine or maintain heading or position without requiring an external reference once aligned. 'Inertial measurement equipment or systems' include:
Attitude and Heading Reference Systems (AHRSs);
Gyrocompasses;
Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs);
Inertial Navigation Systems (INSs);
Inertial Reference Systems (IRSs);
Inertial Reference Units (IRUs).
2. For the purposes of 7A003, 'positional aiding references' independently provide position, and include:
a. “Satellite navigation system”;
b.”Data-Based Referenced Navigation” (“DBRN”).
a. Designed for “aircraft”, land vehicles or vessels, providing position without the use of 'positional aiding references', and having any of the following “accuracies” subsequent to normal alignment:
a.1. 0.8 nautical miles per hour (nm/hr) “Circular Error Probable” (“CEP”) rate or less (better);
a.2. 0.5% distanced travelled “CEP” or less (better);
or
a.3. Total drift of 1 nautical mile “CEP” or less (better) in a 24 hr period;
Technical Note:
For the purposes of 7A003.a.1, 7A003.a.2 and 7A003.a.3, the performance parameters typically apply to 'inertia measurement equipment or systems' designed for “aircraft”, vehicles and vessels, respectively. These parameters result from the utilization of specialized non-'positional aiding references' (e.g., altimeter, odometer, velocity log). As a consequence, the specified performance values cannot be readily converted between these parameters. Equipment designed for multiple platforms are evaluated against each applicable entry 7A003.a.1, 7A003.a.2, or 7A003.a.3.
b. Designed for “aircraft”, land vehicles or vessels, with an embedded 'positional aiding reference' and providing position after loss of all 'positional aiding references' for a period of up to 4 minutes, having an “accuracy” of less (better) than 10 meters “CEP”;
Technical Note:
For the purposes of 7A003.b, this entry refers to systems in which 'inertial measurement equipment or systems' and other independent 'positional aiding references' are built into a single unit (i.e., embedded) in order to achieve improved performance.
c. Designed for “aircraft”, land vehicles or vessels, providing heading or True North determination and having any of the following:
c.1. A maximum operating angular rate less (lower) than 500 deg/s and a heading “accuracy” without the use of 'positional aiding references' equal to or less (better) than 0.07 deg sec (Lat) (equivalent to 6 arc minutes rms at 45 degrees latitude);
or
c.2. A maximum operating angular rate equal to or greater (higher) than 500 deg/s and a heading “accuracy” without the use of 'positional aiding references' equal to or less (better) than 0.2 deg sec (Lat) (equivalent to 17 arc minutes rms at 45 degrees latitude);
d. Providing acceleration measurements or angular rate measurements, in more than
one dimension, and having any of the following:
d.1. Performance specified by 7A001 or 7A002 along any axis, without the use of any aiding references;
or
d.2. Being “space-qualified” and providing angular rate measurements having an “angle random walk” along any axis of less (better) than or equal to 0.1 degree per square root hour.
Note:
7A003.d.2 does not apply to 'inertial measurement equipment or systems' that contain “spinning mass gyros” as the only type of gyro.

For the purposes of 7B001: (1) 'Maintenance Level I': The failure of an inertial navigation unit is detected on the “aircraft” by indications from the Control and Display Unit (CDU) or by the status message from the corresponding sub-system. By following the manufacturer's manual, the cause of the failure may be localized at the level of the malfunctioning Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). The operator then removes the LRU and replaces it with a spare. (2) 'Maintenance Level II': The defective LRU is sent to the maintenance workshop (the manufacturer's or that of the operator responsible for level II maintenance). At the maintenance workshop, the malfunctioning LRU is tested by various appropriate means to verify and localize the defective Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA) module responsible for the failure. This SRA is removed and replaced by an operative spare. The defective SRA (or possibly the complete LRU) is then shipped to the manufacturer. 'Maintenance Level II' does not include the disassembly or repair of controlled accelerometers or gyro sensors.

“Development” or “production” “technology” controlled by 9E001 to 9E003 for gas turbine engines remains controlled when used for repair or overhaul. Excluded from 9E001 to 9E003 control are: technical data, drawings or documentation for maintenance activities directly associated with calibration, removal or replacement of damaged or unserviceable line replaceable units, including replacement of whole engines or engine modules.
Note 2:
USML Category XV(f) and ECCNs 9E001, 9E002 and 9E515 do not control the data transmitted to or from a satellite or “spacecraft,” whether real or simulated, when limited to information about the health, operational status, or measurements or function of, or raw sensor output from, the “spacecraft,” “spacecraft” payload(s), or its associated subsystems or components. Such information is not within the scope of information captured within the
definition of “technology” in the EAR for purposes of Category 9 Product Group E. Examples of such information, which are commonly referred to as “housekeeping data,” include (i) system, hardware, component configuration, and operation status information pertaining to temperatures, pressures, power, currents, voltages, and battery charges; (ii) “spacecraft” or payload orientation or position information, such as state vector or ephemeris information; (iii) payload raw mission or science output, such as images, spectra, particle measurements, or field measurements; (iv) command responses; (v) accurate timing information; and (vi) link budget data. The act of processing such telemetry data—i.e., converting raw data into engineering units or readable products—or encrypting it does not, in and of itself, cause the telemetry data to become subject to the ITAR or to ECCN 9E515 for purposes of 9A515, or to ECCNs 9E001 or 9E002 for purposes of 9A004. All classified technical data directly related to items controlled in USML Category XV or ECCNs 9A515, and defense services using the classified technical data remains subject to the ITAR. This note does not affect controls in USML XV(f), ECCN 9D515, or ECCN 9E515 on software source code or commands that control a “spacecraft,” payload, or associated subsystems for purposes of 9A515. This note also does not affect controls in ECCNs 9D001, 9D002, 9E001, or 9E002 on software source code or commands that control a “spacecraft,” payload, or associated subsystems for purposes of 9A004.

Pt. 774, Supp. No. 4

# Supplement No. 4 to Part 774—Commerce Control List Order of Review
(a) As described in EAR § 734.3, the EAR govern only items “subject to the EAR,” e.g., items not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another agency. Thus, for example, if an item is described in the U.S. Munitions List (USML) (22 CFR Part 121) of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130), including one of its catch-all paragraphs, then the item is a “defense article” subject to the ITAR and there is no need to review the CCL with respect to whether it describes the item. See 22 CFR § 120.6 (“Defense article means any item or technical data designated in § 121.1 of the ITAR. The policy described in § 120.3 is applicable to designations of additional items”). If an item is not described on the USML and is otherwise “subject to the EAR,” then work through each of the following steps to determine where the item is covered by the CCL or, if it is not covered by the CCL, and is therefore designated as EAR99.
(1) Step 1. To classify an item “subject to the EAR” against the CCL, review the general characteristics of the item. This will usually guide you to the appropriate category (0 through 9) on the CCL.
(2) Step 2. Once the potentially applicable CCL categories are identified, determine which product group within the CCL category or categories—i.e., A, B, C, D, or E—is applicable to the item.
(3) Step 3. The “600 series” describes military items that were once subject to the ITAR. The 9x515 ECCNs describe “spacecraft,” related items, and some radiation-hardened microelectronic circuits that were once subject to the ITAR under USML Category XV. Just as the ITAR effectively trumps the EAR, items described in a 9x515 ECCN or “600 series” ECCN trump other
ECCNs on the CCL. Thus, the next step in conducting a classification analysis of an item “subject to the EAR” is to determine whether it is described in a 9x515 ECCN or “600 series” ECCN paragraph other than a “catch-all” paragraph such as a “.x” paragraph that controls unspecified “parts” and “components” “specially designed” for items in that ECCN or the corresponding USML paragraph. If so, the item is classified under that 9x515 ECCN or “600 series” ECCN paragraph even if it would also be described in another ECCN.
(4) Step 4. If the item is not described in a 9x515 ECCN or “600 series” ECCN, then determine whether the item is classified under a 9x515 ECCN or “600 series” catch-all paragraph, i.e., one that controls non-specific “parts,” “components,” “accessories,” and “attachments” “specially designed” for items in that ECCN or the corresponding USML paragraph. Such items are generally in the “.x” paragraph of ECCN 9A515 or a “600 series” ECCN.
(i) Step 4.a. Determine whether the item would meet the criteria of either paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of the “specially designed” definition in § 772.1 of the EAR. (These are informally known as the “catch” paragraphs.) If not applicable, then the item is not within the scope of the ECCN paragraph that contains a “specially designed” control parameter. Skip to Step 5.
(ii) Step 4.b. If the item meets the criteria of either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of the “specially designed” definition, then determine whether any of the provisions of paragraph (b) of the “specially designed” definition would apply. (These are informally known as the “release” provisions.) If so, then the item is not within the scope of the ECCN paragraph that contains a “specially designed” control parameter.

The emphasis on the word “control” in Steps 4.a and 4.b is deliberate. Some ECCNs use “specially designed” as a de-control parameter. If an item would
not
be classified under a particular ECCN because it falls within the scope of either subparagraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of the “specially designed” definition, then there is no need to analyze whether any element of paragraph (b) of the definition would apply to the item. One needs only review the “release” provisions in paragraph (b) of the “specially designed” definition if paragraph (a) of the “specially designed” definition applies to the item in a “control” paragraph of an ECCN that uses the term “specially designed.”
(5) Step 5. If an item is not classified by a “600 series” or in a 9x515 ECCN, then starting from the beginning of the product group analyze each ECCN to determine whether any other ECCN in that product group describes the item. If any ECCN uses the term “specially designed,” see Steps 4.a and 4.b above in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) respectively. If the item is described in one of these ECCNs, then the item is classified under that ECCN.
(6) Step 6. If the item is not described under any ECCN of any category of the CCL, then the item is designated as EAR99. EAR99 items may require a license if destined for a prohibited or restricted end user, end use or destination. See paragraphs (g) through (n) of § 732.3 “Steps Regarding the Ten General Prohibitions,” or General Prohibitions Four through Ten of part 736 of the EAR for license requirements other than those imposed by the CCL.

§ 781.2
Purposes of the Additional Protocol and APR.
(a)
General.
The Additional Protocol is a supplement to the existing U.S.-IAEA Safeguards Agreement, which entered into force in 1980. It provides the IAEA with access to additional information about civil nuclear and nuclear-related items, materials, and activities and with physical access to reportable locations where nuclear facilities, materials, or ores are located (to ensure the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities) and to other reportable locations and locations specified by the IAEA (to resolve questions or inconsistencies related to the U.S. Declaration). The Additional Protocol is based upon and is virtually identical to the IAEA Model Additional Protocol (see IAEA Information Circular, INFCIRC/540, at
http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/index.html
), except that it excludes IAEA access to activities with direct national security significance to the United States, or to locations or information associated with such activities, and provides for managed access in connection with those same activities and to locations or information associated with those activities.
(b)
Purposes of the Additional Protocol.
The Additional Protocol is designed to enhance the effectiveness of the U.S.-IAEA Safeguards Agreement by providing the IAEA with information about aspects of the U.S. civil nuclear fuel cycle, including: Mining and concentration of nuclear ores; nuclear-related equipment manufacturing, assembly, or construction; imports, exports, and other activities involving certain source material (i.e., source material that has not reached the composition and purity suitable for fuel fabrication or for being isotopically enriched); imports and exports of specified nuclear equipment and non-nuclear material; nuclear fuel cycle-related research and development activities not involving nuclear material; and other activities involving nuclear material not currently subject to the U.S.-IAEA Safeguards Agreement (e.g., nuclear material that has been exempted from safeguards pursuant to paragraph 37 of INFCIRC/153 (Corrected) June 1972).
(c)
Purposes of the Additional Protocol Regulations.
To fulfill certain obligations of the United States under the Additional Protocol, BIS has established the APR, which require the reporting of information to BIS (as described in parts 783 and 784 of the APR) from all persons and locations in the United States (as described in § 781.3(a) of the APR) with reportable activities. This information, together with information reported to other U.S. Government agencies and less any information to which the U.S. Government applies the national security exclusion, is aggregated into a U.S. declaration, which is submitted annually to the IAEA. The APR also provide for complementary access at such locations in accordance with the provisions in part 784 of the APR.
§ 781.3
Scope of the APR.
The Additional Protocol Regulations or APR implement certain obligations of the United States under the Protocol Additional to the Agreement Between the United States of America and the International Atomic Energy Agency Concerning the Application of Safeguards in the United States of America, known as the Additional Protocol.
(a)
Persons and locations subject to the APR.
The APR, promulgated by the Department of Commerce, shall apply to all persons and locations in the United States,
except
:
(1) Locations that are subject to the regulatory authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), pursuant to the NRC's regulatory jurisdiction under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011
et seq.
); and
(2) The following
United States Government locations
(see definition in § 781.1 of the APR):
(i) Department of Energy locations;
(ii) Department of Defense locations;
(iii) Central Intelligence Agency locations; and
(iv) Department of State locations.
(b)
Activities subject to the APR.
The activities that are subject to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements described in the APR are found in parts 783 and 784 of this subchapter (APR).
§ 781.4
U.S. Government requests for information needed to satisfy the requirements of the APR or the Act.
From time-to-time, one or more U.S. Government agencies (i.e., the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the NRC, or BIS) may contact a location to request information that the U.S. Government has determined to be necessary to satisfy certain requirements of the APR or the Act (e.g., clarification requests or vulnerability assessments). If the manner of providing such information is not specified in the APR, the agency in question will provide the location with appropriate instructions.
§ 781.5
Authority.
The APR implement certain provisions of the Additional Protocol under the authority of the Additional Protocol Implementation Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-401, 120 Stat. 2726 (December 18, 2006)). In Executive Order 13458 of February 4, 2008, the President delegated authority to the Department of Commerce to promulgate regulations to implement the Act, and consistent with the Act, to carry out appropriate functions not otherwise assigned in the Act, but necessary to implement certain declaration and complementary access requirements of the Additional Protocol and the Act.

If you commenced any of the civil nuclear fuel cycle-related activities described in this paragraph (a) after October 31, 2008, you must submit an
Initial Report
on these activities to BIS no later than January 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the activities commenced (see supplement no. 1 to this part). You may report these activities as part of your
Annual Update Report
, in lieu of submitting a separate
Initial Report
, if you also have an
Annual Update Report
requirement that applies to the same location and covers the same reporting period (see paragraph (b) of this section). In order to satisfy the
Initial Report
requirements under this paragraph (a), you must complete and submit to BIS Form AP-1, Form AP-2, and other appropriate Forms, as provided in this paragraph (a).
(1)
Research and development activities not involving nuclear material.
You must report to BIS any of the civil nuclear fuel cycle-related research and development activities identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section. Activities subject to these APR reporting requirements include research and development activities related to safe equipment operations for a nuclear fuel cycle-related activity, but do not include activities related to theoretical or basic scientific research or to research and development on industrial radioisotope applications, medical, hydrological and agricultural applications, health and environmental effects and improved maintenance.
(i) You must complete Form AP-3 and submit it to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, if you conducted any civil nuclear fuel cycle-related research and development activities defined in § 781.1 of the APR that:
(A) Did not involve nuclear material; and
(B) Were funded, specifically authorized or controlled by, or conducted on behalf of, the United States.
(ii) You must complete Form AP-4 and submit it to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, if you conducted any civil nuclear fuel cycle-related research and development activities defined in § 781.1 of the APR that:
(A) Did not involve nuclear material;
(B) Were specifically related to enrichment, reprocessing of nuclear fuel, or the processing of intermediate or high-level waste containing plutonium, high enriched uranium or uranium-233 (where “processing” involves the separation of elements); and
(C) Were not funded, specifically authorized or controlled by, or conducted on behalf of, the United States.
(2)
Civil nuclear-related manufacturing, assembly or construction activities.
You must complete Form AP-5 and submit it to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, if you engaged in any of the activities specified in supplement no. 2 to this part.
(3)
Uranium hard-rock mining and ore beneficiation activities.
You must complete Form AP-6 and submit it to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, if your location is either a uranium hard-rock mine or an ore beneficiation plant that was in operating or suspended status (see § 781.1 of the APR for the definitions of “uranium hard-rock mine” and uranium hard-rock mines in “operating,” “suspended,” or “closed-down” status).
(i) The
Initial Report
requirement for calendar year 2008 applies to:
(A) Uranium hard-rock mines or ore beneficiation plants that were in operating or suspended status on October 31, 2008; and
(B) Uranium hard-rock mines that have changed from operating or suspended status to closed-down status during calendar year 2008 (up to and including October 31, 2008). Mines that were closed down prior to calendar year 2008 and that remain in closed-down status do not have a reporting requirement.
(ii) You are required to submit an
Initial Report
to BIS, for any calendar year that follows calendar year 2008, only if you commenced operations at a uranium hard-rock mine or an ore beneficiation plant during the previous calendar year (e.g., the commencement of operations would include, but not be limited to, the resumption of operations at a mine that was previously in “closed-down” status). Otherwise, see the
Annual Update Report and No Changes Report
requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. For example, you must submit an
Annual Update Report
to indicate the closed-down status of any uranium hard-rock mine that was indicated in your most recent report to be in either operating or suspended status, but at which you ceased operations during the previous calendar year.
(b)
Annual reporting requirements.
You must submit either an
Annual Update Report
or a
No Changes Report
to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, if, during the previous calendar year, you continued to engage in civil nuclear fuel cycle-related activities at a location for which you submitted an
Initial Report
to BIS in accordance with the APR reporting requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section.
(1)
Annual Update Report.
You must submit an
Annual Update Report
to BIS if you have updates or changes to report concerning your location's activities during the previous calendar year. When preparing your
Annual Update Report
, you must complete the same report forms that you used for submitting your
Initial Report
on these activities. However, additional report forms will be required if your location engaged in any civil nuclear fuel cycle-related activities described in paragraph (a) of this section that you did not previously report to BIS. The appropriate report forms for each type of activity that must be reported under the APR are identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section. You must submit your
Annual Update Report
to BIS no later than January 31 of the year following any calendar year in which the activities took place or there were changes to previously “reported” activities (see supplement no. 1 to this part).
(2)
No Changes Report.
You may submit a
No Changes Report
, in lieu of an
Annual Update Report
, if you have no updates or changes concerning your location's activities (except the certifying official and dates signed and submitted) since your most recent report of activities to BIS. In order to satisfy the reporting requirements under this paragraph (b)(2), you must complete Form AP-16 and submit it to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, no later than January 31 of the year following any calendar year in which there were no changes to previously “reported” activities or location information (see supplement no. 1 to this part).
(3)
Additional guidance on annual reporting requirements.
(i) If your
Initial Report
or your most recent
Annual Update Report
for a location indicates that all civil nuclear fuel cycle-related activities described therein have ceased at that location, and no other reportable activities have occurred during
the previous calendar year, then you do not have a reporting requirement for the location under paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) If your location ceases to engage in activities subject to the APR reporting requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section, and you have not previously reported this to BIS, you must submit an
Annual Update Report
covering the calendar year in which you ceased to engage in such activities.
(iii) Closed-down mines should be reported only once.
(c)
Import Confirmation Report.
You must complete Forms AP-1, AP-2 and AP-14 for each import of equipment or non-nuclear material identified in supplement no. 3 to this part and submit these forms to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, if BIS sends you written notification requiring that you provide information concerning imports of such equipment and non-nuclear material. These Forms must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the date that you receive written notification of this requirement from BIS (see supplement no. 1 to this part). BIS will provide such notification when it receives a request from the IAEA for information concerning imports of this type of equipment or non-nuclear material. The IAEA may request this information to verify that you received specified equipment or non-nuclear material that was shipped to you by a person, organization, or government from a foreign country.
(d)
Supplemental Information Report.
You must complete Forms AP-1, AP-2 and AP-15 and submit them to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, if BIS sends you written notification requiring that you provide information about the activities conducted at your location, insofar as relevant for the purpose of safeguards. These Forms must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date that you receive written notification of this requirement from BIS (see supplement no. 1 to this part). BIS will provide such notification only if the IAEA specifically requests amplification or clarification concerning any information provided in the U.S. Declaration based on your report(s).
(e)
Reportable location.
A location that must submit an
Initial Report, Annual Update Report, or No Changes Report
to BIS, pursuant to the requirements of this section, is considered to be a reportable location with declared activities.

Pt. 783, Supp. No. 3

# Supplement No. 3 to Part 783—List of Specified Equipment and Non-Nuclear Material for the Reporting of Imports

# 1. Reactors and equipment therefor

# 1.1. Complete nuclear reactors
Nuclear reactors capable of operation so as to maintain a controlled self-sustaining fission chain reaction, excluding zero energy reactors, the latter being defined as reactors with a designed maximum rate of production of plutonium not exceeding 100 grams per year.

# Explanatory Note:
A “nuclear reactor” basically includes the items within or attached directly to the reactor vessel, the equipment which controls the level of power in the core, and the components which normally contain or come in direct contact with or control the primary coolant of the reactor core. It is not intended to exclude reactors which could reasonably be capable of modification to produce significantly more than 100 grams of plutonium per year. Reactors designed for sustained operation at significant power levels, regardless of their capacity for plutonium production, are not considered as “zero energy reactors.”

# 1.2. Reactor pressure vessels
Metal vessels, as complete units or as major shop-fabricated parts therefor, which are specially designed or prepared to contain the core of a nuclear reactor, as defined in section 1.1, and are capable of withstanding the operating pressure of the primary coolant.

# Explanatory Note:
This is the list that the IAEA Board of Governors agreed at its meeting on 24 February 1993 would be used for the purpose of the voluntary reporting scheme, as subsequently amended by the Board. A top plate for a reactor pressure vessel is covered by this section 1.2 as a major shop-fabricated part of a pressure vessel. Reactor internals (e.g., support columns and plates for the core and other vessel internals, control rod guide tubes, thermal shields, baffles, core grid plates, diffuser plates, etc.) are normally supplied by the reactor supplier. In some cases, certain internal support components are included in the fabrication of the pressure vessel. These items are sufficiently critical to the safety and reliability of the operation of the reactor (and, therefore, to the guarantees and liability of the reactor supplier), so that their supply, outside the basic supply arrangement for the reactor itself, would not be common practice. Therefore, although the separate supply of these unique, specially designed and prepared, critical, large and expensive items would not necessarily be considered as falling outside the area of concern, such a mode of supply is considered unlikely.

# 1.3. Reactor fuel charging and discharging machines
Manipulative equipment specially designed or prepared for inserting or removing fuel in a nuclear reactor, as defined in section 1.1 of this Supplement, capable of on-load operation or employing technically sophisticated positioning or alignment features to allow complex off-load fueling operations such as those in which direct viewing of or access to the fuel is not normally available.

# 1.4. Reactor control rods
Rods specially designed or prepared for the control of the reaction rate in a nuclear reactor as defined in section 1.1 of this Supplement.

# Explanatory Note:
This item includes, in addition to the neutron absorbing part, the support or suspension structures therefor if supplied separately.

# 1.5. Reactor pressure tubes
Tubes which are specially designed or prepared to contain fuel elements and the primary coolant in a reactor, as defined in section 1.1 of this supplement, at an operating pressure in excess of 5.1 MPa (740 psi).

# 1.6. Zirconium tubes
Zirconium metal and alloys in the form of tubes or assemblies of tubes, and in quantities exceeding 500 kg in any period of 12 months, specially designed or prepared for use in a reactor, as defined in section 1.1 of this supplement, and in which the relation of hafnium to zirconium is less than 1:500 parts by weight.

# 1.7. Primary coolant pumps
Pumps specially designed or prepared for circulating the primary coolant for nuclear reactors, as defined in section 1.1 of this Supplement.

# Explanatory Note:
Specially designed or prepared pumps may include elaborate sealed or multi-sealed systems to prevent leakage of primary coolant, canned-driven pumps, and pumps with inertial mass systems. This definition encompasses pumps certified to NC-1 or equivalent standards.

# 2. Non-nuclear materials for reactors

# 2.1. Deuterium and heavy water
Deuterium, heavy water (deuterium oxide) and any other deuterium compound in which the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen atoms exceeds 1:5000 for use in a nuclear reactor, as defined in section 1.1 of this supplement, in quantities exceeding 200 kg of deuterium atoms for any one recipient country in any period of 12 months.

# 2.2. Nuclear grade graphite
Graphite having a purity level better than 5 parts per million boron equivalent and with a density greater than 1.50 g/cm
3
for use in a nuclear reactor, as defined in section 1.1 of this Supplement, in quantities exceeding 3 × 10
4
kg (30 metric tons) for any one recipient country in any period of 12 months.

# Note:
For the purpose of reporting, the Government will determine whether or not the exports of graphite meeting the specifications of this section 2.2 are for nuclear reactor use.

# 3. Plants for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel elements, and equipment specially designed or prepared therefor

# Introductory Note:
Reprocessing irradiated nuclear fuel separates plutonium and uranium from intensely radioactive fission products and other transuranic elements. Different technical processes can accomplish this separation. However, over the years Purex has become the most commonly used and accepted process. Purex involves the dissolution of irradiated nuclear fuel in nitric acid, followed by separation of the uranium, plutonium, and fission products by solvent extraction using a mixture of tributyl phosphate in an organic diluent. Purex facilities have process functions similar to each other, including: Irradiated fuel element chopping, fuel dissolution, solvent extraction, and process liquor storage. There may also be equipment for thermal denitration of uranium nitrate, conversion of plutonium nitrate to oxide or metal, and treatment of fission product waste liquor to a form suitable for long term storage or disposal. However, the specific type and configuration of the equipment performing these functions may differ between Purex facilities for several reasons, including the type and quantity of irradiated nuclear fuel to be reprocessed and the intended disposition of the recovered materials, and the safety and maintenance philosophy incorporated into the design of the facility. A “plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel elements” includes the equipment and components which normally come in direct contact with and directly control the irradiated fuel and the major nuclear material and fission product processing streams. These processes, including the complete systems for plutonium conversion and plutonium metal production, may be identified by the measures taken to avoid criticality (e.g., by geometry), radiation exposure (e.g., by shielding), and toxicity hazards (e.g., by containment). Items of equipment that are considered to fall within the meaning of the phrase “and equipment specially designed or prepared” for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel elements include:

# 3.1. Irradiated fuel element chopping machines

# Introductory Note:
This equipment breaches the cladding of the fuel to expose the irradiated nuclear material to dissolution. Specially designed metal cutting shears are the most commonly employed, although advanced equipment, such as lasers, may be used. Remotely operated equipment specially designed or prepared for use in a reprocessing plant, as identified in the introductory paragraph of this section, and intended to cut, chop or shear irradiated nuclear fuel assemblies, bundles or rods.

# 3.2. Dissolvers

# Introductory Note:
Dissolvers normally receive the chopped-up spent fuel. In these critically safe vessels, the irradiated nuclear material is dissolved in nitric acid and the remaining hulls removed from the process stream. Critically safe tanks (
e.g.
, small diameter, annular or slab tanks) specially designed or prepared for use in a reprocessing
plant, as identified in the introductory paragraph of this section, intended for dissolution of irradiated nuclear fuel and which are capable of withstanding hot, highly corrosive liquid, and which can be remotely loaded and maintained.

# 3.3. Solvent extractors and solvent extraction equipment

# Introductory Note:
Solvent extractors both receive the solution of irradiated fuel from the dissolvers and the organic solution which separates the uranium, plutonium, and fission products. Solvent extraction equipment is normally designed to meet strict operating parameters, such as long operating lifetimes with no maintenance requirements or adaptability to easy replacement, simplicity of operation and control, and flexibility for variations in process conditions. Specially designed or prepared solvent extractors such as packed or pulse columns, mixer settlers or centrifugal contactors for use in a plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. Solvent extractors must be resistant to the corrosive effect of nitric acid. Solvent extractors are normally fabricated to extremely high standards (including special welding and inspection and quality assurance and quality control techniques) out of low carbon stainless steels, titanium, zirconium, or other high quality materials.

# 3.4. Chemical holding or storage vessels

# Introductory Note:
Three main process liquor streams result from the solvent extraction step. Holding or storage vessels are used in the further processing of all three streams, as follows:
(a) The pure uranium nitrate solution is concentrated by evaporation and passed to a denitration process where it is converted to uranium oxide. This oxide is re-used in the nuclear fuel cycle.
(b) The intensely radioactive fission products solution is normally concentrated by evaporation and stored as a liquor concentrate. This concentrate may be subsequently evaporated and converted to a form suitable for storage or disposal.
(c) The pure plutonium nitrate solution is concentrated and stored pending its transfer to further process steps. In particular, holding or storage vessels for plutonium solutions are designed to avoid criticality problems resulting from changes in concentration and form of this stream. Specially designed or prepared holding or storage vessels for use in a plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. The holding or storage vessels must be resistant to the corrosive effect of nitric acid. The holding or storage vessels are normally fabricated of materials such as low carbon stainless steels, titanium or zirconium, or other high quality materials. Holding or storage vessels may be designed for remote operation and maintenance and may have the following features for control of nuclear criticality: (1) Walls or internal structures with a boron equivalent of at least two percent; (2) a maximum diameter of 175 mm (7 in) for cylindrical vessels; or (3) a maximum width of 75 mm (3 in) for either a slab or annular vessel.

# 3.5. Plutonium nitrate to oxide conversion system

# Introductory Note:
In most reprocessing facilities, this final process involves the conversion of the plutonium nitrate solution to plutonium dioxide. The main functions involved in this process are: process feed storage and adjustment, precipitation and solid/liquor separation, calcination, product handling, ventilation, waste management, and process control. Complete systems specially designed or prepared for the conversion of plutonium nitrate to plutonium oxide, in particular adapted so as to avoid criticality and radiation effects and to minimize toxicity hazards.

# 3.6. Plutonium oxide to metal production system

# Introductory Note:
This process, which could be related to a reprocessing facility, involves the fluorination of plutonium dioxide, normally with highly corrosive hydrogen fluoride, to produce plutonium fluoride which is subsequently reduced using high purity calcium metal to produce metallic plutonium and a calcium fluoride slag. The main functions involved in this process are: fluorination (e.g., involving equipment fabricated or lined with a precious metal), metal reduction (e.g., employing ceramic crucibles), slag recovery, product handling, ventilation, waste management and process control. Complete systems specially designed or prepared for the production of plutonium metal, in particular adapted so as to avoid criticality and radiation effects and to minimize toxicity hazards.

Items of equipment that are considered to fall within the meaning of the phrase
“equipment, other than analytical instruments, specially designed or prepared” for the separation of isotopes of uranium include:

# 5.1. Gas centrifuges and assemblies and components specially designed or prepared for use in gas centrifuges

# Introductory Note:
The gas centrifuge normally consists of a thin-walled cylinder(s) of between 75 mm (3 in) and 400 mm (16 in) diameter contained in a vacuum environment and spun at high peripheral speed of the order of 300 m/s or more with its central axis vertical. In order to achieve high speed the materials of construction for the rotating components have to be of a high strength to density ratio and the rotor assembly, and hence its individual components, have to be manufactured to very close tolerances in order to minimize the unbalance. In contrast to other centrifuges, the gas centrifuge for uranium enrichment is characterized by having within the rotor chamber a rotating disc-shaped baffle(s) and a stationary tube arrangement for feeding and extracting the UF
6
gas and featuring at least 3 separate channels, of which 2 are connected to scoops extending from the rotor axis towards the periphery of the rotor chamber. Also contained within the vacuum environment are a number of critical items which do not rotate and which although they are specially designed are not difficult to fabricate nor are they fabricated out of unique materials.

# 5.2. Specially designed or prepared auxiliary systems, equipment and components for gas centrifuge enrichment plants

# Introductory Note:
The auxiliary systems, equipment and components for a gas centrifuge enrichment plant are the systems of plant needed to feed UF6 to the centrifuges, to link the individual centrifuges to each other to form cascades (or stages) to allow for progressively higher enrichments and to extract the “product” and “tails” UF6 from the centrifuges, together with the equipment required to drive the centrifuges or to control the plant. Normally UF
6
is evaporated from the solid using heated autoclaves and is distributed in gaseous form to the centrifuges by way of cascade header pipework. The “product” and “tails” UF
6
gaseous streams flowing from the centrifuges are also passed by way of cascade header pipework to cold traps (operating at about 203 K (−70 °C)) where they are condensed prior to onward transfer into suitable containers for transportation or storage. Because an enrichment plant consists of many thousands of centrifuges arranged in cascades there are many kilometers of cascade header pipework, incorporating thousands of welds with a substantial amount of repetition of layout. The equipment, components and piping systems are fabricated to very high vacuum and cleanliness standards.

# Introductory Note:
In the gaseous diffusion method of uranium isotope separation, the main technological assembly is a special porous gaseous diffusion barrier, heat exchanger for cooling the gas (which is heated by the process of compression), seal valves and control valves, and pipelines. Inasmuch as gaseous diffusion technology uses uranium hexafluoride (UF
6
), all equipment, pipeline and instrumentation surfaces (that come in contact with the gas) must be made of materials that remain stable in contact with UF
6
. A gaseous diffusion facility requires a number of these assemblies, so that quantities can provide an important indication of end use.

# 5.4. Specially designed or prepared auxiliary systems, equipment and components for use in gaseous diffusion enrichment

# Introductory Note:
The auxiliary systems, equipment and components for gaseous diffusion enrichment plants are the systems of plant needed to feed UF
6
to the gaseous diffusion assembly, to link the individual assemblies to each other to form cascades (or stages) to allow for progressively higher enrichments and to extract the “product” and “tails” UF
6
from the diffusion cascades. Because of the high inertial properties of diffusion cascades, any interruption in their operation, and especially their shut-down, leads to serious consequences. Therefore, a strict and constant maintenance of vacuum in all technological systems, automatic protection from accidents, and precise automated regulation of the gas flow is of importance in a gaseous diffusion plant. All this leads to a need to equip the plant with a large number of special measuring, regulating and controlling systems. Normally UF
6
is evaporated from cylinders placed within autoclaves and is distributed in gaseous form to the entry point by way of cascade header pipework. The “product” and “tails” UF
6
gaseous streams flowing from exit points are passed by way of cascade header pipework to either cold traps or to compression stations where the UF
6
gas is liquefied prior to onward transfer into suitable containers for transportation or storage. Because a gaseous diffusion enrichment plant consists of a large number of gaseous diffusion assemblies arranged in cascades, there are many kilometers of cascade header pipework, incorporating thousands of welds with substantial amounts of repetition of layout. The equipment, components and piping systems are fabricated to very high vacuum and cleanliness standards.

In aerodynamic enrichment processes, a mixture of gaseous UF

Two processes of this type have been successfully developed: The separation nozzle process and the vortex tube process. For
both processes the main components of a separation stage include cylindrical vessels housing the special separation elements (nozzles or vortex tubes), gas compressors and heat exchangers to remove the heat of compression. An aerodynamic plant requires a number of these stages, so that quantities can provide an important indication of end use. Since aerodynamic processes use UF
6
, all equipment, pipeline and instrumentation surfaces (that come in contact with the gas) must be made of materials that remain stable in contact with UF

# 5.6. Specially designed or prepared systems, equipment and components for use in chemical exchange or ion exchange enrichment plants

# Introductory Note:
The slight difference in mass between the isotopes of uranium causes small changes in chemical reaction equilibria that can be used as a basis for separation of the isotopes. Two processes have been successfully developed: Liquid-liquid chemical exchange and solid-liquid ion exchange. In the liquid-liquid chemical exchange process, immiscible liquid phases (aqueous and organic) are countercurrently contacted to give the cascading effect of thousands of separation stages. The aqueous phase consists of uranium chloride in hydrochloric acid solution; the organic phase consists of an extractant containing uranium chloride in an organic solvent. The contactors employed in the separation cascade can be liquid-liquid exchange columns (such as pulsed columns with sieve plates) or liquid centrifugal contactors. Chemical conversions (oxidation and reduction) are required at both ends of the separation cascade in order to provide for the reflux requirements at each end. A major design concern is to avoid contamination of the process streams with certain metal ions. Plastic, plastic-lined (including use of fluorocarbon polymers) and/or glass-lined columns and piping are therefore used. In the solid-liquid ion-exchange process, enrichment is accomplished by uranium adsorption/desorption on a special, very fast-acting, ion-exchange resin or adsorbent. A solution of uranium in hydrochloric acid and other chemical agents is passed through cylindrical enrichment columns containing packed beds of the adsorbent. For a continuous process, a reflux system is necessary to release the uranium from the adsorbent back into the liquid flow so that “product” and “tails” can be collected. This is accomplished with the use of suitable reduction/oxidation chemical agents that are fully regenerated in separate external circuits and that may be partially regenerated within the isotopic separation columns themselves. The presence of hot concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions in the process requires that the equipment be made of or protected by special corrosion-resistant materials.

# 6. Plants for the production of heavy water, deuterium and deuterium compounds and equipment specially designed or prepared therefor

# Introductory Note:
Heavy water can be produced by a variety of processes. However, the two processes that have proven to be commercially viable are the water-hydrogen sulfide exchange process (GS process) and the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process. The GS process is based upon the exchange of hydrogen and deuterium between water and hydrogen sulfide within a series of towers which are operated with the top section cold and the bottom section hot. Water flows down the towers while the hydrogen sulfide gas circulates from the bottom to the top of the towers. A series of perforated trays are used to promote mixing between the gas and the water. Deuterium migrates to the water at low temperatures and to the hydrogen sulfide at high temperatures. Gas or water, enriched in deuterium, is removed from the first stage towers at the junction of the hot and cold sections and the process is repeated in subsequent stage towers. The product of the last stage, water enriched up to 30% in deuterium, is sent to a distillation unit to produce reactor grade heavy water, i.e., 99.75% deuterium oxide. The ammonia-hydrogen exchange process can extract deuterium from synthesis gas through contact with liquid ammonia in the presence of a
catalyst. The synthesis gas is fed into exchange towers and to an ammonia converter. Inside the towers the gas flows from the bottom to the top while the liquid ammonia flows from the top to the bottom. The deuterium is stripped from the hydrogen in the synthesis gas and concentrated in the ammonia. The ammonia then flows into an ammonia cracker at the bottom of the tower while the gas flows into an ammonia converter at the top. Further enrichment takes place in subsequent stages and reactor grade heavy water is produced through final distillation. The synthesis gas feed can be provided by an ammonia plant that, in turn, can be constructed in association with a heavy water ammonia-hydrogen exchange plant. The ammonia-hydrogen exchange process can also use ordinary water as a feed source of deuterium.
Many of the key equipment items for heavy water production plants using GS or the ammonia-hydrogen exchange processes are common to several segments of the chemical and petroleum industries. This is particularly so for small plants using the GS process. However, few of the items are available “off-the-shelf.” The GS and ammonia-hydrogen processes require the handling of large quantities of flammable, corrosive and toxic fluids at elevated pressures. Accordingly, in establishing the design and operating standards for plants and equipment using these processes, careful attention to the materials selection and specifications is required to ensure long service life with high safety and reliability factors. The choice of scale is primarily a function of economics and need. Thus, most of the equipment items would be prepared according to the requirements of the customer. Finally, it should be noted that, in both the GS and the ammonia-hydrogen exchange processes, items of equipment which individually are not specially designed or prepared for heavy water production can be assembled into systems which are specially designed or prepared for producing heavy water. The catalyst production system used in the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process and water distillation systems used for the final concentration of heavy water to reactor-grade in either process are examples of such systems. The items of equipment which are specially designed or prepared for the production of heavy water utilizing either the water-hydrogen sulfide exchange process or the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process include the following:

# Note to § 784.1(
d

# ):
BIS may invite representatives from other U.S. Government agencies to participate as members of the Advance and Host Teams for complementary access. The Host Team will not include employees of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor.
§ 784.2
Obtaining consent or warrants to conduct complementary access.
(a)
Procedures for obtaining consent.
(1) For locations specified in the U.S. declaration and other locations specified by the IAEA, BIS will seek consent pursuant to IAEA complementary access requests. In instances where the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of a location does not consent to such complementary access, BIS will seek administrative warrants as provided by the Act.
(2) For locations specified by the IAEA where access cannot be provided, BIS may seek consent from an adjacent location pursuant to an IAEA complementary access request.
(b)
Who may give consent.
The owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of a location may consent to complementary access. The individual providing consent on behalf of the location represents that he or she has the authority to make this decision.
(c)
Scope of consent.
(1) When the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of a location consents to a complementary access request, he or she is agreeing to provide the IAEA Team with the same degree of access as that authorized under § 784.3 of the APR. This includes providing access for the IAEA Team and Host Team to any area of the location, any item on the location, and any records that are necessary to comply with the APR and allow the IAEA Team to accomplish the purpose of complementary access, as authorized under § 784.1(b)(1) or (b)(2) of the APR, except for the following:
(i) Information subject to the licensing jurisdiction of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), U.S. Department of State, under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120 through 130)—see § 784.3(b)(3) of the APR, which states that such access cannot be provided without prior U.S. Government authorization; and
(ii) Activities with direct national security significance to the United States, or locations or information associated with such activities.
(2) The Host Team Leader is responsible for determining whether or not the IAEA's request to obtain access to any area, building, or item, or to record or conduct the types of activities described in § 784.3 of the APR is consistent with the Additional Protocol and subsidiary arrangements to the Additional Protocol.
§ 784.3
Scope and conduct of complementary access.
(a)
General.
IAEA complementary access shall be limited to accomplishing only those purposes that are appropriate to the type of location, as indicated in § 784.1(b) of the APR and shall be conducted in the least intrusive manner, consistent with the effective and timely accomplishment of such purposes. No complementary access may take place without the presence of a U.S. Government Host Team. No information of direct national security
significance shall be provided to the IAEA during complementary access.
(b)
Scope.
This paragraph describes complementary access activities that are authorized under the APR.
(1)
Complementary access activities.
Depending on the type of location accessed, the IAEA Team may:
(i) Perform visual observation of parts or areas of the location;
(ii) Utilize radiation detection and measurement devices;
(iii) Utilize non-destructive measurements and sampling;
(iv) Examine relevant records (i.e., records appropriate for the purpose of complementary access, as authorized under § 784.1(b) of the APR), except that the following records may not be inspected unless the Host Team leader, after receiving input from representatives of the location and consulting with other members of the Host Team, determines that such access is both appropriate and necessary to achieve the relevant purpose described in § 784.1(b)(1) or (b)(2) of the APR:
(A) Financial data (other than production data);
(B) Sales and marketing data (other than shipment data);
(C) Pricing data;
(D) Personnel data;
(E) Patent data;
(F) Data maintained for compliance with environmental or occupational health and safety regulations; or
(G) Research data (unless the data are reported on Form AP-3 or AP-4);
(v) Perform location-specific environmental sampling; and

# Note to § 784.3(
b

# )(1)(
v

# ):
BIS will not seek access to a location for location-specific environmental sampling until the President reports to the appropriate congressional committees his determination to permit such sampling.
(vi) Utilize other objective measures which have been demonstrated to be technically feasible and the use of which have been agreed to by the United States (“objective measures,” as used herein, means any verification techniques that would be appropriate for achieving the official purpose of complementary access, both in terms of their effectiveness and limited intrusiveness).
(2)
Wide Area Environmental Sampling.
In certain cases, IAEA inspectors may collect environmental samples (e.g., air, water, vegetation, soil, smears), at a location specified by the IAEA, for the purpose of assisting the IAEA to draw conclusions about the absence of undeclared nuclear material or nuclear activities over a wide area.

# Note to § 784.3(
b

# )(2):
The IAEA will not seek such access until the use of wide-area environmental sampling and the procedural arrangements therefor have been approved by its Board of Governors and consultations have been held between the IAEA and the United States. BIS will not seek access to a location for wide-area sampling until the President reports to the appropriate congressional committees his determination to permit such sampling.
(3)
ITAR-controlled technology.
ITAR-controlled technology shall not be made available to the IAEA Team without prior U.S. Government authorization. The owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the location being accessed is responsible for identifying any ITAR-controlled technology at the location to the Host Team as soon as practicable following the receipt of notification from BIS of complementary access (see § 784.4(a) of the APR).
(c)
Briefing.
Following the arrival of the IAEA Team and Host Team at a location subject to complementary access, and prior to the commencement of complementary access, representatives of the organization will provide the IAEA Team and Host Team with a briefing on the environmental, health, safety, and security regulations (e.g., regulations for protection of controlled environments within the location and for personal safety) that are applicable to the location and which must be observed. In addition, the organization's representatives may include in their briefing an overview of the location, the activities carried out at the location, and any administrative and logistical arrangements relevant to complementary access. The briefing may include the use of maps and other documentation deemed appropriate by the organization. The time spent for the briefing may not exceed one hour, and the content should be limited to that which relates to the purpose of
complementary access. The briefing may also address any of the following:
(1) Areas, buildings, and structures specific to any activities relevant to complementary access;
(2) Administrative and logistical information;
(3) Updates/revisions to reports required under the APR;
(4) Introduction of key personnel at the location;
(5) Location-specific subsidiary arrangement, if applicable; and
(6) Proposed access plan to address the purpose of complementary access.
(d)
Visual access.
The IAEA Team may visually observe areas or parts of the location, as agreed by the Host Team Leader, after the Host Team Leader has consulted with the organization's representative for the location.
(e)
Records review.
The location must be prepared to provide the IAEA Team with access to all supporting materials and documentation used by the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the location to prepare reports required under the APR and to otherwise comply with the APR (see the records inspection and recordkeeping requirements in §§ 786.1 and 786.2 of the APR and paragraph (b) of this section, which describes the scope of complementary access activities authorized under the APR) and with appropriate accommodations in which the IAEA Team can review these supporting materials and documentation. Such access will be provided in appropriate formats (e.g., paper copies, electronic remote access by computer, microfilm, or microfiche) through the Host Team to the IAEA Team during the complementary access period or as otherwise agreed upon by the IAEA Team and Host Team Leader. If the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the location does not have access to records for activities that took place under previous ownership, the previous owner must make such records available to the Host Team.
(f)
Managed access.
As necessary, the Host Team will implement managed access measures (e.g., the removal of sensitive papers from office spaces and the shrouding of sensitive displays, stores, and equipment) to prevent the dissemination of proliferation sensitive information, to meet safety or physical protection requirements, to protect proprietary or commercially sensitive information, or to protect activities of direct national security significance to the United States, including locations or information associated with such activities. If the IAEA Team is unable to fully achieve its inspection aims under the managed access measures in place, the Host Team will make every reasonable effort to provide alternative means to allow the IAEA Team to meet these aims, consistent with the purposes of complementary access (as described in § 784.1(b) of the APR) and the requirements of this section. If a location-specific subsidiary arrangement applies (see § 784.5(b) of the APR), the Host Team shall, in consultation with the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the location, implement managed access procedures consistent with the applicable location-specific subsidiary arrangement.
(g)
Hours of complementary access.
Consistent with the provisions of the Additional Protocol, the Host Team will ensure, to the extent possible, that each complementary access is commenced, conducted, and concluded during ordinary business hours, but no complementary access shall be prohibited or otherwise disrupted from commencing, continuing or concluding during other hours.
(h)
Environmental, health, safety, and security regulations and requirements.
In carrying out their activities, the IAEA Team and Host Team shall observe federal, state, and local environmental, health, safety, and security regulations and environmental, health, safety, and security requirements established at the location, including those for the protection of controlled environments within a location and for personal safety. To the extent practicable, any such regulations and requirements that may apply to the conduct of complementary access at the location should be set forth in the location-specific subsidiary arrangement (if any).
(i)
Host Team to accompany the IAEA Team.
The Host Team shall accompany the IAEA Team, during their complementary access at the location, in
accordance with the provisions set forth in this part of the APR.
(j)
Scope of authorized communications by the IAEA Team.
(1) The United States shall permit and protect free communications between the IAEA Team and IAEA Headquarters and/or Regional Offices, including attended and unattended transmission of information generated by IAEA containment and/or surveillance or measurement devices. The IAEA Team shall have the right, through consultation with the Host Team, to make use of internationally established systems of direct communications.
(2) No document, photograph or other recorded medium, or sample relevant to complementary access may be removed or transmitted from the location by the IAEA Team without the prior consent of the Host Team.
(k)
IAEA activities, findings, and results related to complementary access.
(1) In accordance with the Additional Protocol, the IAEA shall inform the United States of:
(i) Any activities that took place in connection with complementary access to a location in the United States, including any activities concerning questions or inconsistencies that the IAEA may have brought to the attention of the United States, within 60 calendar days of the time that the activities occurred; and
(ii) The findings or results of any activities that took place, including the findings and results of activities concerning questions or inconsistencies that the IAEA may have brought to the attention of the United States, within 30 calendar days of the time that such findings or results were reached by the IAEA.
(2) BIS will provide the results of complementary access to the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the inspected location to the extent practicable.
§ 784.4
Notification, duration and frequency of complementary access.
(a)
Complementary access notification.
Complementary access will be provided only upon the issuance of a written notice by BIS to the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises to be accessed. If BIS is unable to provide written notification to the owner, operator, or agent in charge, BIS may post a notice prominently at the location to be accessed.
(1)
Content of notice
—(i)
Pertinent information furnished by the IAEA.
The notice shall include all appropriate information provided by the IAEA to the United States Government concerning:
(A) The purpose of complementary access;
(B) The basis for the selection of the location for complementary access;
(C) The activities that will be carried out during complementary access;
(D) The time and date that complementary access is expected to begin and its anticipated duration; and
(E) The names and titles of the IAEA inspectors who will participate in complementary access.
(ii)
Request for location's consent to complementary access.
The complementary access notification from BIS will request that the location inform BIS whether or not it will consent to complementary access. If a location does not agree to provide consent to complementary access within four hours of its receipt of the complementary access notification, BIS will seek an administrative warrant as provided in § 784.2(a)(1).
(iii)
Availability of advance team from BIS.
An advance team from BIS will be available to assist the location in preparing for complementary access. If the complementary access is a 24-hour advance notice, then the availability of an advance team may be limited. The location requesting advance team assistance will not be required to reimburse the U.S. Government for any costs associated with these activities. The location (in cooperation with the advance team, if available) will make preparations for complementary access, including the identification of any ITAR-controlled technology and/or national security information at the location (see § 784.3(b)(3) of the APR).
(2)
Notification procedures.
The following table sets forth the notification procedures for complementary access.
Table to § 784.4(
a
)(2)
Activity
Agency action
Location action
IAEA notification of complementary access
BIS will transmit complementary access notification via facsimile to the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of a location to ascertain whether or not the location:
(1) Grants consent to complementary access; and
(2) Requests BIS advance team support (subject to availability) in preparing for complementary access.
Location must inform BIS, within 4 hours of its receipt of complementary access notification, whether or not it:
(1) Grants consent to complementary access; and
(2) Requests BIS advance team support (subject to availability) to prepare for complementary access. Location not required to reimburse U.S. Government for assistance from the BIS advance team.
If the location does not inform BIS of its consent to complementary access, within 4 hours of the time it receives notification from BIS, BIS will seek an administrative warrant.
Preparation for complementary access
If a BIS advance team has been requested and is available, it will arrive at the location to be accessed and assist the location in making logistical and administrative preparations for complementary access.
The location will engage in activities that will prepare the location for complementary access (e.g., identifying any ITAR-controlled technology or national security information at the location), either singularly or in cooperation with a BIS advance team if one has been requested and is available.
(3)
Timing of notification.
In accordance with the Additional Protocol, the IAEA shall notify the United States Government of a complementary access request not less than 24 hours prior to the arrival of the IAEA Team at the location. BIS will provide written notice to the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of the location as soon as possible after BIS has received notification from the IAEA.
(b)
Duration of complementary access.
The duration of complementary access will depend upon the nature of the complementary access request and the activities that will be conducted at the location. (See § 784.3(b) of the APR for a description of the types of complementary access activities authorized under the APR.)
§ 784.5
Subsidiary arrangements.
(a)
General subsidiary arrangement.
The United States Government may conclude a general subsidiary arrangement with the IAEA that governs complementary access activities, irrespective of the location (i.e., an arrangement that is not location-specific).
(b)
Location-specific subsidiary arrangement
—(1)
Purpose.
If requested by the location or deemed necessary by the U.S. Government, the U.S. Government will negotiate a location-specific subsidiary arrangement with the IAEA. The purpose of such an arrangement is to establish procedures for conducting managed access at a specific declared location. If the location requests, it may participate in preparations for the negotiation of a location-specific subsidiary arrangement with the IAEA and may observe the negotiations to the maximum extent practicable. The existence of a location-specific subsidiary arrangement does not in any way limit the right of the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the location to withhold consent to a request for complementary access.
(2)
Format and content.
The form and content of a location-specific subsidiary arrangement will be determined by the IAEA and the U.S. Government, in consultation with the location, on a case-by-case basis.
§ 784.6
Post complementary access activities.
Upon receiving the IAEA's final report on complementary access, BIS will forward a copy of the report to the location for its review, in accordance with § 784.3(k)(2) of the APR. Locations may submit comments concerning the IAEA's final report to BIS, and BIS will consider them, as appropriate, when preparing its comments to the IAEA on the final report. BIS also will send locations a post complementary access letter detailing the issues that require follow-up action (see, for example, the
Amended Report
requirements in § 783.2(d) of the APR).

§ 785.3
Initiation of administrative proceedings.
(a)
Issuance of a Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA).
Prior to the initiation of an administrative proceeding through issuance of a NOVA, the Bureau of Industry and Security will issue a letter of intent to charge. The letter of intent to charge will advise a respondent that BIS has conducted an investigation. The letter will give the respondent a specified period of time to contact BIS to discuss settlement of the allegations set forth in the letter of intent to charge. If the respondent does not contact BIS in the time period specified in the letter of intent to charge, the Director of the Office of Export Enforcement, or such other Department of Commerce representative designated by the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement, may initiate an administrative enforcement proceeding under this § 785.3 by issuing a NOVA.
(b)
Content of a NOVA.
The NOVA shall constitute a formal complaint and will set forth the alleged violation(s) and the essential facts with respect to the alleged violation(s), reference the relevant statutory, regulatory or other provisions, and state the maximum amount of the civil penalty that could be assessed. The NOVA also will inform the respondent of the requirement to request a hearing pursuant to § 785.4 of the APR.
(c)
Service of a NOVA.
Service of the NOVA shall be made by certified mail or courier delivery with signed acknowledgment of receipt. The date of signed acknowledgment of receipt shall be the effective date of service of the NOVA. One copy of each paper shall be provided to each party in the delivery. BIS files the NOVA with the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) at the same time that it is sent to the respondent. The ALJ, in turn, will place the case on its docket and will notify both the respondent and BIS of the docket information.
§ 785.4
Request for hearing and answer.
(a)
Deadline for answering the NOVA.
If the respondent wishes to contest the NOVA issued by BIS, the respondent must submit a written request for a hearing to BIS within 15 business days from the date of service of the NOVA. If the respondent requests a hearing, the respondent must answer the NOVA within 30 calendar days from the date of the request for hearing. The request for a hearing and the respondent's answer to the NOVA must be filed with the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), along with a copy of the NOVA, and served on the Office of Chief Counsel,
and any other address(es) specified in the NOVA, in accordance with § 785.6 of the APR.
(b)
Content of respondent's answer.
The respondent's answer must be responsive to the NOVA and must fully set forth the nature of the respondent's defense(s). The answer must specifically admit or deny each separate allegation in the NOVA; if the respondent is without knowledge, the answer will so state and this will serve as a denial. Failure to deny or controvert a particular allegation will be deemed to be an admission of that allegation. The answer must also set forth any additional or new matter that the respondent contends will support a defense or claim of mitigation. Any defense or partial defense not specifically set forth in the answer shall be deemed to be waived, and evidence supporting that defense or partial defense may be refused, except for good cause shown.
(c)
English required.
The request for hearing, the answer to the NOVA, and all other papers and documentary evidence must be submitted in English.
(d)
Waiver.
The failure of the respondent to file a request for a hearing and an answer within the times prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to appear and contest the allegations set forth in the NOVA. If no hearing is requested and no answer is provided, a final order will be signed by the Secretary of Commerce, or by a designated United States Government official, and will constitute final agency action in the case.
§ 785.5
Representation.
An individual respondent may appear, in person, or be represented by a duly authorized officer or employee. A partner may appear on behalf of a partnership, or a duly authorized officer or employee of a corporation may appear on behalf of the corporation. If a respondent is represented by counsel, counsel shall be a member in good standing of the bar of any State, Commonwealth or Territory of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, or be licensed to practice law in the country in which counsel resides, if not the United States. The U.S. Government will be represented by the Office of Chief Counsel. A respondent personally, or through counsel or other representative who has the power of attorney to represent the respondent, shall file a notice of appearance with the ALJ, or, in cases where settlement negotiations occur before any filing with the ALJ, with the Office of Chief Counsel.
§ 785.6
Filing and service of papers other than the Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA).
(a)
Filing.
All papers to be filed with the ALJ shall be addressed to “Additional Protocol Administrative Enforcement Proceedings,” at the address set forth in the NOVA, or such other place as the ALJ may designate. Filing by United States certified mail, by express or equivalent parcel delivery service, via facsimile, or by hand delivery is acceptable. Filing from a foreign country shall be by airmail, via facsimile, or by express or equivalent parcel delivery service. A copy of each paper filed shall be simultaneously served on all parties.
(b)
Service.
Service shall be made by United States certified mail, by express or equivalent parcel delivery service, via facsimile, or by hand delivery of one copy of each paper to each party in the proceeding. Service on the government party in all proceedings shall be addressed to Office of Chief Counsel for Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Room H-3839, Washington, DC 20230, or sent via facsimile to (202) 482-0085. Service on a respondent shall be to the address to which the NOVA was sent, or to such other address as the respondent may provide. When a party has appeared by counsel or other representative, service on counsel or other representative shall constitute service on that party.
(c)
Date.
The date of filing or service is the day when the papers are deposited in the mail or are delivered in person, by delivery service, or by facsimile. Refusal by the person to be served, or by the person's agent or attorney, of service of a document or other paper will be considered effective service of the document or other paper as of the date of such refusal.
(d)
Certificate of service.
A certificate of service signed by the party making service, stating the date and manner of service, shall accompany every paper, other than the NOVA, filed and served on the parties.
(e)
Computation of time.
In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this part, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period is to be included in the computation unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday (as defined in Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). In such instance, the period runs until the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or allowed is 7 days or less—there is no cap on the period of time to which this exclusion applies, whenever the period of time prescribed or allowed by this part is computed in business days, rather than calendar days.
§ 785.7
Summary decision.
The ALJ may render a summary decision disposing of all or part of a proceeding on the motion of any party to the proceeding, provided that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the party is entitled to summary decision as a matter of law.
§ 785.8
Discovery.
(a)
General.
The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter of the pending proceeding. The provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to discovery apply to the extent consistent with this part and except as otherwise provided by the ALJ or by waiver or agreement of the parties. The ALJ may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. These orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place of discovery, and provisions for protecting the confidentiality of classified or otherwise sensitive information, including Confidential Business Information (CBI) as defined by the Act.
(b)
Interrogatories and requests for admission or production of documents.
A party may serve on any party interrogatories, requests for admission, or requests for production of documents for inspection and copying, and a party may apply to the ALJ for such enforcement or protective order as that party deems warranted with respect to such discovery. The service of a discovery request shall be made at least 30 calendar days before the scheduled date of the hearing unless the ALJ specifies a shorter time period. Copies of interrogatories, requests for admission and requests for production of documents and responses thereto shall be served on all parties and a copy of the certificate of service shall be filed with the ALJ at least 5 business days before the scheduled date of the hearing. Matters of fact or law of which admission is requested shall be deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request (at least 10 business days after service, or within such additional time as the ALJ may allow), the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party to whom the request is directed cannot either admit or deny such matters.
(c)
Depositions.
Upon application of a party and for good cause shown, the ALJ may order the taking of the testimony of any person by deposition and the production of specified documents or materials by the person at the deposition. The application shall state the purpose of the deposition and set forth the facts sought to be established through the deposition.
(d)
Enforcement.
The ALJ may order a party to answer designated questions, to produce specified documents or things or to take any other action in response to a proper discovery request. If a party does not comply with such an order, the ALJ may make a determination or enter any order in the proceeding as the ALJ deems reasonable and appropriate. The ALJ may strike related charges or defenses in whole or
in part or may take particular facts relating to the discovery request to which the party failed or refused to respond as being established for purposes of the proceeding in accordance with the contentions of the party seeking discovery. In addition, enforcement by any district court of the United States in which venue is proper may be sought as appropriate.
§ 785.9
Subpoenas.
(a)
Issuance.
Upon the application of any party, supported by a satisfactory showing that there is substantial reason to believe that the evidence would not otherwise be available, the ALJ may issue subpoenas to any person requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of such books, records or other documentary or physical evidence for the purpose of the hearing, as the ALJ deems relevant and material to the proceedings, and reasonable in scope. Witnesses shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of contempt, challenge or refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any person pursuant to this paragraph, any district court of the United States, in which venue is proper, has jurisdiction to issue an order requiring any such person to comply with a subpoena. Any failure to obey an order of the court is punishable by the court as a contempt thereof.
(b)
Service.
Subpoenas issued by the ALJ may be served by any of the methods set forth in § 785.6(b) of the APR.
(c)
Timing.
Applications for subpoenas must be submitted at least 10 business days before the scheduled hearing or deposition, unless the ALJ determines, for good cause shown, that extraordinary circumstances warrant a shorter time.
§ 785.10
Matters protected against disclosure.
(a)
Protective measures.
The ALJ may limit discovery or introduction of evidence or issue such protective or other orders as in the ALJ's judgment may be needed to prevent undue disclosure of classified or sensitive documents or information. Where the ALJ determines that documents containing classified or sensitive matter must be made available to a party in order to avoid prejudice, the ALJ may direct the other party to prepare an unclassified and nonsensitive summary or extract of the documents. The ALJ may compare the extract or summary with the original to ensure that it is supported by the source document and that it omits only so much as must remain undisclosed. The summary or extract may be admitted as evidence in the record.
(b)
Arrangements for access.
If the ALJ determines that the summary procedure outlined in paragraph (a) of this section is unsatisfactory, and that classified or otherwise sensitive matter must form part of the record in order to avoid prejudice to a party, the ALJ may provide the parties with the opportunity to make arrangements that permit a party or a representative to have access to such matter without compromising sensitive information. Such arrangements may include obtaining security clearances or giving counsel for a party access to sensitive information and documents subject to assurances against further disclosure, including a protective order, if necessary.
§ 785.11
Prehearing conference.
(a) On the ALJ's own motion, or on request of a party, the ALJ may direct the parties to participate in a prehearing conference, either in person or by telephone, to consider:
(1) Simplification of issues;
(2) The necessity or desirability of amendments to pleadings;
(3) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid unnecessary proof; or
(4) Such other matters as may expedite the disposition of the proceedings.
(b) The ALJ may order the conference proceedings to be recorded electronically or taken by a reporter, transcribed and filed with the ALJ.
(c) If a prehearing conference is impracticable, the ALJ may direct the parties to correspond with the ALJ to achieve the purposes of such a conference.
(d) The ALJ will prepare a summary of any actions agreed on or taken pursuant to this section. The summary
will include any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties.
§ 785.12
Hearings.
(a)
Scheduling.
Upon receipt of a valid request for a hearing, the ALJ shall, by agreement with all the parties or upon notice to all parties of at least 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of a request for a hearing, schedule a hearing. All hearings will be held in Washington, DC, unless the ALJ determines, for good cause shown, that another location would better serve the interest of justice.
(b)
Hearing procedure.
Hearings will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner by the ALJ. All hearings will be closed, unless the ALJ for good cause shown determines otherwise. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law do not apply, and all evidentiary material deemed by the ALJ to be relevant and material to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious will be received and given appropriate weight, except that any evidence of settlement which would be excluded under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is not admissible. Witnesses will testify under oath or affirmation, and shall be subject to cross-examination.
(c)
Testimony and record.
(1) A verbatim record of the hearing and of any other oral proceedings will be taken by reporter or by electronic recording, and filed with the ALJ. If any party wishes to obtain a written copy of the transcript, that party shall pay the costs of transcription. The parties may share the costs if both want a transcript.
(2) Upon such terms as the ALJ deems just, the ALJ may direct that the testimony of any person be taken by deposition and may admit an affidavit or report as evidence, provided that any affidavits or reports have been filed and served on the parties sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit a party to file and serve an objection thereto on the grounds that it is necessary that the affiant or declarant testify at the hearing and be subject to cross-examination.
(d)
Failure to appear.
If a party fails to appear in person or by counsel at a scheduled hearing, the hearing may nevertheless proceed. The party's failure to appear will not affect the validity of the hearing or any proceeding or action taken thereafter.
§ 785.13
Procedural stipulations.
Unless otherwise ordered and subject to § 785.14 of the APR, a written stipulation agreed to by all parties and filed with the ALJ will modify the procedures established by this part.
§ 785.14
Extension of time.
The parties may extend any applicable time limitation by stipulation filed with the ALJ before the time limitation expires, or the ALJ may, on the ALJ's own initiative or upon application by any party, either before or after the expiration of any applicable time limitation, extend the time, except that the requirement that a hearing be demanded within 15 calendar days, and the requirement that a final agency decision be made within 60 calendar days, may not be modified.
§ 785.15
Post-hearing submissions.
All parties shall have the opportunity to file post-hearing submissions that may include findings of fact and conclusions of law, supporting evidence and legal arguments, exceptions to the ALJ's rulings or to the admissibility of evidence, and orders and settlements.
§ 785.16
Decisions.
(a)
Recommended decision and order.
After considering the entire record in the case, the ALJ will issue a recommended decision based on a preponderance of the evidence. The decision will include findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a decision based thereon as to whether the respondent has violated the Act. If the ALJ finds that the evidence of record is insufficient to sustain a finding that a violation has occurred with respect to one or more allegations, the ALJ shall order dismissal of the allegation(s) in whole or in part, as appropriate. If the ALJ finds that one or more violations have been committed, the ALJ shall issue an order imposing administrative sanctions.
(b)
Factors considered in assessing penalties.
In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the ALJ shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation(s),
and, with respect to the respondent, the respondent's ability to pay the penalty, the effect of a civil penalty on the respondent's ability to continue to do business, the respondent's history of prior violations, and such other matters as justice may require.
(c)
Referral of recommended decision and order.
The ALJ shall immediately issue and serve the recommended decision (and order, if appropriate) to the Office of Chief Counsel, at the address in § 785.6(b) of the APR, and to the respondent, by courier delivery or overnight mail. The recommended decision and order will also be referred to the head of the designated executive agency for final decision and order.
(d)
Final decision and order.
The recommended decision and order shall become the final agency decision and order unless, within 60 calendar days, the Secretary of Commerce, or a designated United States Government official, modifies or vacates it, or unless an appeal has been filed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
(e)
Appeals.
The respondent may appeal the final agency decision within 30 calendar days after the date of certification. Petitions for appeal may be filed in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the Court of Appeals for the district in which the violation occurred.
§ 785.17
Settlement.
(a)
Settlements before issuance of a NOVA.
When the parties have agreed to a settlement of the case prior to issuance of a NOVA, a settlement proposal consisting of a settlement agreement and order will be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement for approval and signature. If the Assistant Secretary does not approve the proposal, he/she will notify the parties and the case will proceed as though no settlement proposal has been made. If the Assistant Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an appropriate order, and no action will be required by the ALJ.
(b)
Settlements following issuance of a NOVA.
The parties may enter into settlement negotiations at any time during the time a case is pending before the ALJ. If necessary, the parties may extend applicable time limitations or otherwise request that the ALJ stay the proceedings while settlement negotiations continue. When the parties have agreed to a settlement of the case, the Office of Chief Counsel will recommend the settlement to the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement, forwarding a proposed settlement agreement and order, which the Assistant Secretary will approve and sign. If a NOVA has been filed, the Office of Chief Counsel will send a copy of the settlement proposal to the ALJ.
(c)
Settlement scope.
Any respondent who agrees to an order imposing any administrative sanction does so solely for the purpose of resolving the claims in the administrative enforcement proceeding brought under this Part. The government officials involved have neither the authority nor the responsibility for initiating, conducting, settling, or otherwise disposing of criminal proceedings. That authority and responsibility are vested in the Attorney General and the Department of Justice.
(d)
Finality.
Cases that are settled may not be reopened or appealed, absent a showing of good cause. Appeals and requests to reopen settled cases must be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement within 30 calendar days of the execution of a settlement agreement.
§ 785.18
Record for decision.
(a)
The record.
The transcript of hearings, exhibits, rulings, orders, all papers and requests filed in the proceedings, and, for purposes of any appeal under § 785.16 of the APR, the decision of the ALJ and such submissions as are provided for under § 785.16 of the APR will constitute the record and the exclusive basis for decision. When a case is settled, the record will consist of any and all of the foregoing, as well as the NOVA or draft NOVA, settlement agreement, and order.
(b)
Restricted access.
On the ALJ's own motion, or on the motion of any party, the ALJ may direct that there be a restricted access portion of the record for any material in the record to which public access is restricted by law or by the terms of a protective order entered in the proceedings. A party seeking to restrict access to any portion of the record is responsible, prior
to the close of the proceeding, for submitting a version of the document(s) proposed for public availability that reflects the requested deletion. The restricted access portion of the record will be placed in a separate file and the file will be clearly marked to avoid improper disclosure and to identify it as a portion of the official record in the proceedings. The ALJ may act at any time to permit material that becomes declassified or unrestricted through passage of time to be transferred to the unrestricted access portion of the record.
(c)
Availability of documents
—(1)
Scope.
All NOVAs and draft NOVAs, answers, settlement agreements, decisions and orders disposing of a case will be displayed on the BIS Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Web site, at
http://www.bis.doc.gov/foia,
which is maintained by the Office of Administration, Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce. The Office of Administration does not maintain a separate inspection facility. The complete record for decision, as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be made available on request.
(2)
Timing.
The record for decision will be available only after the final administrative disposition of a case. Parties may seek to restrict access to any portion of the record under paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 785.19
Payment of final assessment.
(a)
Time for payment.
Full payment of the civil penalty must be made within 30 days of the effective date of the order or within such longer period of time as may be specified in the order. Payment shall be made in the manner specified in the NOVA.
(b)
Enforcement of order.
The government party may, through the Attorney General, file suit in an appropriate district court if necessary to enforce compliance with a final order issued under the APR. This suit will include a claim for interest at current prevailing rates from the date of expiration of the 60-day period referred to in § 785.16(d), or the date of the final order, as appropriate.
(c)
Offsets.
The amount of any civil penalty imposed by a final order may be deducted from any sum(s) owed by the United States to a respondent.
§ 785.20
Reporting a violation.
If a person learns that a violation of the Additional Protocol, the Act, or the APR has occurred or may occur, that person may notify: Office of Export Enforcement, Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Room H-4520, Washington, DC 20230; Tel: (202) 482-1208; Facsimile: (202) 482-0964.

§ 786.1
Inspection of records.
Upon request by BIS, you must permit access to and copying of any record relating to compliance with the requirements of the APR. This requires that you make available the equipment and, if necessary, knowledgeable personnel for locating, reading, and reproducing any record. Copies may be necessary to facilitate IAEA Team review of documents during complementary access. The IAEA Team may not remove these documents from the location without BIS authorization (see § 784.3(j)(2) of the APR).
§ 786.2
Recordkeeping.
(a)
Requirements.
Each person and location required to submit a report or correspondence under parts 782 through 784 of the APR must retain all supporting materials and documentation used to prepare such report or correspondence.
(b)
Three year retention period.
All supporting materials and documentation required to be kept under paragraph (a) of this section must be retained for three years from the due
date of the applicable report or for three years from the date of submission of the applicable report, whichever is later. Due dates for reports and correspondence are indicated in parts 782 through 784 of the APR.
(c)
Location of records.
Records retained under this section must be maintained at the location or must be accessible at the location for purposes of complementary access at the location by IAEA Teams.
(d)
Reproduction of original records.
(1) You may maintain reproductions instead of the original records, provided all of the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are met.
(2) If you must maintain records under this part, you may use any photostatic, miniature photographic, micrographic, automated archival storage, or other process that completely, accurately, legibly and durably reproduces the original records (whether on paper, microfilm, or through electronic digital storage techniques). The process must meet all of the following requirements, which are applicable to all systems:
(i) The system must be capable of reproducing all records on paper.
(ii) The system must record and be able to reproduce all marks, information, and other characteristics of the original record, including both obverse and reverse sides (unless blank) of paper documents in legible form.
(iii) When displayed on a viewer, monitor, or reproduced on paper, the records must exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability. For purposes of this section, legible and legibility mean the quality of a letter or numeral that enable the observer to identify it positively and quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. Readable and readability mean the quality of a group of letters or numerals being recognized as complete words or numbers.
(iv) The system must preserve the initial image (including both obverse and reverse sides, unless blank, of paper documents) and record all changes, who made them and when they were made. This information must be stored in such a manner that none of it may be altered once it is initially recorded.
(v) You must establish written procedures to identify the individuals who are responsible for the operation, use and maintenance of the system.
(vi) You must keep a record of where, when, by whom, and on what equipment the records and other information were entered into the system.
(3)
Requirements applicable to a system based on digital images.
For systems based on the storage of digital images, the system must provide accessibility to any digital image in the system. The system must be able to locate and reproduce all records according to the same criteria that would have been used to organize the records had they been maintained in original form.
(4)
Requirements applicable to a system based on photographic processes.
For systems based on photographic, photostatic, or miniature photographic processes, the records must be maintained according to an index of all records in the system following the same criteria that would have been used to organize the records had they been maintained in original form.
§ 786.3
Destruction or disposal of records.
If BIS or any other authorized U.S. government agency makes a formal or informal request for a certain record or records, such record or records may not be destroyed or disposed of without the written authorization of the requesting entity.

§ 791.1
Purpose.
Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 96892, Dec. 6, 2024.
(a) This part sets forth the procedures by which the Secretary may:
(1) Determine whether any acquisition, importation, transfer, installation, dealing in, or use of any information and communications technology or service, including but not limited to connected software applications, (ICTS Transaction) that has been designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of foreign adversaries poses certain undue or unacceptable risks as identified in the Executive Order. For purposes of these regulations, the Secretary will consider ICTS to be designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by a person owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary where such a person operates, manages, maintains, or services the ICTS;
(2) Issue a determination to prohibit an ICTS Transaction;
(3) Direct the timing and manner of the cessation of the ICTS Transaction;
(4) Consider factors that may mitigate the risks posed by the ICTS Transaction.
(b) The Secretary will evaluate ICTS Transactions under this rule, which include, but are not limited to, classes of transactions, on a case-by-case basis. The Secretary, in consultation with appropriate agency heads specified in Executive Order 13873 and other relevant governmental bodies, as appropriate, shall make an initial determination as to whether to prohibit a given ICTS Transaction or propose mitigation measures, by which the ICTS Transaction may be permitted. Parties may submit information in response to the initial determination, including a response to the initial determination and any supporting materials and/or proposed measures to remediate or mitigate the risks identified in the initial determination as posed by the ICTS Transaction at issue. Upon consideration of the parties' submissions, the Secretary will issue a final determination prohibiting the transaction, not prohibiting the transaction, or permitting the transaction subject to the
adoption of measures determined by the Secretary to sufficiently mitigate the risks associated with the ICTS Transaction. The Secretary shall also engage in coordination and information sharing, as appropriate, with international partners on the application of this part.
[88 FR 39357, June 16, 2023]
