Characterization of stock of controlled foreign corporations
—(i)
Operative sections
—(A)
Operative sections other than section 904.
For purposes of applying this section to an operative section other than section 904, stock in a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957) is characterized as an asset in the relevant groupings on the basis of the asset method described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, or the modified gross income method described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. Stock in a controlled foreign corporation whose interest expense is
apportioned on the basis of assets is characterized in the hands of its United States shareholders under the asset method described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. Stock in a controlled foreign corporation whose interest expense is apportioned on the basis of modified gross income is characterized in the hands of its United States shareholders under the modified gross income method described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.
(B)
Section 904 as operative section.
For purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, § 1.861-13 applies to characterize the stock of a controlled foreign corporation as an asset producing foreign source income in the separate categories described in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v), or as an asset producing U.S. source income in the residual grouping, in the hands of the United States shareholder, and to determine the portion of the stock that gives rise to an inclusion under section 951A(a) that is treated as an exempt asset under § 1.861-8(d)(2)(ii)(C). Section 1.861-13 also provides rules for subdividing the stock in the various separate categories and the residual grouping into a section 245A subgroup and a non-section 245A subgroup in order to determine the amount of the adjustments required by section 904(b)(4) and § 1.904(b)-3(c) with respect to the section 245A subgroup, and provides rules for determining the portion of the stock that gives rise to a dividend eligible for a deduction under section 245(a)(5) that is treated as an exempt asset under § 1.861-8(d)(2)(ii)(B).
(ii)
Asset method.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-12T(c)(3)(ii).
(iii)
Modified gross income method.
Under the modified gross income method, the taxpayer characterizes the tax book value of the stock of the first-tier controlled foreign corporation based on the gross income, net of interest expense, of the controlled foreign corporation (as computed under § 1.861-9T(j) to include certain gross income, net of interest expense, of lower-tier controlled foreign corporations) within each relevant category for the taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation ending with or within the taxable year of the taxpayer. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii), however, the gross income, net of interest expense, of the first-tier controlled foreign corporation includes the total amount of gross subpart F income, net of interest expense, of any lower-tier controlled foreign corporation that was excluded under the rules of § 1.861-9(j)(2)(ii)(B).
(4)
Characterization of stock of noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations
—(i)
In general.
Except in the case of a nonqualifying shareholder described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the principles of § 1.861-12(c)(3), including the relevant rules of § 1.861-13 when section 904 is the operative section, apply to characterize stock in a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(E)). Accordingly, stock in a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation is characterized as an asset in the various separate categories on the basis of either the asset method described in § 1.861-12T(c)(3)(ii) or the modified gross income method described in § 1.861-12(c)(3)(iii). Stock in a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation the interest expense of which is apportioned on the basis of assets is characterized in the hands of its shareholders under the asset method described in § 1.861-12T(c)(3)(ii). Stock in a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation the interest expense of which is apportioned on the basis of gross income is characterized in the hands of its shareholders under the modified gross income method described in § 1.861-12(c)(3)(iii).
(ii)
Nonqualifying shareholders.
Stock in a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation is characterized as a passive category asset in the hands of a shareholder that either is not a domestic corporation or is not a United States shareholder with respect to the noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation for the taxable year. Stock in a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation is characterized as in the separate category described in section 904(d)(4)(C)(ii) in the hands of any shareholder with respect to whom look-through treatment is not substantiated.
See also
§ 1.904-5(c)(4)(iii)(B). In the case of a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation that is a passive foreign investment company
with respect to a shareholder, stock in the noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation is characterized as a passive category asset in the hands of the shareholder if such shareholder does not meet the ownership requirements described in section 904(d)(2)(E)(i)(II).
(d)
Treatment of notes
—(1)
General rule.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-12T(d)(1).
(2)
Characterization of related controlled foreign corporation notes.
The debt of a controlled foreign corporation is characterized in the same manner as the interest income derived from that debt obligation. See §§ 1.904-4 and 1.904-5(c)(2) for rules treating interest income as income in a separate category.
(e)
Portfolio securities that constitute inventory or generate primarily gains.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-12T(e).
(f)
Assets connected with capitalized, deferred, or disallowed interest
—(1)
In general.
In the case of any asset in connection with which interest expense accruing during a taxable year is capitalized, deferred, or disallowed under any provision of the Code, the value of the asset for allocation and apportionment purposes is reduced by the principal amount of indebtedness the interest on which is so capitalized, deferred, or disallowed. Assets are connected with debt (the interest on which is capitalized, deferred, or disallowed) only if using the debt proceeds to acquire or produce the asset causes the interest to be capitalized, deferred, or disallowed.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(i)
Example 1: Capitalized interest under section 263A
—(A)
Facts.
X is a domestic corporation that uses the tax book value method of apportionment. X has $1,000x of indebtedness and incurs $100x of interest expense. Using $800x of the $1,000x debt proceeds to produce tangible property, X capitalizes $80x of interest expense under the rules of section 263A. X deducts the remaining $20x of interest expense.
(B)
Analysis.
Because interest on $800x of debt is capitalized under section 263A by reason of the use of debt proceeds to produce the tangible property, $800x of the principal amount of X's debt is connected to the tangible property under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Therefore, for purposes of apportioning the remaining $20x of X's interest expense, the adjusted basis of the tangible property is reduced by $800x.
(ii)
Example 2: Disallowed interest under section 163(l)
—(A)
Facts.
X, a domestic corporation, owns 100% of the stock of Y, a domestic corporation. X and Y file a consolidated return and use the tax book value method of apportionment. In Year 1, X makes a loan of $1,000x to Y (Loan A) and Y then uses the Loan A proceeds to acquire in a cash purchase all the stock of a foreign corporation, Z. Interest on Loan A is payable in U.S. dollars or, at the option of Y, in stock of Z.
(B)
Analysis.
Under section 163(l), Loan A is a disqualified debt instrument because interest on Loan A is payable at the option of Y in stock of a related party to Y. Because Loan A is a disqualified debt instrument, section 163(l)(1) disallows Y's interest deduction for interest payable on Loan A. However, the value of the Z stock is not reduced under paragraph (f)(1) of this section because the use of the Loan A proceeds to acquire the stock of Z is not the cause of Y's interest deduction being disallowed. Rather, the Loan A terms allowing interest to be paid in stock of Z is the cause of Y's interest deduction being disallowed under section 163(l). Therefore, no adjustment is made to Y's adjusted basis in the stock of Z for purposes of allocating the interest expense of X and Y.

§ 1.861-12T
Characterization rules and adjustments for certain assets (temporary).
(a)
In general.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-12(a).
(b)
Inventories.
Inventory must be characterized by reference to the source and character of sales income, or sales receipts in the case of LIFO inventory, from that inventory during the taxable year. If a taxpayer maintains separate inventories for any federal tax purpose, including the rules for establishing pools of inventory items under sections 472 and 474 of the Code, each separate inventory shall be separately characterized in accordance with the previous sentence.
(c)
Treatment of stock
—(1)
In general.
Subject to the adjustment and special rules of paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, stock in a corporation is taken into account in the application of the asset method described in § 1.861-9T(g). However, an affiliated group (as defined in § 1.861-11T(d)) does not take into account the stock of any member in the application of the asset method.

Basis adjustment for stock in nonaffiliated 10 percent owned corporations
—
(i)(A)-(C) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.861-12(c)(2)(i)(A) through (c)(2)(i)(C).
(ii)
10 percent owned corporation defined
—(A)
In general.
The term “10 percent owned corporation” means any corporation (domestic or foreign)—
(
1
) Which is not included within the taxpayer's affiliated group as defined in § 1.861-11T(d) (1) or (6).
(
2
) In which the members of the taxpayer's affiliated group own directly or indirectly 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of the stock entitled to vote, and
(
3
) Which is taken into account for purposes of apportionment.
(B)
Rule of attribution.
Stock that is owned by a corporation, partnership, or trust shall be treated as being indirectly owned proportionately by its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries. For this purpose, a partner's interest in stock held by a partnership shall be determined by reference to the partner's distributive share of partnership income.
(iii)
Earnings and profits of lower-tier corporations taken into account.
For purposes of the adjustment to the basis of the stock of the 10 percent owned corporation owned by the taxpayer under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the earnings and profits of that corporation shall include its pro rata share of the earnings and profits (or any deficit therein) of each succeeding lower-tier 10 percent owned corporation. Thus, a first-tier 10 percent owned corporation shall combine with its own earnings and profits its pro rata share of the earnings and profits of all such lower-tier corporations. The affiliated group shall then adjust its basis in the stock of the first-tier corporation by its pro rata share of the total combined earnings and profits of the first-tier and the lower-tier corporations. In the case of a 10 percent owned corporation whose tax year does not conform to that of the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall include the annual earnings and profits of such 10 percent owned corporation for the tax year ending within the tax year of the taxpayer, whether or not such 10 percent owned corporation is owned directly by the taxpayer.
(iv)
Special rules for foreign corporations in pre-effective date tax years.
Solely for purposes of determining the adjustment required under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, for tax years beginning after 1912 and before 1987, financial earnings (or losses) of a foreign corporation computed using United States generally accepted accounting principles may be substituted for earnings and profits in making the adjustment required by paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. A taxpayer is not required to isolate the financial earnings of a foreign corporation derived or incurred during its period of 10 percent ownership or during the post-1912 taxable years and determine earnings and profits (or deficits) attributable under section 1248 principles to the taxpayer's stock in a 10 percent owned corporation. Instead, the taxpayer may include
all historic financial earnings for purposes of this adjustment. If the affiliated group elects to use financial earnings with respect to any foreign corporation, financial earnings must be used by that group with respect to all foreign corporations, except that earnings and profits may in any event be used for controlled foreign corporations for taxable years beginning after 1962 and before 1987. However, if the affiliated group elects to use earnings and profits with respect to any single controlled foreign corporation for the 1963 through 1986 period, such election shall apply with respect to all its controlled foreign corporations.
(v)
Taxpayers using the fair market value method.
Because the fair market value of any asset which is stock will reflect retained earnings and profits, taxpayers who use the fair market value method shall not adjust stock basis by the amount of retained earnings and profits, as otherwise required by paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Characterization of stock of controlled foreign corporations
—(i)
Operative sections.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-12(c)(3)(i).
(ii)
Asset method.
Under the asset method, the taxpayer characterizes the tax book value or fair market value of the stock of a controlled foreign corporation based on an analysis of the assets owned by the controlled foreign corporation during the foreign corporation's taxable year that ends with or within the taxpayer's taxable year. This process is based on the application of § 1.861-9T(g) at the level of the controlled foreign corporation. In the case of a controlled foreign corporation that owns stock in one or more lower-tier controlled foreign corporations in which the United States taxpayer is a United States shareholder, the characterization of the tax book value of the fair market value of the stock of the first-tier controlled foreign corporation to the various separate limitation categories of the affiliated group must take into account the stock in lower-tier corporations. For this purpose, the stock of each such lower-tier corporation shall be characterized by reference to the assets owned during the lower-tier corporation's taxable year that ends during the taxpayer's taxable year. The analysis of assets within a chain of controlled foreign corporations must begin at the lowest-tier controlled foreign corporation and proceed up the chain to the first-tier controlled foreign corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the value of any passive asset to which related person interest is allocated under § 1.904-5(c)(2)(ii) must be reduced by the principal amount of indebtedness on which such interest is incurred. Furthermore, the value of any asset to which interest expense is directly allocated under § 1.861-10T must be reduced as provided in § 1.861-9T(g)(2)(iii). See § 1.861-9T(h)(5) for further guidance concerning characterization of stock in a related person under the fair market value method.
(iii)
Modified gross income method.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-12(c)(3)(iii).
(4) [Reserved] For further guidance,
see
§ 1.861-12(c)(4).
(d)
Treatment of notes
—(1)
General rule.
Subject to the adjustments and special rules of this paragraph (d) and paragraph (e) of this section, all notes held by a taxpayer are taken into account in the application of the asset method described in § 1.861-9T(g). However, the notes of an affiliated corporation are subject to special rules set forth in § 1.861-11T(e). For purposes of this section, the term “notes” means all interest bearing debt, including debt bearing original issue discount.
(2)
Characterization of related controlled foreign corporation notes.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-12(d)(2).
(e)
Portfolio securities that constitute inventory or generate primarily gains.
Because gain on the sale of securities is sourced by reference to the residence of the seller, a resident of the United States will generally receive domestic source income (and a foreign resident will generally receive foreign source income) upon sale or disposition of securities that otherwise generate foreign source dividends and interest (or domestic source dividends and interest in the case of a foreign resident). Although under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section securities are characterized by reference to the source and character of dividends and interest, the source and character of income on gain or disposition must also be taken into
account for purposes of characterizing portfolio securities if:
(1) The securities constitute inventory in the hands of the holder, or
(2) 80 percent or more of the gross income generated by a taxpayer's entire portfolio of such securities during a taxable year consists of gains.
For this purpose, a portfolio security is a security in any entity other than a controlled foreign corporation with respect to which the taxpayer is a United States shareholder under section 957, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation with respect to the taxpayer, or a 10 percent owned corporation as defined in § 1.861-12(c)(2)(ii). In taking gains into account, a taxpayer must treat all portfolio securities generating foreign source dividends and interest as a single asset and all portfolio securities generating domestic source dividends as a single asset and shall characterize the total value of that asset based on the source of all income and gain generated by those securities in the taxable year.
(f)
Assets connected with capitalized, deferred, or disallowed interest.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-12(f).
(g)
Special rules for FSCs
—(1)
Treatment of FSC stock.
No interest expense shall be allocated or apportioned to stock of a foreign sales corporation (“FSC”) to the extent that the FSC stock is attributable to the separate limitation for certain FSC distributions described in section 904(d)(1)(H). FSC stock is considered to be attributable solely to the separate limitation category described in section 904(d)(1)(H) unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that more than 20 percent of the FSC's gross income for the taxable year consists of income other than foreign trading income.
(2)
Treatment of assets that generate foreign trade income.
Assets of the related supplier that generate foreign trade income must be prorated between assets attributable to foreign source general limitation income and assets attributable to domestic source income in proportion to foreign source general limitation income and domestic source income derived from transactions generating foreign trade income.
(i)
Value of assets attributable to foreign source income.
The value of assets attributable to foreign source general limitation income is computed by multiplying the value of assets for the taxable year generating foreign trading gross receipts by a fraction:
(A) The numerator of which is foreign source general limitation income for the taxable year derived from transactions giving rise to foreign trading gross receipts, after the application of the limitation provided in section 927(e)(1), and
(B) The denominator of which is total income for the taxable year derived from the transaction giving rise to foreign trading gross receipts.
(ii)
Value of assets attributable to domestic source income.
The value of assets attributable to domestic source income is computed by subtracting from the total value of assets for the taxable year generating foreign trading gross receipts the value of assets attributable to foreign source general limitation income as computed under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
(h)
Special rules for DISCs
—(1)
Treatment of DISC stock.
No interest shall be allocated or apportioned to stock in a DISC (or stock in a former DISC to the extent that the stock in the former DISC is attributable to the separate limitation category described in section 904(d)(1)(F)).
(2)
Treatment of assets that generate qualified export receipts.
Assets of the related supplier that generate qualified export receipts must be prorated between assets attributable to foreign source general limitation income and assets attributable to domestic source income in proportion to foreign source general limitation income and domestic source income derived from transactions during the taxable year from transactions generating qualified export receipts.
(i)-(j) [Reserved]
(k)
Effective/applicability date.
The rules of this section apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.
[T.D. 8228, 53 FR 35495, Sept. 14, 1988, as amended by T.D. 9260, 71 FR 24526, Apr. 25, 2006, T.D. 9452, 74 FR 27875, June 11, 2009; T.D. 9456, 74 FR 38875, Aug. 4, 2009; T.D. 9866, 84 FR 29336, June 21, 2019; T.D. 9882, 84 FR 69070, Dec. 17, 2019; T.D. 9922, 85 FR 72041, Nov. 12, 2020]
§ 1.861-13
Special rules for characterization of controlled foreign corporation stock.
(a)
Methodology.
For purposes of allocating and apportioning deductions for purposes of section 904 as the operative section, stock in a controlled foreign corporation owned directly or indirectly through a partnership or other pass-through entity by a United States shareholder is characterized by the United States shareholder under the rules described in this section. In general, paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section characterize the stock of the controlled foreign corporation as an asset in the various statutory groupings and residual grouping based on the type of income that the stock of the controlled foreign corporation generates, has generated, or may reasonably be expected to generate when the income is included by the United States shareholder.
(1)
Step 1: Characterize stock as generating income in statutory groupings under the asset or modified gross income method
—(i)
Asset method.
A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation that apportions its interest expense on the basis of assets must characterize stock of the controlled foreign corporation using the asset method described in § 1.861-12T(c)(3)(ii) to assign the assets of the controlled foreign corporation to the statutory groupings described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A)(
1
) through (
10
) and (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section. If the controlled foreign corporation owns stock in a lower-tier noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation, the assets of the lower-tier noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation are assigned to a gross subpart F income grouping to the extent such assets generate income that, if distributed to the controlled foreign corporation, would be gross subpart F income of the controlled foreign corporation.
See also
§ 1.861-12(c)(4).
(A)
General and passive categories.
Within each of the controlled foreign corporation's general category and passive category, each of the following subgroups within each category is a separate statutory grouping—
(
1
) Foreign source gross tested income;
(
2
) For each applicable treaty, U.S. source gross tested income that, when taken into account by a United States shareholder under section 951A, is resourced in the hands of the United States shareholder (
resourced gross tested income
);
(
3
) U.S. source gross tested income not described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section;
(
4
) Foreign source gross subpart F income;
(
5
) For each applicable treaty, U.S. source gross subpart F income that, when included by a United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1), is resourced in the hands of the United States shareholder (
resourced gross subpart F income
);
(
6
) U.S. source gross subpart F income not described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A)(
5
) of this section;
(
7
) Foreign source gross section 245(a)(5) income;
(
8
) U.S. source gross section 245(a)(5) income;
(
9
) Any other foreign source gross income (
specified foreign source general category gross income
or
specified foreign source passive category gross income,
as the case may be); and
(
10
) Any other U.S. source gross income (
specified U.S. source general category gross income
or
specified U.S. source passive category gross income,
as the case may be).
(B)
Section 901(j) income.
For each country described in section 901(j), all gross income from sources in that country.
(ii)
Modified gross income method.
A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation that apportions its interest expense on the basis of modified gross income must characterize stock of the controlled foreign corporation using the modified gross income method under § 1.861-12(c)(3)(iii) to assign the modified gross income of the controlled foreign corporation to the statutory groupings described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A)(
1
) through (
10
) and (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(ii), the rules described in §§ 1.861-12(c)(3)(iii) and 1.861-9T(j)(2) apply to combine gross income in a statutory grouping that is earned by the controlled foreign corporation with gross income of
lower-tier controlled foreign corporations that is in the same statutory grouping. For example, foreign source general category gross tested income (net of interest expense) earned by the controlled foreign corporation is combined with its pro rata share of the foreign source general category gross tested income (net of interest expense) of lower-tier controlled foreign corporations. If the controlled foreign corporation owns stock in a lower-tier noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation, gross income of the lower-tier noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporation is assigned to a gross subpart F income grouping to the extent that the income, if distributed to the upper-tier controlled foreign corporation, would be gross subpart F income of the upper-tier controlled foreign corporation.
See also
§ 1.861-12(c)(4).
(2)
Step 2: Assign stock to the section 951A category.
A controlled foreign corporation is not treated as earning section 951A category income. The portion of the value of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the section 951A category (as defined in § 1.904-4(g)) equals the value of the portion of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the foreign source gross tested income statutory groupings within the general category (
general category gross tested income stock
) multiplied by the United States shareholder's inclusion percentage. Under § 1.861-8(d)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
)(
ii
), a portion of the value of stock assigned to the section 951A category may be treated as an exempt asset. The portion of the general category gross tested income stock that is not characterized as a section 951A category asset remains a general category asset and may result in expenses being disregarded under section 904(b)(4).
See
paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section and § 1.904(b)-3. No portion of the passive category gross tested income stock or U.S. source gross tested income stock is assigned to the section 951A category.
(3)
Step 3: Assign stock to a treaty category
—(i)
Inclusions under section 951A(a).
The portion of the value of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to a particular treaty category due to an inclusion of U.S. source income under section 951A(a) that was resourced under a particular treaty equals the value of the portion of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the resourced gross tested income statutory grouping within each of the controlled foreign corporation's general or passive categories (
resourced gross tested income stock
) multiplied by the United States shareholder's inclusion percentage. Under § 1.861-8(d)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
)(
ii
), a portion of the value of stock assigned to a particular treaty category by reason of this paragraph (a)(3)(i) may be treated as an exempt asset. The portion of the resourced gross tested income stock that is not characterized as a treaty category asset remains a U.S. source general or passive category asset, as the case may be, that is in the residual grouping and may result in expenses being disregarded under section 904(b)(4) for purposes of determining entire taxable income under section 904(a).
See
paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section and § 1.904(b)-3.
(ii)
Inclusions under section 951(a)(1).
The portion of the value of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to a particular treaty category due to an inclusion of U.S. source income under section 951(a)(1) that was resourced under a treaty equals the value of the portion of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the resourced gross subpart F income statutory grouping within each of the controlled foreign corporation's general category or passive category.
(4)
Step 4: Aggregate stock within each separate category and assign stock to the residual grouping.
The portions of the value of stock of the controlled foreign corporation assigned to foreign source statutory groupings that were not specifically assigned to the section 951A category under paragraph (a)(2) of this section (Step 2) are aggregated within the general category and the passive category to characterize the stock as general category stock and passive category stock, respectively. The portions of the value of stock of the controlled foreign corporation assigned to U.S. source statutory groupings that were
not specifically assigned to a particular treaty category under paragraph (a)(3) of this section (Step 3) are aggregated to characterize the stock as U.S. source category stock, which is in the residual grouping. Stock assigned to the separate category for income described in section 901(j)(1) remains in that category.
(5)
Step 5: Determine section 245A and non-section 245A subgroups for each separate category and U.S. source category
—(i)
In general.
In the case of stock of a controlled foreign corporation that is held directly or indirectly through a partnership or other pass-through entity by a United States shareholder that is a domestic corporation, stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is general category stock, passive category stock, and U.S. source category stock is subdivided between a section 245A subgroup and a non-section 245A subgroup under paragraphs (a)(5)(ii) through (v) of this section for purposes of applying section 904(b)(4) and § 1.904(b)-3(c). Each subgroup is treated as a statutory grouping under § 1.861-8(a)(4) for purposes of allocating and apportioning deductions under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and 1.861-17 in applying section 904 as the operative section. Deductions apportioned to each section 245A subgroup are disregarded under section 904(b)(4).
See
§ 1.904(b)-3. Deductions apportioned to the statutory groupings for gross section 245(a)(5) income are not disregarded under section 904(b)(4); however, a portion of the stock assigned to those groupings is treated as exempt under § 1.861-8T(d)(2)(ii)(B).
(ii)
Section 245A subgroup of general category stock.
The portion of the general category stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the section 245A subgroup of the general category equals the value of the general category gross tested income stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is not assigned to the section 951A category under paragraph (a)(2) of this section (Step 2), plus the value of the portion of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the specified foreign source general category gross income statutory grouping.
(iii)
Section 245A subgroup of passive category stock.
The portion of passive category stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the section 245A subcategory of the passive category equals the sum of—
(A) The value of the portion of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the gross tested income statutory grouping within foreign source passive category income multiplied by a percentage equal to 100 percent minus the United States shareholder's inclusion percentage for passive category gross tested income; and
(B) The value of the portion of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that was assigned to the specified foreign source passive category gross income statutory grouping.
(iv)
Section 245A subgroup of U.S. source category stock.
The portion of U.S. source category stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the section 245A subgroup of the U.S. source category equals the sum of—
(A) The value of the portion of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the U.S. source general category gross tested income statutory grouping multiplied by a percentage equal to 100 percent minus the United States shareholder's inclusion percentage for the general category;
(B) The value of the portion of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the U.S. source passive category gross tested income statutory grouping multiplied by a percentage equal to 100 percent minus the United States shareholder's inclusion percentage for the passive category;
(C) The value of the resourced gross tested income stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is not assigned to a particular treaty category under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section (Step 3);
(D) The value of the portion of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the specified U.S. source general category gross income statutory grouping; and
(E) The value of the portion of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the specified U.S. source passive category gross income statutory grouping.
(v)
Non-section 245A subgroup.
The value of stock of a controlled foreign corporation that is not assigned to the section 245A subgroup within the general or passive category or the residual grouping is assigned to the non-section 245A subgroup within such category or grouping. The value of stock of a controlled foreign corporation that is assigned to the section 951A category, the separate category for income described in section 901(j)(1), or a particular treaty category is always assigned to a non-section 245A subgroup.

Example 1: Asset method
—(i)
Facts
—(A) USP, a domestic corporation, directly owns all of the stock of a controlled foreign corporation, CFC1. The tax book value of CFC1's stock is $20,000x. USP uses the asset method described in § 1.861-12T(c)(3)(ii) to characterize the stock of CFC1. USP's inclusion percentage is 70%.
(B) CFC1 owns the following assets with the following values as determined under §§ 1.861-9(g)(2) and 1.861-9T(g)(3): Assets that generate income described in the foreign source gross tested income statutory grouping within the general category ($4,000x), assets that generate income described in the foreign source gross subpart F income statutory grouping within the general category ($1,000x), assets that generate specified foreign source general category gross income ($3,000x), and assets that generate income described in the foreign source gross subpart F income statutory grouping within the passive category ($2,000x).
(C) CFC1 also owns all of the stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation. The tax book value of CFC1's stock in CFC2 is $6,000x. CFC2 owns the following assets with the following values as determined under §§ 1.861-9(g)(2) and 1.861-9T(g)(3): Assets that generate income described in the foreign source gross subpart F income statutory grouping within the general category ($2,250x) and assets that generate specified foreign source general category gross income ($750x).

)
Characterization of CFC1 stock.
CFC1 has total assets of $16,000x, $4,000x of which are in the foreign source gross tested income statutory
grouping within the general category, $5,500x of which are in the foreign source gross subpart F income statutory grouping within the general category (including the portion of CFC2 stock assigned to that statutory grouping), $4,500x of which are in the specified foreign source gross general category income statutory grouping (including the portion of CFC2 stock assigned to that statutory grouping), and $2,000x of which are in the foreign source gross subpart F income statutory grouping within the passive category. Accordingly, CFC1's stock is characterized as $5,000x ($4,000x/$16,000x × $20,000x) in the foreign source gross tested income statutory grouping within the general category, $6,875x ($5,500x/$16,000x × $20,000x) in the foreign source gross subpart F income statutory grouping within the general category, $5,625x ($4,500x/$16,000x × $20,000x) in the specified foreign source gross general category income statutory grouping, and $2,500x ($2,000x/$16,000x × $20,000x) in the foreign source gross subpart F income statutory grouping within the passive category.
(B)
Step 2.
The value of the portion of the stock of CFC1 that is general category gross tested income stock is $5,000x. USP's inclusion percentage is 70%. Accordingly, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, $3,500x of the stock of CFC1 is assigned to the section 951A category and a portion thereof may be treated as an exempt asset under § 1.861-8(d)(2)(ii)(C)(

Example 3: Modified gross income method
—(i)
Facts
—(A) USP, a domestic corporation, directly owns all of the stock of a controlled foreign corporation, CFC1. The tax book value of CFC1's stock is $100,000x. CFC1 owns all of the stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation. USP uses the modified gross income method described in § 1.861-12(c)(3)(iii) to characterize the stock in CFC1. USP's inclusion percentage is 100%.
(B) CFC1 earns $1,500x of foreign source gross tested income within the general category and $500x of foreign source gross subpart F income within the passive category. CFC1 incurs $1,000x of interest expense.
(C) CFC2 earns $3,000x of foreign source gross tested income within the general category, $2,000x of foreign source gross subpart F income within the general category, and $1,000x of specified foreign source general category gross income. CFC2 incurs $3,000x of interest expense.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Step 1
—(
1
)
Determination of CFC2 gross income (net of interest expense).
CFC2 has total gross income of $6,000x. CFC2's $3,000x of interest expense is apportioned among the statutory groupings of gross income based on the gross income of CFC2 to determine the gross income (net of interest expense) of CFC2 in each statutory grouping. As a result, $1,500x ($3,000x/$6,000x × $3,000x) of interest expense is apportioned to foreign source gross tested income within the general category, $1,000x ($2,000x/$6,000x × $3,000x) of interest expense is apportioned to foreign source gross subpart F income within the general category, and $500x ($1,000x/$6,000x × $3,000x) of interest expense is apportioned to specified foreign source general category gross income. Accordingly, CFC2 has the following amounts of gross income (net of interest expense): $1,500x ($3,000x − $1,500x) of foreign source gross tested income within the general category, $1,000x ($2,000x − $1,000x) of foreign source gross subpart F income within the general category, and $500x ($1,000x − $500x) of specified foreign source general category gross income.
(

)
Determination of CFC1 gross income (net of interest expense).
Before including the gross income consisting of subpart F income (net of interest expense) of CFC2, CFC1 has total gross income of $4,000x, including $1500x of CFC2's foreign source gross tested income within the general category and $500x of CFC2's specified foreign source general category gross income which are combined with CFC1's items of gross income under § 1.861-9(j)(2)(ii). CFC1's $1,000x of interest expense is apportioned among the statutory groupings of gross income of CFC1 to determine the gross income (net of interest expense) of CFC1 in each statutory grouping. As a result, $750x ($3,000x/$4,000x × $1,000x) of interest expense is apportioned to foreign source gross tested income within the general category, $125x ($500x/$4,000 × $1,000x) to foreign source gross subpart F income within the passive category, and $125x ($500x/$4,000x × $1,000x) to specified foreign source general category gross income. Accordingly, CFC1 has the following amounts of gross income (net of interest expense) before including the gross income consisting of subpart F income (net of interest expense) of CFC2: $2,250x ($3,000x − $750x) of foreign source gross tested income within the general category, $375x ($500x − $125x) of foreign source gross subpart F income within the passive category, and $375x ($500 − $125x) of specified foreign
source general category gross income. After including the gross income consisting of subpart F income (net of interest expense) of CFC2, CFC1 has the following amounts of gross income (net of interest expense): $2,250x of foreign source gross tested income within the general category, $1,000x of foreign source gross subpart F income within the general category, $375x of specified foreign source general category gross income, and $375x of foreign source gross subpart F income within the passive category.

)
Characterization of CFC1 stock.
CFC1 is considered to have a total of $4,000x of gross income (net of interest expense) for purposes of characterizing the stock of CFC1. Accordingly, CFC1's stock is characterized as $56,250x ($2,250x/$4,000x × $100,000x) in the foreign source gross tested income statutory grouping within the general category, $25,000x ($1,000x/$4,000x × $100,000x) in the foreign source gross subpart F income statutory grouping within the general category, $9,375x ($375x/$4,000x × $100,000x) in the specified foreign source general category gross income statutory grouping, and $9,375x ($375x/$4,000x × $100,000x) in the foreign source gross subpart F income statutory grouping within the passive category.
(B)
Step 2.
The value of the portion of the stock of CFC1 that is general category gross tested income stock is $56,250x. USP's inclusion percentage is 100%. Accordingly, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, all of the $56,250x of the stock of CFC1 is assigned to the section 951A category and a portion thereof may be treated as an exempt asset under § 1.861-8(d)(2)(ii)(C)(

)
Passive category stock.
No portion of the passive category stock of CFC1 is in the foreign source gross tested income statutory grouping or the specified foreign source passive category gross income statutory grouping. Accordingly, under paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, no value of the portion of the stock of CFC1 is assigned to the section 245A subgroup. Under paragraph (a)(5)(v) of this section, the passive category stock of CFC1, $9,375x, is assigned to the non-section 245A subgroup of passive category stock.

Definition of affiliated group
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of this section, the term
affiliated group
has the same meaning as is given that term by section 1504. Section 1504(a) defines an affiliated group as one or more chains of includible corporations connected through 80-percent stock ownership with a common parent corporation which is an includible corporation (as defined in section 1504(b)). In the case of a corporation that either becomes or ceases to be a member of the group during the course of the corporation's taxable year, only the expenses incurred by the group member during the period of membership shall be allocated and apportioned as if all members of the group were a single corporation. In this regard, the apportionment factor chosen shall relate only to the period of membership. For example, if apportionment on the basis of assets is chosen, the average amount of assets (tax book value or fair market value) for the taxable year shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of the corporation's taxable year during which the corporation was a member of the affiliated group, and the denominator of which is the number of months within the corporation's taxable year. If apportionment on the basis of gross income is chosen, only gross income generated during the period of membership shall be taken into account. If apportionment on the basis of units sold or sales receipts is chosen, only units sold or sales receipts during the period of membership shall be taken into account. Expenses incurred by the group member during its taxable year, but not during the period of membership, shall be allocated and apportioned without regard to other members of the group.

(i) The expenses that are required to be allocated and apportioned under the rules of this section are expenses that are not directly allocable to specific income-producing activities or property solely of the member of the affiliated group that incurred the expense, including (but not limited to) certain expenses related to research and experimental expenses, supportive functions, deductions under section 250, legal and accounting expenses, and litigation damages awards, prejudgment interest, and settlement payments. Interest expense of members of an affiliated group of corporations is allocated and apportioned under § 1.861-11T and not under the rules of this section. Expenses that are included in inventory costs or that are capitalized are not subject to allocation and apportionment under the rules of this section. In addition, stewardship expenses are not subject to allocation and apportionment under the rules of this section; instead, stewardship expenses of a taxpayer are allocated and apportioned on a separate entity basis without treating members of the affiliated group as a single taxpayer. See § 1.861-8(e)(4)(ii)(A).
(ii) For further guidance, see § 1.861-14T(e)(1)(ii).
(2)
Research and experimental expenditures.
R
E expenditures (as defined in § 1.861-17(a)) in the case of an affiliated group are allocated and apportioned under the rules of § 1.861-17 as if all members of the affiliated group were a single taxpayer. Thus, R
E expenditures are allocated to all gross intangible income of all members of the affiliated group reasonably connected with the relevant broad SIC code category. If fewer than all members of the
affiliated group derive gross intangible income reasonably connected with that relevant broad SIC code category, then such expenditures are apportioned under the rules of this paragraph (e)(2) only among those members, as if those members were a single taxpayer.
(3)
Expenses related to supportive functions.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-14T(e)(3).
(4)
Section 250 deduction.
Except as provided in this paragraph (e)(4), the deduction allowed under section 250(a) (the section 250 deduction) to a member of an affiliated group is allocated and apportioned on a separate entity basis under the rules of § 1.861-8(e)(13) and (14). However, the section 250 deduction of a member of a consolidated group is not directly allocable to specific income-producing activities or property solely of the member of the affiliated group that is allowed the deduction. See § 1.1502-50 for rules on applying section 250 and §§ 1.250-1 through 1.250(b)-6 to a member of a consolidated group. In such case, the section 250 deduction is allocated and apportioned as if all members of the consolidated group are treated as a single corporation.
(5)
Legal and accounting fees and expenses; damages awards, prejudgment interest, and settlement payments.
Legal and accounting fees and expenses, as well as litigation or arbitral damages awards, prejudgment interest, and settlement payments, are allocated and apportioned under the rules of § 1.861-8(e)(5). To the extent that under § 1.861-14T(c)(2) and (e)(1)(ii) such expenses are not directly allocable to specific income-producing activities or property of one or more members of the affiliated group, such expenses must be allocated and apportioned as if all members of the affiliated group were a single corporation. Specifically, such expenses must be allocated to a class of gross income that takes into account the gross income which is generated, has been generated, or is reasonably expected to be generated by the other members of the affiliated group. If the expenses relate to the gross income of fewer than all members of the affiliated group as determined under § 1.861-14T(c)(2), then those expenses must be apportioned under the rules of § 1.861-14T(c)(2), as if those fewer members were a single corporation. Such expenses must be apportioned taking into account the apportionment factors contributed by the members of the group that are treated as a single corporation.
(6)
Charitable contribution expenses.
A deduction for a charitable contribution by a member of an affiliated group shall be allocated and apportioned under the rules of §§ 1.861-8(e)(12) and 1.861-14T(c)(1).

(h)
Special rule for the allocation and apportionment of section 818(f)(1) items of a life insurance company
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, life insurance company items specified in section 818(f)(1) (“section 818(f)(1) items”) are allocated and apportioned as if all members of the life subgroup (as defined in § 1.1502-47(b)(8)) were a single corporation (“life subgroup method”). See also § 1.861-8(e)(16) for rules on the allocation of reserve expenses with respect to dividends received by a life insurance company.
(2)
Alternative separate entity treatment.
A consolidated group may choose not to apply the life subgroup method and may instead allocate and apportion section 818(f)(1) items solely among items of the life insurance company that generated the section 818(f)(1) items (“separate entity method”). A consolidated group indicates its choice to apply the separate entity method by applying this paragraph (h)(2) for purposes of the allocation and apportionment of section 818(f)(1) items on its Federal income tax return filed for its first taxable year to which this section applies. A consolidated group's use of the separate entity method constitutes a binding choice to use the method chosen for that year for all members of the consolidated group and all taxable years of such members thereafter. The choice to use the separate entity method may not be revoked without the prior consent of the Commissioner.
(i)-(j) [Reserved]

§ 1.861-14T
Special rules for allocating and apportioning certain expenses (other than interest expense) of an affiliated group of corporations (temporary).
(a)
In general.
Section 1.861-11T provides special rules for allocating and apportioning interest expense of an affiliated group of corporations. The rules of this § 1.861-14T also relate to affiliated groups of corporations and implement section 864(e)(6), which requires affiliated group allocation and apportionment of expenses other than interest which are not directly allocable and apportionable to any specific income producing activity or property. In general, the rules of this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. Paragraph (b) of this section describes the scope of the application of the rule for the allocation and apportionment of such expenses of affiliated groups of corporations. Such rule is then set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section contains the definition of the term “affiliated group” for purposes of this section. Paragraph (e) of this section describes the expenses subject to allocation and apportionment under the rules of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules concerning the affiliated group allocation and apportionment of such expenses in computing the combined taxable income of a FSC or DISC and its related supplier. Paragraph (g) of this section describes the treatment of losses caused by apportionment of such expenses in the case of an affiliated group that does not file a consolidated return. Paragraph (h) of this section provides rules concerning the treatment of the reserve expenses of a life insurance company. Paragraph (j) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of this section.
(b)
Scope
—(1)
Application of section 864(e)(6).
Section 864(e)(6) and this section apply to the computation of taxable income for purposes of computing separate limitations on the foreign tax credit under section 904. Section 864(e)(6) and this section also apply in connection with section 907 to determine reductions in the amount allowed as a foreign tax credit under section 901. Section 864(e)(6) and this section also apply to the computation of the combined taxable income of the related supplier and a foreign sales corporation (FSC) (under sections 921 through 927) as well as the combined taxable income of the related supplier and a domestic international sales corporation (DISC) (under sections 991 through 997).
(2)
Nonapplication of section 864(e)(6).
Section 864(e)(6) and this section do not apply to the computation of subpart F income of controlled foreign corporations (under sections 951 through 964) or the computation of effectively connected taxable income of foreign corporations.
(3)
Application of section 864(e)(6) to the computation of combined taxable income of a possessions corporation and its affiliates.
[Reserved]
(c)
General rule for affiliated corporations
—(1)
General rule.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the taxable income of each member of an affiliated group within each statutory grouping shall be determined by allocating and apportioning the expenses described in paragraph (e) of this section of each member according to apportionment fractions which are computed as if all members of such group were a single corporation. For purposes of determining these apportionment fractions, any interaffiliate transactions or property that are duplicative with respect to the measure of apportionment chosen shall be eliminated. For example, in the application of an asset method of apportionment, stock in affiliated corporations shall not be taken into account, and loans between members of an affiliated group shall be treated in accordance with the rules of § 1.861-11T(e). Similarly, in the application of a gross income method of apportionment, interaffiliate dividends and interest, gross income from sales or services, and other interaffiliate gross income shall be eliminated. Likewise, in
the application of a method of apportionment based on units sold or sales receipts, interaffiliate sales shall be eliminated.
(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the rules of § 1.861-8T apply to the allocation and apportionment of the expenses described in paragraph (e) of this section. Thus, allocation under this paragraph (c) is accomplished by determining, with respect to each expense described in paragraph (e), the class of gross income to which the expense is definitely related and then allocating the deduction to such class of gross income. For this purpose, the gross income of all members of the affiliated group must be taken in account. Then, the expense is apportioned by attributing the expense to gross income (within the class to which the expense has been allocated) which is in the statutory grouping and to gross income (within the class) which is in the residual grouping. Section 1.861-8T(c)(1) identifies a number of factors upon which apportionment may be based, such as comparison of units sold, gross sales or receipts, assets used, or gross income. The apportionment method chosen must be applied consistently by each member of the affiliated group in apportioning the expense when more than one member incurred the expense or when members incurred separate portions of the expense. The apportionment fraction must take into account the apportionment factors contributed by all members of the affiliated group. In the case of an affiliated group of corporations that files a consolidated return, consolidated foreign tax credit limitations are computed for the group in accordance with the rules of § 1.1502-4. For purposes of this section the term “taxpayer” refers to the affiliated group (regardless of whether the group files a consolidated return), rather than to the separate members thereof.
(2)
Expenses relating to fewer than all members.
An expense relates to fewer than all members of an affiliated group if the expense is allocable under paragraph (e)(1) of this section to gross income of at least one member other than the member that incurred the expense but fewer than all members of the affiliated group. The taxable income of the member that incurred the expense shall be determined by apportioning that expense under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section as if the members of the affiliated group that derive gross income to which such expense is allocable under paragraph (e)(1) were treated as a single corporation.
(3)
Prior application of section 482.
The rules of this section do not supersede the application of section 482 and the regulations thereunder. Section 482 may be applied effectively to deny a deduction for an expense to one member of an affiliated group and to allow a deduction for that expense to another member of the affiliated group. In cases to which section 482 is applied, expenses shall be reallocated and reapportioned under section 864(e)(6) and this section after taking into account the application of section 482.
(d)(1)-(2) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.861-14(d)(1) and (2).
(e)
Expenses to be allocated and apportioned under this section.
(1)
Expenses not directly traceable to specific income producing activities or property.
(i) For further guidance, see § 1.861-14(e)(1)(i).
(ii) An item of expense is not considered to be directly allocable to specific income producing activities or property solely of the member incurring the expense if, were all members of the affiliated group treated as a single corporation, the expense would not be considered definitely related, within the meaning of § 1.861-8T(b)(2), only to a class of gross income derived solely by the member which actually incurred the expense. Furthermore, the expense is presumed not to be definitely related only to a class of gross income derived solely by the member incurring the expense (and is, therefore, presumed not to be directly allocable to specific income producing activities or property of that member) unless the taxpayer is able affirmatively to establish otherwise. As provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, expenses described in this paragraph (e)(1) generally shall be apportioned by the member incurring the expense according to apportionment fractions computed as if all members of the affiliated group were a single corporation. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, however, an expense shall be
apportioned according to apportionment fractions computed as if only some (but fewer than all) members of the affiliated group were a single corporation, if the expense is considered allocable to gross income of at least one member other than the member incurring the expense but fewer than all members of the affiliated group. An item of expense shall be considered to be allocable to gross income of fewer than all members of the group if, were all members of the affiliated group treated as a single corporation, the expense would not be considered definitely related within the meaning of § 1.861-8T(b)(2) to gross income derived by all members of the group. In such case, the expense shall be considered allocable, for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, to gross income of those members of the group that generated (or could reasonably be expected to generate) the gross income to which the expense would be considered definitely related if the group were treated as a single corporation.
(2)
Research and experimental expenses.
(i) For further guidance, see § 1.861-14(e)(2)(i) and (ii).
(ii) [Reserved]
(3)
Expenses related to supportive functions.
Expenses which are supportive in nature (such as overhead, general and administrative, supervisory expenses, advertising, marketing, and other sales expenses) are to be allocated and apportioned in accordance with the rules of § 1.861-8T(b)(3). To the extent that such expenses are not directly allocable under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section to specific income producing activities or property of the member of the affiliated group that incurred the expense, such expenses must be allocated and apportioned as if all members of the affiliated group were a single corporation in accordance with the rules of paragraph (c) of this section. Specifically, such expenses must be allocated to a class of gross income that take into account gross income that is generated, has been generated, or could reasonably have been expected to have been generated by the members of the affiliated group. If the expenses relate to the gross income of fewer than all members of the affiliated group as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, then those expenses must be apportioned under the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, as if those fewer members were a single corporation. See
Example
(3) of paragraph (j) of this section. Such expenses must be apportioned between statutory and residual groupings of income within the appropriate class of gross income by reference to the apportionment factors contributed by the members of the affiliated group that are treated as a single corporation.
(4)
Section 250 deduction.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-14(e)(4).
(5)
Legal and accounting fees and expenses; damages awards, prejudgment interest, and settlement payments.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-14(e)(5).
(f)
Computation of FSC or DISC combined taxable income.
In the computation under the pricing rules of sections 925 and 994 of the combined taxable income of any FSC or DISC and its related supplier which are members of an affiliated group, the combined taxable income of such FSC or DISC and its related supplier shall be reduced by the portion of the expenses of the affiliated group described in paragraph (e) of this section that is incurred in connection with export sales involving that FSC or DISC. In order to determine the portion of the expenses of the affiliated group that is incurred in connection with export sales by or through a FSC or DISC, the portion of the total of the apportionment factor chosen that relates to the generation of that export income must be determined. Thus, if gross income is the apportionment factor chosen, the portion of total gross income of the affiliated group that consists of combined gross income derived from transactions involving the FSC or DISC and related supplier must be determined. Similarly, if units sold or sales receipts is the apportionment factor chosen, the portion of total units sold or sales receipts that generated export income of the FSC or DISC and related supplier must be determined. The amount of the expense shall then be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the export related apportionment factor as determined above, and the denominator of which is the total apportionment factor. Thus, if gross income is the apportionment
factor chosen, apportionment is based on a fraction, the numerator of which is export related combined gross income of the FSC or DISC and related supplier and the denominator of which is the total gross income of the affiliated group. Similarly, if units sold or sales receipts is the apportionment factor chosen, the fraction is the units sold or sales receipts that generated export income of the FSC or DISC and related supplier over the total units sold or sales receipts of the affiliated group. Under this rule, expenses of other group members may be attributed to the combined gross income of a FSC of DISC and its related supplier without affecting the amount of expenses (other than any commission payable by the related supplier to the FSC or DISC) otherwise deductible by the FSC or DISC, the related supplier, or other members of the affiliated group. The FSC or DISC must calculate combined taxable income, taking into account any reduction by expenses attributed from other members of the affiliated group to determine the commission derived by the FSC or DISC or the transfer price of qualifying export property sold to the FSC or DISC.
(g)
Losses created through apportionment.
In the case of an affiliated group that does not file a consolidated return, the taxable income in any separate limitation category must be adjusted under this paragraph (g) for purposes of computing the separate foreign tax credit limitations under section 904(d). As a consequence of the affiliated group allocation and apportionment of expenses required by section 864(e)(6) and this section, expenses of a group member may be apportioned for section 904 purposes to a limitation category with a consequent loss in that limitation category. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “limitation category” includes domestic source income, as well as the types of income described in section 904(d)(1) (A) through (I). A loss of one affiliate in a limitation category will reduce the income of another member in the same limitation category if a consolidated return is filed. (
See
§ 1.1502-4.) If a consolidated return is not filed, this netting does not occur. Accordingly, in such a case, the following adjustments among members are required, in order to give effect to the group allocation of expense:
(1) Losses created through group apportionment of expense in one or more limitation categories within a given member must be eliminated; and
(2) A corresponding amount of income of other members in the same limitation category must be recharacterized.
Such adjustments shall be accomplished in accordance with the rules of § 1.861-11T(g).

Examples 1 and 4 of this paragraph (j) apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018.

# Example 1:
(i)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of X and all of the stock of Y. P, X and Y are domestic corporations. P is a holding company for the stock of X and Y. Both X and Y manufacture and sell a product which is included in a broad product category listed in § 1.861-8(e)(3)(i). During 1988, X incurred $100,000 on research connected with that product. All of the research was performed in the United States. In 1988, the domestic sales by X of the product totalled $400,000 and the foreign sales of the product totalled $200,000; Y's domestic sales of the product totalled $200,000 and Y's foreign sales of the product totalled $200,000. In 1988, X's gross income is $300,000, of which $200,000 is from domestic sales and $100,000 is from foreign sales; Y's gross income is $200,000 of which $100,000 is from domestic sales and $100,000 is from foreign sales.
(ii) P, X and Y are affiliated corporations within the meaning of section 864(e)(5) and this section. The research expenses incurred by X are allocable to all income connected with the relevant broad category listed in § 1.861-8T(e)(3)(i). Both X and Y have gross income includible within the class of gross income related to that product category. Accordingly, the research and experimental expenses incurred by X are to be allocated and apportioned as if X and Y were a single corporation. The apportionment for 1988 is as follows:

# Example 2:
(i)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of X, which owns all of the stock of Y. P, X and Y are all domestic corporations. P has incurred general training program expenses of $100,000 in 1987. Employees of P, X and Y participate in the training program. In 1987, P had United States source gross income of $200,000 and foreign source general limitation income of $200,000; X had U.S. source gross income of $100,000 and foreign source general limitation income of $100,000; and Y had U.S. source gross income of $300,000 and foreign source general limitation income of $100,000.
(ii)
Analysis.
P, X and Y are an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of section 864(e)(5). The training expenses incurred by P are not definitely related solely to specific income producing activities or property of P. The employees of X and Y also participate in the training program. Thus, this expense relates to gross income generated by P, X and Y. This expense is definitely related and allocable to all of the gross income from foreign and domestic sources of P, X and Y. It is assumed that apportionment on the basis of gross income is reasonable. The apportionment of the expense is as follows:
Apportionment of $100,000 expense to foreign source general limitation income:
EC07OC91.022
Apportionment of $100,000 expense to United States source gross income:

# Example 3:
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example
(2) above, except that only employees of P and X participate in the training program.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because only the employees of P and X participate in the training program and they perform no services for Y, the expense relates only to gross income generated by P and X. Accordingly, the $100,000 expense must be allocated and apportioned as if P and X were a single corporation. The apportionment of the $100,000 expense is as follows:
Apportionment of $100,000 expense to foreign source general limitation income:
EC07OC91.024
Apportionment of $100,000 expense to U.S. source gross income:
EC07OC91.025

# Example 4:
(i)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of X which owns all of the stock of Y. P and X are domestic corporations; Y is a foreign corporation. In 1987 P incurred $10,000 of stewardship expenses relating to an audit of Y.
(ii)
Analysis.
The stewardship expenses incurred by P are not directly allocable to specific income producing activities or property of P. The expense is definitely related and allocable to dividends received or to be received by X. Accordingly, the expense of P is allocated and apportioned as if P and X were a single corporation. The expense is definitely related to dividends received or to be received by X from Y, a foreign corporation. Such dividends are foreign source general limitation income. Thus, the entire amount of the expense must be allocated to foreign source dividend income.

# Example 5:
(i)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of X which owns all of the stock of Y. P, X and Y are all domestic corporations. In 1987, P incurred $10,000 legal expense relating to the testimony of certain employees of P in connection with litigation to which Y is a party. This expense is not allocable to specific income of Y. In 1987, Y had $100,000 foreign source general limitation income and $300,000 U.S. source gross income.
(ii)
Analysis.
The legal expenses incurred by P are not definitely related solely to specific income producing activities or property of P. The expense is definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income which includes only gross income generated by Y. Accordingly, the expense of P is allocated and apportioned as if Y were the only member of the affiliated group, as follows:

# Example 6:
(i)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of R, which owns all of the stock of F. P and R are domestic corporations, and F is a foreign sales corporation under section 922 of the Code. R and F have entered into an agreement whereby F is paid a commission with respect to sales of product A. In 1987, P had gross receipts of $1,000,000 from domestic sales of product A, and gross receipts of $1,000,000 from foreign sales of product A. R had gross receipts of $1,000,000 from domestic sales of product A, and $1,000,000 from export sales of product A. R's cost of goods sold attributable to export sales is $500,000. R has deductible expenses of $100,000 directly related to its export sales, and F has such deductible expenses of $100,000. During 1987, P incurred an expense of $100,000 for marketing studies involving the worldwide market for product A.
(ii)
Analysis.
P and R are an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of section 864(e)(5) and this section. The expense incurred by P for marketing studies regarding the worldwide market for product A is an expense that is not directly related solely to the activities of P, but also to the activities of R. This expense must be allocated and apportioned under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, as if P and R were a single corporation. The expense is allocable to the class of gross income that includes all gross income generated by sales of product A. Apportionment on the basis of gross receipts is reasonable under these facts. F, a foreign corporation, is not a member of the affiliated group. However, for purposes of determining F's commission on its sales, the combined gross income of F and R must be reduced by the portion of the marketing studies expense of P that is incurred in connection with export sales involving F under the rules of paragraph (f) of this section. The computation of the combined taxable income of R and F is as follows:
Combined Taxable Income of R and F
R's gross receipts from export sales
$1,000,000
R's cost of goods sold
$500,000

§ 1.861-15
Income from certain aircraft or vessels first leased on or before December 28, 1980.
(a)
General rule.
A taxpayer who owns an aircraft or vessel described in paragraph (b) of this section and who leases the aircraft or vessel to a United States person (other than a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 1563) as the taxpayer) may elect under paragraph (f) of this section to treat all amounts includible in gross income with respect to the aircraft or vessel as income from sources within the United States for any taxable year ending after the commencement of the lease. This paragraph (a) applies only with respect to taxable years ending after August 15, 1971, and only with respect to leases entered into after that date of aircraft or vessels first leased by the taxpayer on or before December 28, 1980. An election once made applies to the taxable year for which made and to all subsequent taxable years unless it is revoked or terminated in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. A taxpayer need not be a United States person to be eligible to make the election under this section, unless otherwise required by a provision of law not contained in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. In addition, the taxpayer need not be a bank or other financial institution to be eligible to make this election. The term “United States person” as used in
this section has the meaning assigned to it by section 7701(a)(30).
(b)
Property to which the election applies
—(1)
Section 38 property.
An election made under this section may be made only if the aircraft or vessel is section 38 property, or property which would be section 38 property but for section 48(a)(5) (relating to property used by governmental units), at the time the election is made and for all taxable years to which the election applies. The aircraft or vessel must be property which qualifies for the investment credit under section 38 unless the property does not qualify because it is described in section 48(a)(5). If an aircraft is used predominantly outside the United States (determined under § 1.48-1(g)(1)), it must qualify under the provisions of section 48(a)(2)(B)(i) and § 1.48-1(g)(2)(i). If a vessel is used predominantly outside the United States, it must qualify under the provisions of section 48(a)(2)(B)(iii) and § 1.48-1(g)(2)(iii). The aircraft or vessel may not be suspension or termination period property described in section 48(h) or section 49(a) (as in effect before the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1978). See paragraph (g) (3) and (4) of this section for rules which apply if the property ceases to be section 38 property.
(2)
United States manufacture or construction.
An election under this section may be made only if the aircraft or vessel is manufactured or constructed in the United States. The aircraft or vessel will be considered to be manufactured or constructed in the United States if 50 percent or more of the basis of the aircraft or vessel is attributable to value added within the United States.
(3)
Exclusion of certain property used outside the United States.
The term “aircraft or vessel” as used in this paragraph (b) does not include any property which is used predominantly outside the United States and which qualifies as section 38 property under—
(i) Section 48(a)(2)(B)(v), relating to containers used in the transportation of property to and from the United States,
(ii) Section 48(a)(2)(B)(vi), relating to certain property used for the purpose of exploring for, developing, removing, or transporting resources from the Outer Continental Shelf, or
(iii) Section 48(a)(2)(B)(x), relating to certain property used in international or territorial waters.
(c)
Leases or subleases to which the election applies.
At the time the election under this section is made and for all taxable years for which the election applies, the lessee of the aircraft or vessel must be a United States person. In addition, the aircraft or vessel may not be subleased to a person who is not a United States person unless the sublease is a short-term sublease. For purposes of this section, a short-term sublease is a sublease for a period of time (including any period for which the sublease may be renewed or extended) which is less than 30 percent of the asset guideline period of the aircraft or vessel leased (determined under section 167(m)). See paragraphs (g) (3) and (4) of this section for rules which apply if the requirements of this paragraph (c) are not met.
(d)
Income to which the election applies.
An election under this section applies to all amounts derived by the taxpayer with respect to the aircraft or vessel which is subject to the election. The election applies to all amounts which are includible in the taxpayer's gross income whether or not includible during or after the period of a lease to which the election applies. Amounts derived by the taxpayer with respect to the aircraft or vessel include any gain from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of the aircraft or vessel. If by reason of the allowance of expenses and other deductions, there is a loss with respect to an aircraft or vessel, the election applies to treat the loss as having a source within the United States. Similarly, if the sale, exchange or other disposition of the aircraft or vessel which is subject to an election results in a loss, it is treated as having a source within the United States. See paragraph (e)(2) of this section for the application of an election under this section to the income of certain transferees or distributees.
(e)
Effect of election
—(1)
In general.
An election under this section applies to the taxable year for which it is made and to all subsequent taxable years for
which amounts in respect of the aircraft or vessel to which the election relates are includible in gross income. However, the election may be revoked under paragraph (g) (1) or (2) of this section or terminated under paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
(2)
Certain transfers involving carryover of basis.
(i) If an electing taxpayer transfers or distributes an aircraft or vessel which is subject to the election under this section, the transferee or distributee will be treated as having made an election under this section with respect to the aircraft or vessel if the basis of the aircraft or vessel in the hands of the transferee or distributee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor or distributor. This paragraph (e)(2)(i) applies even though the transferor or distributor recognizes an amount of gain which increases basis in the hands of the transferee or distributee and even though the transferee of distributee is a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation. For example, if a corporation distributes a vessel which is subject to an election under this section to its parent corporation in a complete liquidation described in section 332(b), the parent corporation will be required to treat all amounts includible in its gross income with respect to the vessel as income from source within the United States if, unless the election is revoked or terminated under paragraph (g) of this section, the basis of the property in the hands of the parent is determined under section 334(b)(1) (relating to the general rule on carryover of basis). In further illustration, if a corporation distributes a vessel (subject to an election) in a distribution to which section 301(a) applies, the distributee will be treated as having made the election with respect to the vessel if its basis is determined under section 301(d)(2) (relating to basis of corporate distributees) even though the basis is the fair market value of the vessel under section 301(d)(2)(A).
(ii) If a member of an affiliated group which files a consolidated return transfers an aircraft or vessel subject to an election to another member of that group, the transferee will be treated as having made the election with respect to the aircraft or vessel. In addition, if a partnership distributes an aircraft or vessel subject to an election to a partner, the partner will be treated as having made the election with respect to the aircraft or vessel.
(iii) If paragraph (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section do not apply, the election under this section with respect to an aircraft or vessel will not be considered as made by a transferee or distributee.
(f)
Election
—(1)
Time for making the election.
The election under this section must be made before the expiration of the period prescribed by section 6511(a) (or section 6511(c) if the period is extended by agreement) for making a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by chapter 1 for the first taxable year for which the election is to apply. The period for that first taxable year is determined without regard to the special periods prescribed by section 6511(d).
(2)
Manner of making the election.
An election under this section must be made by filing with the income tax return (or an amended return) for the first taxable year for which the election is to apply a statement, signed by the taxpayer, to the effect that the election under section 861(e) is being made. The statement must—
(i) Set forth sufficient facts to identify the aircraft or vessel which is the subject of the election,
(ii) State that the aircraft or vessel was manufactured or constructed in the United States,
(iii) State that the aircraft or vessel is section 38 property described in § 1.861-9(b) which was leased to a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) pursuant to a lease entered into after August 15, 1971,
(iv) State that the electing taxpayer is the owner of the aircraft or vessel,
(v) State the lessee of the aircraft or vessel is not a member of a controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 1563) of which the taxpayer is a member,
(vi) Give the name and taxpayer identification number of the lessee of the aircraft or vessel, and
(vii) State that the aircraft or vessel is not subject to a sublease (other than a short-term sublease) to any person who is not a United States person.
(3)
Election by partnership.
Any election under this section with respect to an aircraft or vessel owned by a partnership shall be made by the partnership. Any partnership election is applicable to each partner's partnership interest in the aircraft or vessel. However, an election made by a partner before August 8, 1979 will be recognized where the partnership made no election and the election can no longer be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(g)
Termination of election
—(1)
Revocation without consent.
A taxpayer may revoke an election within the time prescribed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section without the consent of the Commissioner. In such a case, the taxpayer must file an amended income tax return for any taxable year to which the election applied.
(2)
Revocation with consent.
Except as provided in paragraph (g) (1) or (3) of this section, an election made under this section is binding unless consent to revoke is obtained from the Commissioner. A request to revoke the election must be made in writing and addressed to the Assistant Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Technical), Attention: T:C:C:3, Washington, DC 20224. The request must include the name and address of the taxpayer and be signed by the taxpayer or his duly authorized representative. It must specify the taxable year or years for which the revocation is to be effective and must be filed at least 90 days prior to the time (not including extensions) prescribed by law for filing the income tax return for the first taxable year for which the revocation of the election is to be effective or by November 6, 1979 whichever is later. The request must specify the grounds which are considered to justify the revocation. The Commissioner may require such additional information as may be necessary in order to determine whether the proposed revocation will be permitted. Consent will generally not be given to revoke an election where the revocation would result in treating gross income with respect to the aircraft or vessel (including any gain from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of such aircraft or vessel) as income from sources without the United States where, during the period the election was in effect, there were losses from sources within the United States. A copy of the consent of the Commissioner to revoke must be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return (or amended return) for each taxable year affected by the revocation.
(3)
Automatic termination.
If an aircraft or vessel subject to an election under section 861(e) ceases to be section 38 property, ceases to be leased by its owner directly to a United States person, or is subleased (other than a short-term sublease) to a person who is not a United States person, within the period set forth in section 6511(a) (or section 6511(c) if the period is extended by agreement) for making a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by chapter 1 for the first taxable year for which the election applied, then the election with respect to such aircraft or vessel will automatically terminate. If the election terminates, the taxpayer who made the election must file an amended tax return or claim for credit or refund, as the case may be, for any taxable year to which the election applied.
(4)
Factors not causing revocation or termination.
The fact that an aircraft or vessel ceases to be section 38 property, ceases to be leased by its owner directly to a United States person, or is leased or subleased for any period of time to a person who is not a United States person, after expiration of the period set forth in section 6511(a) (or section 6511(c) if the period is extended by agreement) for making a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by chapter 1 for the first taxable year for which the election applied, will not cause a termination of the election made under this section with respect to the aircraft or vessel. For example, the electing taxpayer is not relieved from any of the consequences of making the election merely because the aircraft or vessel is subleased to a person who is not a United States person for a period in excess of that allowed for short-term subleases under paragraph (c) of this section after expiration of the later of 3 years from the time the return was filed for the first taxable year to which the election applied or 2 years from the
time the tax was paid for that year where the period set forth in section 6511(a) has not been extended by agreement.
(5)
Effect of revocation or termination.
If an election is revoked or terminated under this paragraph (g), the taxpayer is required to recompute the tax for the appropriate taxable years without reference to section 861(e)(1).
(6)
Revocation or termination after December 28, 1980.
The rules in paragraph (g)(1) through (g)(5) continue to apply with respect to any election made pursuant to this section even though the revocation or termination may occur after December 28, 1980.
[T.D. 7635, 44 FR 46457, Aug. 8, 1979, as amended by T.D. 7928, 48 FR 55846, Dec. 16, 1983. Redesignated at 53 FR 35477, Sept. 14, 1988]
§ 1.861-16
Income from certain craft first leased after December 28, 1980.
(a)
General rule.
If a taxpayer—
(1) Owns a qualified craft (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section).
(2) Leases such qualified craft after December 28, 1980, to a United States person that is not a member of the same controlled group of corporations as the taxpayer, and
(3) The lease is the taxpayer's first lease of the craft and the taxpayer is not considered to have made an election with respect to the craft under § 1.861-9(e)(2),
then the taxpayer shall treat all amounts includible in gross income with respect to the qualified craft as income from sources within the United States for each taxable year ending after commencement of the lease. If this section applies to income with respect to a craft, it applies to all such amounts that are includible in the taxpayer's gross income, whether or not includible during or after the period of a lease to a United States person. Amounts derived by the taxpayer with respect to the qualified craft include any gain from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of the qualified craft. If this section applies to income with respect to a craft and there is a loss with respect to that craft (either due to the allowance of expenses and other deductions or due to a sale, exchange, or other disposition of the qualified craft), such loss is treated as allocable or apportionable to sources within the United States. The fact that a craft ceases to be section 38 property, ceases to be leased by the taxpayer to a United States person, or is leased or subleased for any period of time to a person who is not a United States person will not terminate the application of this section.
(b)
Qualified craft
—(1)
In general.
A qualified craft is a vessel, aircraft, or spacecraft that—
(i) Is section 38 property (or would be section 38 property but for section 48(a)(5), relating to use by governmental units), and
(ii) Is manufactured or constructed in the United States.
(2)
Vessel.
The term “vessel” includes every type of watercraft capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, and any items of property that are affixed in a permanent fashion or are integral to the vessel. A vessel that is used predominately outside the United States must be described in section 48(a)(2)(B)(iii) and § 1.48-1(g)(2)(iii), relating to vessels documented for use in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States, to be a qualified craft.
(3)
Aircraft.
An aircraft used predominantly outside the United States must be described in section 48(a)(2)(B)(i) and § 1.48-1(g)(2)(i), relating to aircraft registered by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency, and operated to and from the United States or operated under contract with the United States, to be a qualified craft.
(4)
Spacecraft.
A spacecraft must be described in section 48(a)(2)(B)(viii) and § 1.48-1(g)(2)(viii), relating to communications satellites, or any interest therein, of a United States person, to be a qualified craft.
(5)
United States manufacture or construction.
A craft will be considered to be manufactured or constructed in the United States if 50 percent or more of the basis of the craft on the date of the lease to a United States person is attributable to value added within the United States.
(c)
United States person.
For purposes of this section, the term “United States person” includes those persons
described in section 7701(a)(30) and individuals with respect to whom an election under section 6013 (g) or (h) (relating to nonresident alien individuals married to United States citizens or residents) is in effect.
(d)
Controlled group.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, whether a taxpayer and a United States person are members of the same controlled group of corporations is determined under section 1563. Solely for purposes of this section, if at least 80% of the capital interest, or the profits interest, in a partnership is owned, directly or indirectly, by a member or members of a controlled group of corporations, then the partnership shall be considered a member of that controlled group of corporations. In addition, if at least 80% of the capital interest, or the profits interest, in a partnership is owned, directly or indirectly, by a corporation, then the partnership and that corporation shall be considered members of a controlled group of corporations.
(e)
Certain transfers and distributions
—(1)
Transfers and distributions involving carryover of basis.
If—
(i) The income with respect to a craft is subject to this section,
(ii) The taxpayer transfers or distributes such craft, and
(iii) The basis of such craft in the hands of the transferee or distributee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor or distributor,
then this section will apply to the income with respect to the craft includible in the gross income of the transferee or distributee. This paragraph (e)(1) applies even though the transferor or distributor recognizes an amount of gain that increases basis in the hands of the transferee or distributee and even though the transferee or distributee is a nonresident alien or foreign corporation. For example, if a corporation distributes a craft the income of which is subject to this section to its parent corporation in a complete liquidation described in section 332(b), the parent corporation will be treated as if it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to such craft if the basis of the property in the hands of the parent corporation is determined under section 334(b) (relating to the general rule on carryover of basis in liquidations). In further illustration, if a corporation distributes a craft the income of which is subject to this section, in a distribution to which section 301(a) applies, the distributee will be treated as if it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to such craft if its basis is determined under section 301(d)(2) (relating to basis of corporate distributees) even though the basis may be the fair market value of the craft under section 301(d)(2)(A).
(2)
Partnerships.
If a partnership satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, each partner shall treat all amounts includible in gross income with respect to the craft as income from sources within the United States for any taxable year of the partnership ending after commencement of the lease. In addition, if a partnership distributes a craft the income of which is subject to this section, to a partner, the partner will be treated as if he or she satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to such craft.
(3)
Affiliated groups.
If a member of a group of corporations that files a consolidated return transfers a craft, the income of which is subject to this section, to another member of that same group, the transferee will be treated as if it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the craft.
[T.D. 7928, 48 FR 55846, Dec. 16, 1983. Redesignated by T.D. 8228, 53 FR 35477, Sept. 14, 1988]
§ 1.861-17
Allocation and apportionment of research and experimental expenditures.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules for the allocation and apportionment of research and experimental expenditures that a taxpayer deducts, or amortizes and deducts, in a taxable year under section 174 or section 59(e) (applicable to expenditures that are allowable as a deduction under section 174(a)) (
R
E expenditures
). R
E expenditures do not include any expenditures that are not deductible expenses by reason of the second sentence under
§ 1.482-7(j)(3)(i) (relating to CST Payments (as defined in § 1.482-7(b)(1)) owed to a controlled participant in a cost sharing arrangement).
(b)
Allocation
—(1)
In general.
The method of allocation and apportionment of R
E expenditures set forth in this section recognizes that research and experimentation is an inherently speculative activity, that findings may contribute unexpected benefits, and that the gross income derived from successful research and experimentation must bear the cost of unsuccessful research and experimentation. In addition, the method set forth in this section recognizes that successful R
E expenditures ultimately result in the creation of intangible property that will be used to generate income. Therefore, R
E expenditures ordinarily are considered deductions that are definitely related to gross intangible income (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) reasonably connected with the relevant SIC code category (or categories) of the taxpayer and therefore allocable to gross intangible income as a class related to the SIC code category (or categories) and apportioned under the rules in this section. For purposes of the allocation under this paragraph (b)(1), a taxpayer's SIC code category (or categories) are determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For purposes of this section, the term
intangible property
means intangible property (as defined in section 367(d)(4)), including intangible property either created or acquired by the taxpayer, that is derived from R
E expenditures.
(2)
Definition of gross intangible income.
The term
gross intangible income
means all gross income earned by a taxpayer that is attributable to a sale or license of intangible property (including income from platform contribution transactions described in § 1.482-7(b)(1)(ii), royalty income from the licensing of intangible property, or amounts taken into account under section 367(d) by reason of a transfer of intangible property), and the full amount of gross income from sales or leases of products or services if the income is derived directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) from intangible property. Gross intangible income also includes a distributive share of any amounts described in the previous sentence, but does not include dividends or any amounts included in income under section 951, 951A, or 1293. See § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi) for rules addressing the assignment of gross income, including gross intangible income, to a separate category by reason of certain disregarded payments to or from a taxpayer's foreign branch.
(3)
SIC code categories
—(i)
Allocation based on SIC code categories.
Ordinarily, a taxpayer's R
E expenditures are incurred to produce gross intangible income that is reasonably connected with one or more relevant SIC code categories. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, where research and experimentation is conducted with respect to more than one SIC code category, the taxpayer may aggregate the categories for purposes of allocation and apportionment, provided the categories are in the same Major Group. However, the taxpayer may not subdivide any categories. Where research and experimentation is not clearly related to any SIC code category (or categories), it will be considered conducted with respect to all of the taxpayer's SIC code categories.
(ii)
Use of three digit standard industrial classification codes.
A taxpayer determines the relevant Major Groups and SIC code categories by reference to the two digit and three digit classification, respectively, of the Standard Industrial Classification Manual (SIC code). The SIC Manual is available at
https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html.
(iii)
Consistency.
Once a taxpayer selects a SIC code category or Major Group for the first taxable year for which this section applies to the taxpayer, it must continue to use that category in following years unless the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that, due to changes in the relevant facts, a change in the category is appropriate. Therefore, once a taxpayer elects a permissible aggregation of three digit SIC code categories into a two digit Major Group, it must continue to use that two digit category in following years unless the taxpayer establishes to the
satisfaction of the Commissioner that, due to changes in the relevant facts, a change is appropriate.
(iv)
Wholesale trade and retail trade categories.
A taxpayer must use a SIC code category within the divisions of “wholesale trade” or “retail trade” if it is engaged solely in sales-related activities with respect to a particular category of products. In the case of a taxpayer that conducts material non-sales-related activities with respect to a particular category of products, all R
E expenditures related to sales of the products must be allocated and apportioned as if the expenditures were reasonably connected to the most closely related three digit SIC code category other than those within the wholesale and retail trade divisions. For example, if a taxpayer engages in both the manufacturing and assembling of cars and trucks (SIC code 371) and in a wholesaling activity related to motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts and supplies (SIC code 501), the taxpayer must allocate and apportion all R
E expenditures related to both activities as if they relate solely to the manufacturing SIC code 371. By contrast, if the taxpayer engages only in the wholesaling activity related to motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts and supplies, the taxpayer must allocate and apportion all R
E expenditures to the wholesaling SIC code 501.
(c)
Exclusive apportionment.
Solely for purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, an amount equal to fifty percent of a taxpayer's R
E expenditures in a SIC code category (or categories) is apportioned exclusively to the residual grouping of U.S. source gross intangible income if research and experimentation that accounts for at least fifty percent of such R
E expenditures was performed in the United States. Similarly, an amount equal to fifty percent of a taxpayer's R
E expenditures in a SIC code category (or categories) is apportioned exclusively to the statutory grouping (or groupings) of foreign source gross intangible income in that SIC code category if research and experimentation that accounts for more than fifty percent of such R
E expenditures was performed outside the United States. If there are multiple separate categories with foreign source gross intangible income in the SIC code category, the fifty percent of R
E expenditures apportioned under the previous sentence is apportioned ratably to foreign source gross intangible income based on the relative amounts of gross receipts from gross intangible income in the SIC code category in each separate category, as determined under paragraph (d) of this section. Solely for purposes of determining whether fifty percent or more of R
E expenditures in a year are performed within or without the United States under this paragraph (c), a taxpayer's R
E expenditures with respect to a taxable year are determined by taking into account only the R
E expenditures incurred in such taxable year (without regard to whether such expenditures are capitalized under section 59(e) or any other provision in the Code), and do not include amounts that were capitalized in a prior taxable year and are deducted in such taxable year.
(d)
Apportionment based on gross receipts from sales of products or services
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer's R
E expenditures not apportioned under paragraph (c) of this section are apportioned between the statutory grouping (or among the statutory groupings) within the class of gross intangible income and the residual grouping within such class according to the rules in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section. See paragraph (b) of this section for defining the class of gross intangible income in relation to SIC code categories.
(i) A taxpayer's R
E expenditures not apportioned under paragraph (c) of this section are apportioned in the same proportions that:
(A) The amounts of the taxpayer's gross receipts from sales and leases of products (as measured by gross receipts without regard to cost of goods sold) or services that are related to gross intangible income within the statutory grouping (or statutory groupings) and in the residual grouping bear, respectively; to
(B) The total amount of such gross receipts in the class.
(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (d), gross receipts from sales and leases
of products are related to gross intangible income if intangible property is embedded or used in connection with the manufacture or sale of such products, and gross income from services is related to gross intangible income if intangible property is incorporated in or directly or indirectly benefits such services. See paragraph (g)(7) of this section (
Example 7
). The amount of the gross receipts used to apportion R
E expenditures also includes gross receipts from sales and leases of products or services of any controlled or uncontrolled party to the extent described in paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section. A royalty or other amount paid to the taxpayer for intangible property constitutes gross intangible income, but is not considered part of gross receipts arising from the sale or lease of a product or service, and so is not taken into account in apportioning the taxpayer's R
E expenditures to its gross intangible income.
(iii) The statutory grouping (or groupings) or residual grouping to which the gross receipts are assigned is the grouping to which the gross intangible income related to the sale, lease, or service is assigned. In cases where the gross intangible income of the taxpayer is income not described in paragraph (d)(3) or (4) of this section, the grouping to which the taxpayer's gross receipts and the gross intangible income are assigned is the same. In cases where the taxpayer's gross intangible income is related to sales, leases, or services described in paragraph (d)(3) or (4) of this section, the gross receipts that will be used for purposes of this paragraph (d) are the gross receipts of the controlled and uncontrolled parties that are taken into account under paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section. The grouping to which the controlled or uncontrolled parties' gross receipts are assigned is determined based on the grouping of the taxpayer's gross intangible income attributable to the license, sale, or other transfer of intangible property to such controlled or uncontrolled party as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i) of this section, and not the grouping to which the gross receipts would be assigned if the assignment were based on the income earned by the controlled or uncontrolled party. See paragraph (g)(1) of this section (
Example 1
). For purposes of applying this paragraph (d)(1)(iii) to section 250 or section 904 as the operative section, the assignment of gross receipts to the general and foreign branch categories is made after taking into account the assignment of gross intangible income to those categories as adjusted by reason of disregarded payments under the rules of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi), and by making similar adjustments to gross receipts under the principles of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi).
(iv) For purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, because a United States person's gross intangible income cannot include income assigned to the section 951A category, no R
E expenditures of a United States person are apportioned to foreign source income in the section 951A category.
(2)
Apportionment in excess of gross income.
Amounts apportioned under this section may exceed the amount of gross income related to the SIC code category within the statutory or residual grouping. In such case, the excess is applied against other gross income within the statutory or residual grouping. See § 1.861-8(d)(1) for applicable rules where the apportionment results in an excess of deductions over gross income within the statutory or residual grouping.
(3)
Sales or services of uncontrolled parties
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of the apportionment within a class under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if a taxpayer reasonably expects an uncontrolled party to (through a license, purchase, or transfer): Acquire intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer's current R
E expenditures; acquire products in which such intangible property is embedded or used in connection with the manufacture or sale of such products; or receive services that incorporate or directly or indirectly benefit from such intangible property, then the gross receipts of the uncontrolled party from sales, licenses, leases, or services of the particular products or services in which the taxpayer's intangible property is embedded or incorporated or which the taxpayer's intangible property directly or
indirectly benefitted are taken into account. If the taxpayer has previously licensed, sold, or transferred intangible property related to a SIC code category to an uncontrolled party, the taxpayer is presumed to expect to license, sell, or transfer to that uncontrolled party all future intangible property related to the same SIC code category. The presumption described in the preceding sentence may be rebutted by the taxpayer with facts that demonstrate that the taxpayer reasonably expects not to license, sell, or transfer future intangible property to the uncontrolled party.
(ii)
Definition of uncontrolled party.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), the term
uncontrolled party
means a person that is not a controlled party as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.
(iii)
Sales of components.
In the case of a sale or lease of a product by an uncontrolled party that is derived from the taxpayer's intangible property but is incorporated as a component of a larger product (for example, where the product incorporating the intangible property is a component of a large machine), only the portion of the gross receipts from the larger product that are attributable to the component derived from the intangible property is included. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a reasonable estimate based on the principles of section 482 must be made. See paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B)(
3
) of this section (
Example 4
).
(iv)
Reasonable estimates of gross receipts.
If the amount of gross receipts of an uncontrolled party is unknown, a reasonable estimate of gross receipts must be made annually. Appropriate economic analyses, based on the principles of section 482, must be used to estimate gross receipts. See paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B)(
3
)(
ii
) of this section (
Example 5
).
(4)
Sales or services of controlled parties
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of the apportionment within a class under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if the controlled party is reasonably expected to (through a license, sale, or transfer): Acquire intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer's current R
E expenditures; acquire products in which such intangible property is embedded or used in connection with the manufacture or sale of such products; or receive services that incorporate or directly or indirectly benefit from such intangible property, then the gross receipts of the controlled party from all of its sales, licenses, leases, or services are taken into account. Except to the extent provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, if the taxpayer has previously licensed, sold, or transferred intangible property related to a SIC code category to a controlled party, the taxpayer is presumed to expect to license, sell, or transfer to that controlled party all future intangible property related to the same SIC code category. The presumption described in the preceding sentence may be rebutted by the taxpayer with facts that demonstrate that the taxpayer will not license, sell, or transfer future intangible property to the controlled party.
(ii)
Definition of a controlled party.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), the term
controlled party
means any person that has a relationship to the taxpayer specified in section 267(b) or 707(b), or is a member of a controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 267(f)) to which the taxpayer belongs. Because an affiliated group is treated as a single taxpayer, a member of an affiliated group is not a controlled party. See paragraph (e) of this section.
(iii)
Gross receipts not to be taken into account more than once.
Sales, licenses, leases, or services among the taxpayer, controlled parties, and uncontrolled parties are not taken into account more than once; in such a situation, the amount of gross receipts of the selling person must be subtracted from the gross receipts of the buying person. Therefore, the gross receipts taken into account under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section generally reflect the gross receipts from sales made to end users.
(iv)
Effect of cost sharing arrangements.
If the controlled party has entered into a cost sharing arrangement, in accordance with the provisions of § 1.482-7, with the taxpayer for the purpose of developing intangible property, then ordinarily the controlled party is not reasonably expected to acquire rights in intangible property that
would arise from the taxpayer's share of the R
E expenditures with respect to the cost shared intangibles as defined in § 1.482-7(j)(1)(i); acquire products in which such intangible property is embedded or used in connection with the manufacture or sale of such products; or receive services that incorporate or directly or indirectly benefit from such intangible property. Therefore, solely for purposes of apportioning a taxpayer's R
E expenditures (which do not include the amount of CST Payments received by the taxpayer; see paragraph (a) of this section) that are intangible development costs (as defined in § 1.482-7(d)) with respect to a cost sharing arrangement, the controlled party's gross receipts are not taken into account for purposes of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(4)(i) of this section. However, the rule in this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) does not apply, and the controlled party's sales are taken into account, to the extent the taxpayer licenses, or has licensed, to the controlled party intangible property resulting from a cost sharing arrangement with the controlled party.
(5)
Application of section 864(e)(3).
Section 864(e)(3) and § 1.861-8(d)(2) do not apply for purposes of this section.
(e)
Affiliated groups.
See § 1.861-14(e)(2) for rules on allocating and apportioning R
E expenditures of an affiliated group (as defined in § 1.861-14(d)).
(f)
Special rules for partnerships
—(1)
R
E expenditures.
For purposes of applying this section, if R
E expenditures are incurred by a partnership in which the taxpayer is a partner, the taxpayer's R
E expenditures include the taxpayer's distributive share of the partnership's R
E expenditures.
(2)
Purpose and location of expenditures.
In applying exclusive apportionment under paragraph (c) of this section, a partner's distributive share of R
E expenditures incurred by a partnership is treated as incurred by the partner for the same purpose and in the same location as incurred by the partnership.
(3)
Apportionment based on gross receipts.
In applying the remaining apportionment under paragraph (d) of this section, if a taxpayer is a partner in a partnership that incurs R
E expenditures described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and the taxpayer is not reasonably expected to license, sell, or transfer to the partnership (directly or indirectly) intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer's current R
E expenditures, in the manner described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i) of this section, then the taxpayer's gross receipts in a SIC code category include only the taxpayer's share of any gross receipts in the SIC code category of the partnership. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the taxpayer's share of gross receipts is proportionate to the taxpayer's distributive share of the partnership's gross income in the product category. However, if the taxpayer is reasonably expected to license, sell, or transfer to the partnership (directly or indirectly) intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer current R
E expenditures, in the manner described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i) of this section, then the taxpayer's gross receipts in a SIC code category include the full amount of any gross receipts in the SIC code category of the partnership as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i) of this section.
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of the rules in this section.

Example 1: Controlled party and single product
—(i)
Facts.
X, a domestic corporation, is a manufacturer and distributor of small gasoline engines for lawnmowers. Gasoline engines are a product within the category, Engines and Turbines (SIC Industry Group 351). Y, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of X, also manufactures and sells these engines abroad. X owns no other foreign subsidiaries. During Year 1, X incurred R
E expenditures of $60,000x, which it deducts under section 174 as a current expense, to invent and patent a new and improved gasoline engine. All of the research and experimentation was performed in the United States. Also in Year 1, the domestic gross receipts of X from sales of gasoline engines total $500,000x and foreign gross receipts of Y from sales of gasoline engines total $300,000x. X provides technology for the manufacture of engines to Y through a license that requires
the payment of an arm's length royalty. Because X has licensed its intangible property to Y related to the SIC code, it is presumed to reasonably expect to license the intangible property that would be developed from the current research and experimentation. In Year 1, X's gross income is $210,000x, of which $140,000x is U.S. source income from domestic sales of gasoline engines, $40,000x is income included under section 951A, all of which relates to Y's foreign source income from sales of gasoline engines, $20,000x is foreign source royalties from Y, and $10,000x is U.S. source interest income. None of the foreign source royalties are allocable to passive category income of Y, and therefore, under §§ 1.904-4(d) and 1.904-5(c)(3), the foreign source royalties are general category income to X.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Allocation.
The R
E expenditures were incurred in connection with developing intangible property related to small gasoline engines and they are definitely related to X's items of gross intangible income related to the SIC code category 351, namely gross income from the sale of small gasoline engines in the United States and royalties received from subsidiary Y, a foreign manufacturer of gasoline engines. Accordingly, under paragraph (b) of this section, the R
E expenditures are allocable to the class of gross intangible income related to SIC code category 351, all of which is general category income of X. X's U.S. source interest income and income included under section 951A are not within this class of gross intangible income and, therefore, no portion of the R
E expenditures are allocated to the U.S. source interest income or foreign source income in the section 951A category.

Apportionment
—(

In general.
For purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, the statutory grouping of gross intangible income is foreign source general category income and the residual grouping of gross intangible income is U.S. source income.

)
Exclusive apportionment.
Under paragraph (c) of this section, because at least 50% of X's research and experimental activity was performed in the United States, 50% of the R
E expenditures, or $30,000x ($60,000x × 50%), is apportioned exclusively to the residual grouping of U.S. source gross intangible income. The remaining 50% of the R
E expenditures is then apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts from sales of small gasoline engines by X and Y that are related to the U.S. source sales income and foreign source royalty income, respectively.
(

)
Apportionment based on gross receipts.
After taking into account exclusive apportionment, X has $30,000x ($60,000x−$30,000x) of R
E expenditures that must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, Y's gross receipts within the SIC code are taken into account in apportioning X's R
E expenditures. Although X has gross intangible income of $140,000x from domestic sales and $20,000x in royalties from Y, X's R
E expenditures are apportioned to that gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of products by X and Y (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings. Therefore, under paragraphs (d)(1) and (4) of this section $11,250x ($30,000x × $300,000x/($500,000x + $300,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of X's gross intangible income attributable to its license of intangible property to Y, or foreign source general category income. No portion of the gross receipts by X or Y are disregarded under section 864(e)(3), regardless of whether the income related to those sales is eligible for a deduction under section 250(a)(1)(A). The remaining $18,750x ($30,000x × $500,000x/($500,000x + $300,000x)) is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, or U.S. source income.

Summary.
Accordingly, for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, $11,250x of X's R
E expenditures are apportioned to foreign source general category income, and $48,750x ($30,000x + $18,750x) of X's R
E expenditures are apportioned to U.S. source income.

Example 2: Controlled party and two products in same SIC code category
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that X also spends $30,000x in Year 1 for research on steam turbines, all of which is performed in the United States, and X has steam turbine gross receipts in the United States of $400,000x. X's foreign subsidiary Y neither manufactures nor sells steam turbines. The steam turbine research is in addition to the $60,000x in R
E expenditures incurred by X on gasoline engines for lawnmowers. X thus has $90,000x of R
E expenditures. X's gross income is $260,000x, of which $140,000x is U.S. source income from domestic sales of gasoline engines, $50,000x is U.S. source income from domestic sales of steam turbines, $40,000x is income included under section 951A all of which relates to foreign source income derived from Y's sales of gasoline engines, $20,000x is foreign source royalties from Y, and $10,000x is U.S. source interest income.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Allocation.
X's R
E expenditures generate gross intangible income from sales of small gasoline engines and steam turbines. Both of these products are in the same three digit SIC code category, Engines and Turbines (SIC Industry Group 351). Therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, X's R
E expenditures are definitely related to all items of gross intangible income attributable to SIC code category 351. These items of X's gross intangible income are gross income from the sale of small gasoline engines and steam turbines in the United States and royalties from foreign subsidiary Y, a foreign manufacturer and seller of small gasoline engines. X's U.S. source interest income and income included under section 951A is not within this class of gross intangible income and, therefore, no portion of X's R
E expenditures are allocated to the U.S. source interest income or income in the section 951A category.

Apportionment based on gross receipts.
After taking into account exclusive apportionment, X has $45,000x ($90,000x−$45,000x) of R
E expenditures that must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings. Although X has gross intangible income of $190,000x from domestic sales and $20,000x in royalties from Y, X's R
E expenditures are apportioned to that gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of products by X and Y (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings. Even though a portion of the R
E expenditures that must be apportioned are attributable to research performed with respect to steam turbines, and Y does not sell steam turbines, because Y is reasonably expected to license all intangible property related to SIC code category 351 from X, including intangible property related to steam turbines, under paragraphs (d)(1) and (4) of this section $11,250x ($45,000x × $300,000x/($500,000x + $400,000x + $300,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of gross intangible income, or foreign source general category income attributable to the royalty income to which the gross receipts of Y are related. The remaining $33,750x ($45,000x × ($500,000x + $400,000x)/($500,000x + $400,000x + $300,000x)) is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, or U.S. source gross income.

Facts
—(A)
Acquisitions and transfers by X.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
) except that, in Year 2, X and Y terminate the license for the manufacture of engines that was in place in Year 1 and enter into a cost sharing arrangement, in accordance with the provisions of § 1.482-7, to share the costs and risks of developing the intangible property related to the engines. Pursuant to the cost sharing arrangement, X has the exclusive rights to exploit the cost shared intangibles within the United States, and Y has the exclusive rights to exploit the cost shared intangibles outside the United States. X's and Y's shares of the reasonably anticipated benefits from the cost shared intangibles are 70% and 30%, respectively. In Year 2, Y makes a PCT Payment (as defined in § 1.482-7(b)(1)(ii)) of $50,000x that is characterized and sourced as a royalty for a license of small gasoline engine technology.
(B)
Gross receipts and R
E expenditures.
In Year 2, X and Y continue to sell gasoline engines, with gross receipts of $600,000x in the United States by X and $400,000x abroad by Y. X incurs intangible development costs associated with the cost shared intangibles of $100,000x in Year 2, which consist exclusively of research activities conducted in the United States. Y also makes a $30,000x CST Payment (as defined in § 1.482-7(b)(1)(i)) under the cost sharing arrangement. X is entitled to deduct $70,000x of its intangible development costs ($100,000x less the $30,000x CST Payment by Y) by reason of the second sentence under § 1.482-7(j)(3)(i) (relating to CST Payments).
(C)
Gross income of X.
In Year 2, X's gross income is $360,000x, of which $200,000x is U.S. source income from domestic sales of small gasoline engines, $50,000x is foreign source general category income attributable to the PCT Payment, $100,000x is income included under section 951A (all of which relates to foreign source income derived from engine sales by Y), and $10,000x is U.S. source interest income.

Allocation.
The $70,000x of R
E expenditures incurred in Year 2 by X in connection with small gasoline engines are definitely related to the items of gross intangible income related to the SIC code category, namely gross income from the sale of small gasoline engines in the United States and PCT Payments from Y. Accordingly, under paragraph (a) of this section, the R
E expenditures are allocable to this class of gross intangible income. X's U.S. source interest income and income included under section 951A are not within this class of gross intangible income and, therefore, no portion of X's R

Although X has gross intangible income of $200,000x from domestic sales and $50,000x as a PCT Payment from Y, X's R
E expenditures are apportioned to its gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of products by X (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings. Under paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, because of the cost sharing arrangement, Y's gross receipts from sales are not taken into account in apportioning X's R
E expenditures that are intangible development costs
with respect to the cost sharing arrangement. Because all of the gross receipts from sales that are taken into account under paragraph (d)(1) of this section relate to gross intangible income that is included in the residual grouping, $35,000x is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, or U.S. source income.

Facts
—(A)
X's R
E expenditures.
X, a domestic corporation, is engaged in continuous research and experimentation to improve the quality of the products that it manufactures and sells, which are floodlights, flashlights, fuse boxes, and solderless connectors. All of these products are in the same three digit SIC code category, Electric Lighting and Wiring Equipment (SIC Industry Group 364). X incurs $100,000x of R
E expenditures in Year 1 that is performed exclusively in the United States. As a result of this research activity, X acquires patents that it uses in its own manufacturing activity.
(B)
License to Y and Z.
In Year 1, X licenses its floodlight patent to Y and Z, uncontrolled parties, for use in their own territories, Countries Y and Z, respectively. Y pays X a royalty of $3,000x plus $0.20x for each unit sold. Gross receipts from sales of floodlights by Y for the taxable year are $135,000x (30,000 units at $4.50x per unit), and the royalty is $9,000x ($3,000x + $0.20x/unit × 30,000 units). Y has sales of other products of $500,000x. Z pays X a royalty of $3,000x plus $0.30x for each unit sold. Z manufactures 30,000 floodlights in the taxable year, and the royalty is $12,000x ($3,000x + $0.30x/unit × 30,000 units). The dollar value of Z's gross receipts from floodlight sales is not known to X because, in this case, the floodlights are not sold separately by Z but are instead used as a component in Z's manufacture of lighting equipment for theaters. However, a reasonable estimate of Z's gross receipts attributable to the floodlights, based on the principles of section 482, is $120,000x. The gross receipts from sales of all Z's products, including the lighting equipment for theaters, are $1,000,000x. Because X has licensed its intangible property to Y and Z related to the SIC code, it is presumed to reasonably expect to license the intangible property that would be developed from the current research and experimentation.
(C)
X's gross receipts and gross income.
X's gross receipts from sales of floodlights for the taxable year are $500,000x and its sales of its other products (flashlights, fuse boxes, and solderless connectors) are $400,000x. X has gross income of $500,000x, consisting of U.S. source gross income from domestic sales of floodlights, flashlights, fuse boxes, and solderless connectors of $479,000x, and foreign source gross income from royalties of $9,000x and $12,000x from foreign corporations Y and Z, respectively. The royalty income is general category income to X under § 1.904-4(b)(2)(ii).

X's R
E expenditures are definitely related to all of the gross intangible income from the products that it produces, which are floodlights, flashlights, fuse boxes, and solderless connectors. All of these products are in SIC code category 364. Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this section, X's R
E expenditures are definitely related to the class of gross intangible income related to SIC code category 364 and to all items of gross intangible income attributable to the class.

Apportionment based on gross receipts.
After taking into account exclusive apportionment, X has $50,000x ($100,000x−$50,000x) of R
E expenditures that must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, gross receipts from sales of Y and Z are taken into account in apportioning X's R
E expenditures. Although X has gross intangible income of $479,000x from domestic sales and $21,000x in royalties from Y and Z, X's R
E expenditures are apportioned to its gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of products by X, Y and Z (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings. In addition, under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section only the portion of Z's gross receipts that are attributable to the floodlights that incorporate the intangible property licensed from X, rather than Z's total gross receipts, are used for purposes of apportionment. All of X's gross receipts from sales in the entire SIC code category are included for purposes of apportionment on the basis of gross intangible income attributable to those sales. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $11,039x ($50,000x × ($135,000x + $120,000x)/($900,000x + $135,000x + $120,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of gross intangible income, or foreign source general category income. The remaining $38,961x ($50,000x × $900,000x/($900,000x + $135,000x + $120,000x)) is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, or U.S. source income.

Example 5: Uncontrolled party and sublicense
—(i)
Facts.
X, a domestic corporation, is a cloud storage service provider. Cloud storage services are a service within the category, Computer Programming, Data Processing, and other Computer Related Services (SIC Industry Group 737). During Year 1, X incurs R
E expenditures of $50,000x to invent and copyright new storage monitoring and management software. All of the research and experimentation is performed in the United States. X uses this software in its own business to provide services to customers. X also licenses a version of the software that can be used by other businesses that provide cloud storage services. X licenses the software to uncontrolled party U, which sub-licenses the software to other businesses that provide cloud storage services to customers. U does not use the software except to sublicense it. As a part of the licensing agreement with U, U and its sub-licensees are only permitted to use the software in certain countries outside of the United States. Under the contract with U, U pays X a royalty of 50% on the amount it receives from its sub-licensees that use the software to provide services to customers. Because X has licensed its intangible property to U related to the SIC code and U has sublicensed it to other businesses, it is presumed that X is reasonably expected to license the intangible property that would be developed from its current research and experimentation to U and that U would sublicense it to other businesses. In Year 1, X earns $300,000x of gross receipts from providing cloud storage services within the United States. Further, in Year 1 U receives $10,000x of royalty income from its sub-licensees and pays a royalty of $5,000x to X. Thus, X earns $300,000x of U.S. source general category gross income and also earns $5,000x of foreign source general category royalty income from licensing its software to U for use outside of the United States.

For purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, the statutory grouping of gross intangible income is foreign source general category income, and the residual grouping of gross intangible income is U.S. source income.

Exclusive apportionment.
Under paragraph (c) of this section, because at least 50% of X's research and experimental activity was performed in the United States, 50% of the R
E expenditures, or $25,000x ($50,000x × 50%), is apportioned exclusively to the residual grouping of U.S. source gross intangible income.

Apportionment based on gross receipts
—(
i
)
In general.
After taking into account exclusive apportionment, X has $25,000x ($50,000x−$25,000x) of R
E expenditures that must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings. Because X has licensed its intangible property related to the SIC code to U and U has licensed it to the sub-licensees, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, gross receipts from sales of U's sublicensees are taken into account in apportioning X's R
E expenditures. Although X has gross intangible income of $300,000x from domestic sales of services and $5,000x in royalties from U, X's R
E expenditures are apportioned to its gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of services by X and U's sub-licensees (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings.
(

)
Determination of U's sub-licensee's gross receipts.
Under paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section, X can make a reasonable estimate of the gross receipts of U's sub-licensees from services incorporating the intangible property licensed by X by estimating, after an appropriate economic analysis, that U would charge a royalty of 5% of the sub-licensee's sales. U received a royalty of $10,000x from the sub-licensees. X then determines U's sub-licensees' foreign sales by dividing the total royalty payments received by U by the royalty estimated rate ($10,000x/.05 = $200,000x).

Results of apportionment based on gross receipts.
Therefore, under paragraphs (d)(1) and (3) of this section, $10,000x ($25,000x × $200,000x/($300,000x + $200,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of gross intangible income, or foreign source general category income. The remaining $15,000x ($25,000x × $300,000x/($300,000x + $200,000x)) is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, or U.S. source income.

)
Summary.
Accordingly, for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, $10,000x of X's R
E expenditures are apportioned to foreign source general category income and $40,000x ($25,000x + $15,000x) of X's R
E expenditures are apportioned to U.S. source income.

Example 6: Foreign branch
—(i)
Facts
—(A)
Overview for X.
X, a domestic corporation, owns FDE, a disregarded entity that is a foreign branch within the meaning of § 1.904-4(f)(3)(vii). FDE conducts activities solely in Country Y. FDE's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. X is a manufacturer and distributor of small gasoline engines for lawnmowers in the United States. Gasoline engines are a product within the category, Engines and Turbines (SIC Industry Group 351). FDE also manufactures and distributes small gasoline engines but only in Country Y. During Year 1, X incurred R
E expenditures of $60,000x, which it deducts under section 174 as a current expense, to invent and patent a new and improved gasoline engine. All of the research and experimentation was performed in the United States. Also in Year 1, the domestic gross receipts of X from gasoline engines total $500,000x. X provides technology for the manufacture of engines to FDE through a license. FDE compensates X for the technology with an arm's length royalty payment of $10,000x, which is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes.
(B)
Overview for FDE.
FDE accrues and records on its books and records $100,000x of gross income from sales of gasoline engines to unrelated persons. FDE's gross income is non-passive category income and is foreign source income. In Year 1, the foreign gross receipts of FDE from sales of gasoline engines total $300,000x. The disregarded royalty payment from FDE to X is not
recorded on FDE's separate books and records (as adjusted to conform to Federal income tax principles) within the meaning of paragraph § 1.904-4(f)(2)(i) because it is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. However, the $10,000x disregarded royalty payment would be allocable to foreign source gross income attributable to FDE under § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi)(B)(
1
)(
ii
). Therefore, under § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi)(A) the amount of foreign source gross income attributable to FDE is adjusted downwards and the amount of foreign source gross income attributable to X is adjusted upward to take the $10,000x disregarded royalty payment into account.
(C)
Assignment of X's gross income to separate categories.
In Year 1, X has U.S. source general category gross income of $140,000x from domestic sales of gasoline engines. After application of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi)(A) to the disregarded payment made by FDE, X has $10,000x of foreign source general category gross income and X also has $90,000x of foreign source foreign branch category gross income.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Allocation.
The R
E expenditures were incurred in connection with developing intangible property related to small gasoline engines and are definitely related to the items of gross intangible income related to the SIC code category 351, namely gross income from the sale of small gasoline engines in both the United States and Country Y.
(B)
Apportionment
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, the statutory groupings of gross intangible income are foreign source general category income and foreign source foreign branch category income, and the residual grouping of gross intangible income is U.S. source income.
(
2
)
Exclusive apportionment.
Under paragraph (c) of this section, because at least 50% of X's research and experimental activity was performed in the United States, 50% of the R
E expenditures, or $30,000 ($60,000x × 50%), is apportioned exclusively to the residual grouping of U.S. source gross intangible income. The remaining 50% of the R
E expenditures is then apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts from sales of small gasoline engines that are related to U.S. source income, foreign source general category income, and foreign source foreign branch category income.
(

)
Apportionment based on gross receipts.
After taking into account exclusive apportionment, X has $30,000x ($60,000x−$30,000x) of R
E expenditures that must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings. Because X's gross intangible income is not described in paragraph (d)(3) or (4) of this section (that is, there is no gross intangible income related to sales, leases or services from controlled or uncontrolled parties that are incorporating intangible property that was licensed, sold, or transferred to controlled or uncontrolled parties), the groupings to which the taxpayer's gross receipts and gross intangible income are assigned is the same. However, because the assignment of X's gross income to the foreign branch and general categories is made by taking into account disregarded payments under § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi), the assignment of gross receipts between the general category and foreign branch category must be determined by making similar adjustments to X's gross receipts under the principles of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi). See paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section. Foreign gross receipts of FDE from gasoline engines total $300,000x. However, those gross receipts are adjusted under the principles of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi) for purposes of apportioning the remaining R
E expenditures by reducing the gross receipts initially assigned to the foreign branch category by an amount equal to the ratio of the royalty income to FDE's gross income that is initially assigned to the foreign branch category. Accordingly, since the disregarded royalty payment of $10,000x caused an adjustment equal to 10% of FDE's initial gross income of $100,000x, 10% of the gross receipts or $30,000x (10% × $300,000x) are similarly assigned to the grouping of foreign source general category income, and the remaining $270,000x of gross receipts are assigned to the grouping of foreign source foreign branch category income. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $1,125x ($30,000x ×
$30,000x/($500,000x + $270,000x + $30,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of X's gross intangible income attributable to foreign source general category income. $10,125x ($30,000x × $270,000x/($500,000x + $270,000x + $30,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of X's foreign source foreign branch category income. The remaining $18,750x ($30,000x × $500,000x/($500,000x + $270,000x + $30,000x)) is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income or U.S. source income.

Example 7: Indirectly derived gross intangible income
—(i)
Facts.
P, a domestic corporation, develops and publishes an internet website that persons use (referred to as “users” and collectively referred to as “user base”) without a fee. P incurs R
E expenditures to update software code and write new software code to maintain the website and develop new products that are incorporated into the website. P's activities consist of services that fall within SIC code category 737 (computer programming, data processing, and other computer related services). P sells space on its website for businesses to advertise to its user base in exchange for a fee. P's technology allows it to collect data on users and to use that data to effectively target advertisements. P does not grant rights to the technology or other intangible property to the businesses advertising on its website. In Year 1, P incurs R
E expenditures of $60,000x, which it deducts under section 174. All the research and experimentation is performed in the United States. Also in Year 1, P earns gross receipts of $200,000x from the sale of advertisements, all of which gives rise to U.S. source gross income.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Allocation.
The R
E expenditures were incurred in connection with developing intangible property used for P's website. Accordingly, they are definitely related and allocable to gross intangible income derived directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) from that intangible property. Because P's advertising sales are dependent on the users attracted to its website, P's gross income from advertising is indirectly derived from intangible property and is included in gross intangible income. Accordingly, under paragraph (b) of this section, the R
E expenditures are allocable to the class of gross intangible income related to SIC code category 737, which consists of U.S. source income.
(B)
Apportionment.
Because all gross receipts from services that the intangible property directly or indirectly benefits result in U.S. source income, no apportionment is required.
(h)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2019. However, taxpayers may choose to apply this section to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and before January 1, 2020, provided they apply this section in its entirety and for any subsequent year beginning before January 1, 2020.

§ 1.861-18
Classification of, and source of gross income from, digital content transactions.
(a)
General
—(1)
Scope.
This section provides rules for classifying digital content transactions (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) for purposes of subchapter N of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, sections 59A, 245A, 250, 267A, 367, 404A, 482, 679, 1059A, chapters 3 and 4, sections 842 and 845 (to the extent involving a foreign person), and transfers to foreign trusts not covered by section 679.
(2)
Digital content
—(i)
Digital content defined.
For purposes of this section, digital content means a computer program or any other content, such as books, movies, and music, in digital format that is—
(A) Protected by copyright law; or
(B) Not protected by copyright law solely—
(
1
) Due to the passage of time; or
(
2
) Because the creator dedicated the content to the public domain.
(ii)
Computer program defined.
For purposes of this section, a computer program is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result and includes any media, user manuals, documentation, data base, or similar item if the media, user manuals, documentation, data
base, or other similar item is incidental to the operation of the computer program.
(b)
Categories of transactions
—(1)
General.
A transaction that constitutes a transfer of digital content, or the provision of services or of know-how with respect to digital content (each a digital content transaction), is treated as being solely one of the following—
(i) A transfer of a copyright right in the digital content;
(ii) A transfer of a copy of the digital content (a copyrighted article);
(iii) The provision of services for the development or modification of the digital content; or
(iv) The provision of know-how relating to development of digital content.
(2)
Transaction with multiple elements.
Taking into account the overall transaction and the surrounding facts and circumstances, a transaction that has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a digital content transaction if considered separately, is classified in its entirety as a digital content transaction under one of the categories described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the predominant character of the transaction is described in one of the categories in that paragraph.
(3)
Determination of predominant character
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section and § 1.861-19(c)(2), the predominant character of a transaction is determined by ascertaining the primary benefit or value received by the customer in the transaction.
(ii)
Special rule.
If the primary benefit or value received by the customer in the transaction is not reasonably ascertainable, the predominant character of a transaction is instead determined by ascertaining the primary benefit or value received by a typical customer in a substantially similar transaction as determined under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.
(A) The primary benefit or value received by a typical customer is determined by data on how a typical customer uses or accesses the digital content. See paragraph (h)(17) of this section (
Example 17
).
(B) If data described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section is not available, then the predominant character of a transaction subject to the special rule in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section is determined by examining other factors that are indicative of the primary benefit or value received by a typical customer, including the following—
(
1
) How the transferor or provider markets the transaction;
(
2
) The relative development costs to the transferor or provider of each element of the transaction; and
(
3
) The relative price paid in an uncontrolled transaction for one or more elements compared to the total contract price of the transaction in question.
(iii)
Identification and development of data.
A transferor or provider must use reasonable efforts to identify the data specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii)(A) of this section, or if necessary, to apply the factors relevant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. However, a transferor or provider is not required to develop any of the data specified in those paragraphs that it does not develop in the course of business.
(c)
Transfers involving copyright rights and copyrighted articles
—(1)
Transfers involving transfers of copyright rights.
A digital content transaction involves a transfer of a copyright right if, as a result of the transaction, a person acquires one or more of the rights described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(2)
Copyright rights.
The copyright rights referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are as follows—
(i) The right to make copies of the digital content for purposes of distribution to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease or lending;
(ii) The right to prepare derivative digital content based upon the digital content;
(iii) The right to make a public performance of digital content, other than a right to publicly perform digital content for the purpose of advertising the sale of the digital content performed; or
(iv) The right to publicly display digital content, other than a right to publicly display digital content for the
purpose of advertising the sale of the digital content displayed.
(3)
Copyrighted articles.
A copyrighted article includes a copy of digital content from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. The copy of the digital content may be fixed in any medium.
(d)
Provision of services.
The determination of whether a transaction involving newly developed or modified digital content involves the provision of services described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is based on all the facts and circumstances of the transaction, including, as appropriate, the intent of the parties (as evidenced by their agreement and conduct) as to which party is to own the copyright rights in the digital content and how the risks of loss are allocated between the parties. See paragraph (h)(15) of this section (
Example 15
).
(e)
Provision of know-how.
The provision of information with respect to digital content involves the provision of know-how for purposes of this section only if the information is—
(1) Information relating to the development of digital content;
(2) Furnished under conditions preventing unauthorized disclosure, specifically contracted for between the parties; and
(3) Considered property subject to trade secret protection.
(f)
Further classification of transfers involving copyright rights and copyrighted articles
—(1)
Transfers of copyright rights.
The determination of whether a transfer of a copyright right is a sale or exchange of property is made on the basis of whether, taking into account all facts and circumstances, there has been a transfer of all substantial rights in the copyright. A transfer of a copyright right that does not constitute a sale or exchange because not all substantial rights have been transferred will be classified as a license. For this purpose, the principles of sections 1222 and 1235 apply. Income derived from the sale or exchange of a copyright right will be sourced under section 865(a), (c), (d), (e), or (h), as appropriate. Income derived from the licensing of a copyright right will be sourced under section 861(a)(4) or 862(a)(4), as appropriate.
(2)
Transfers of copyrighted articles
—(i)
Classification.
The determination of whether a transfer of a copyrighted article is a sale or exchange is made on the basis of whether, taking into account all facts and circumstances, the benefits and burdens of ownership have been transferred. A transfer of a copyrighted article that does not constitute a sale or exchange because insufficient benefits and burdens of ownership of the copyrighted article have been transferred, such that a person other than the transferee is properly treated as the owner of the copyrighted article, will be classified as a lease.
(ii)
Source.
Income from transactions that are classified as sales or exchanges of copyrighted articles will be sourced under section 861(a)(6), 862(a)(6), 863, or 865(a), (b), (c), or (e), as appropriate. When a copyrighted article is sold and transferred through an electronic medium, the sale is deemed to have occurred at the location of the billing address of the purchaser for purposes of § 1.861-7(c). However, in any case in which the sales transaction is arranged in a particular manner for a principal purpose of tax avoidance, the foregoing rules will not be applied. In such a case, all of the facts and circumstances relevant to the transaction, such as the place where the copyrighted article will be used, the place where negotiations and the execution of the agreement occurred, and the terms of the agreement, will be considered, and the sale will be treated as having occurred where the substance of the sale occurred. Income derived from leasing a copyrighted article will be sourced under section 861(a)(4) or 862(a)(4), as appropriate.
(3)
Special circumstances of digital content.
In connection with determinations under this paragraph (f), consideration must be given as appropriate to the special characteristics of digital content in transactions that take advantage of these characteristics (such as the ability to make perfect copies at minimal cost). For example, a transaction in which a person acquires a copy of digital content on a disk subject to a requirement that the disk be destroyed after a specified period is
generally the equivalent of a transaction subject to a requirement that the disk be returned after such period. Similarly, a transaction in which the digital content deactivates itself after a specified period is generally the equivalent of a transaction subject to a requirement that the disk be returned after a specified period.
(g)
Rules of operation
—(1)
Term applied to transaction by parties.
Neither the form adopted by the parties to a transaction, nor the classification of the transaction under copyright law, shall be determinative. Therefore, for example, if there is a transfer of a computer program on a single disk for a one-time payment with restrictions on transfer and reverse engineering, which the parties characterize as a license (including, but not limited to, agreements commonly referred to as shrink-wrap licenses), application of the rules of paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section may nevertheless result in the transaction being classified as the sale of a copyrighted article.
(2)
Means of transfer not to be taken into account.
The rules of this section shall be applied irrespective of the physical or electronic or other medium used to effectuate a digital content transaction.
(3)
To the public
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a transferee of digital content shall not be considered to have the right to distribute copies of the digital content to the public if it is permitted to distribute copies of the digital content to only either a related person, or to identified persons who may be identified by either name or by legal relationship to the original transferee. For purposes of this subparagraph, a related person is a person who bears a relationship to the transferee specified in section 267(b)(3), (10), (11), or (12), or section 707(b)(1)(B). In applying section 267(b), 267(f), 707(b)(1)(B), or 1563(a), “10 percent” shall be substituted for “50 percent.”
(ii)
Use by individuals.
The number of employees of a transferee of digital content who are permitted to use the digital content in connection with their employment is not relevant for purposes of this paragraph (g)(3). In addition, the number of individuals with a contractual agreement to provide services to the transferee of digital content who are permitted to use the digital content in connection with the performance of those services is not relevant for purposes of this paragraph (g)(3).
(h)
Examples.
The examples in this paragraph (h) illustrate the provisions of this section. Unless otherwise specified, assume that Corp A is a domestic corporation, the digital content described in each example does not contain any online functionality, and all facts in each example occur as part of a single transaction.
(1)
Example 1: Sale of a computer program on a disk
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A owns the copyright in a computer program, Program X. It copies Program X onto disks. The disks are placed in boxes covered with a wrapper on which is printed what is generally referred to as a shrink-wrap license. The license is stated to be perpetual. Under the license no reverse engineering, decompilation, or disassembly of the computer program is permitted. The transferee receives, first, the right to use the program on two of its own computers (for example, a laptop and a desktop) provided that only one copy is in use at any one time, and second, the right to make one copy of the program on each machine as an essential step in the utilization of the program. The transferee is permitted by the shrink-wrap license to sell the copy so long as it destroys any other copies it has made and imposes the same terms and conditions of the license on the purchaser of its copy. These disks are made available for sale to the general public in Country Z. In return for valuable consideration, P, a Country Z resident, receives one such disk.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the transfer of a disk containing a copy of Program X from Corp A to P is a digital content transaction with one element, which is the transfer of a copy of Program X. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the label license is not determinative.
(B) Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, P is properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, there has been a sale of a copyrighted article rather than the grant of a lease.
(2)
Example 2: Sale of a computer program via download from the internet
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (h)(1) of this section (
Example 1
), except that instead of selling disks, Corp A decides to make Program X available, for a fee, on a World Wide Web home page on the internet. P, the Country Z resident, in return for payment made to Corp A, downloads Program X (via modem) onto the hard drive of his computer. As part of the electronic communication, P signifies his assent to a license agreement with terms identical to those in
Example 1,
except that in this case P may make a back-up copy of the program on to a disk.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the digital transfer of a copy of Program X from Corp A to P is a digital content transaction with one element, which is the transfer of a copy of Program X. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Although P did not buy a physical copy of the disk with the program on it, paragraph (g)(2) of this section provides that the means of transferring the program is irrelevant.
(B) As in paragraph (h)(1) of this section (
Example 1
), P is properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, there has been a sale of a copyrighted article rather than the grant of a lease.
(3)
Example 3: Lease of a computer program with requirement to return disk
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (h)(1) of this section (
Example 1
), except that Corp A only allows P, the Country Z resident, to use Program X for one week. At the end of that week, P must return the disk with Program X on it to Corp A. P must also destroy any copies made of Program X. If P wishes to use Program X for a further period he must enter into a new agreement to use the program for an additional charge.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the transfer of a disk with a copy of Program X from Corp A to P is a digital content transaction with one element, which is the transfer of a copy of Program X. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(B) Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, P is not properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, there has been a lease of a copyrighted article rather than a sale. Taking into account the special characteristics of digital content as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the result would be the same if P were required to destroy the disk at the end of the one-week period instead of returning it since Corp A can make additional copies of the program at minimal cost.
(4)
Example 4: Lease of a computer program with electronic lock
—(i)
Facts.
* * *
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the digital transfer of a copy of Program X from Corp A to P is a digital content transaction with one element, which is the transfer of a copy of Program X. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(B) As in paragraph (h)(3) of this section (
Example 3
), P is not properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, there has been a lease of a copyrighted article rather than a sale. While P does retain Program X on its computer at the end of the one-week period, as a legal matter P no longer has the right to use the program (without further payment) and, indeed, cannot use the program without the electronic key. Functionally, Program X is no longer on the hard drive of P's computer. Instead, the hard drive contains only a series of numbers which no longer perform the function of Program X. Although in
Example 3,
P was required to physically return the disk, taking into account the special characteristics of digital
content as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the result in this paragraph (h)(4) (
Example 4
) is the same as in
Example 3.
(5)
Example 5: Sale of copyright rights to a computer program
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A transfers a disk containing Program X to Corp B, a Country Z corporation, and grants Corp B an exclusive license for the remaining term of the copyright to copy and distribute an unlimited number of copies of Program X in the geographic area of Country Z, prepare derivative works based upon Program X, make public performances of Program X, and publicly display Program X. Corp B will pay Corp A a royalty of $y a year for three years, which is the expected period during which Program X will have commercially exploitable value (a period shorter than the copyright term). Corp A has ascertained that the primary benefit or value from the transaction to Corp B is derived from the four legal rights obtained in Program X from Corp A and not from the receipt of a copy of Program X. The transfer of a copy of Program X is merely the means by which Corp A provides Corp B access to Program X in order to exercise its copyright rights.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The transaction between Corp A and Corp B has multiple elements. One element is the transfer of a disk with a copy of Program X, which would be a digital content transaction described under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (transfer of a copyrighted article) if considered separately. Another element is the grant of the right to make an unlimited number of copies of Program X and distribute those copies to the public, the right to prepare derivative works based upon Program X, the right to make public performances of Program X, and the right to publicly display Program X, which would be described under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (c)(2) of this section (transfer of a copyright right) if considered separately.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a digital content transaction if considered separately, paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified within a single category under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if its predominant character is described in that paragraph. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer, if it is reasonably ascertainable. The predominant character of this transaction is therefore the transfer of copyright rights because the primary benefit or value received by Corp B from the transaction is the ability to exercise the copyright rights described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Therefore, this transaction is classified solely as a transfer of copyright rights described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(C) Applying the all substantial rights test under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, Corp A will be treated as having sold copyright rights to Corp B. Corp B has acquired all of the copyright rights in Program X, has received the right to use them exclusively within Country Z, and has received the rights for the remaining life of the copyright in Program X. The fact the payments cease before the copyright term expires is not controlling. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the fact that the agreement is labelled a license is not controlling nor is the fact that Corp A receives a sum labelled a royalty. (The result in this case would be the same if the copy of Program X to be used for the purposes of reproduction were transmitted electronically to Corp B, as a result of the application of the rule of paragraph (g)(2) of this section.)

Example 6: License of copyright right to make copies of a computer program and distribute to the public
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A transfers a disk containing Program X to Corp B, a Country Z corporation, and grants Corp B the non-exclusive right to reproduce and distribute for sale to the public an unlimited number of disks containing Program X at its factory in Country Z in return for a payment related to the number of disks copied and sold. The term of the agreement is two years, which is less than the remaining life of the copyright. Corp A has ascertained that the primary benefit or value from the transaction to Corp B is derived
from the right to reproduce and distribute Program X and not from the receipt of a copy of Program X. The transfer of a copy of Program X is merely the means by which Corp A provides Corp B access to Program X in order to exercise its copyright rights.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The transaction between Corp A and Corp B has multiple elements. One element is the transfer of a disk with a copy of Program X, which would be described under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (transfer of a copyrighted article) if considered separately. Another element is the grant of the right to reproduce and distribute for sale to the public an unlimited number of disks containing Program X, which would be described under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (c)(2)(i) of this section (transfer of a copyright right) if considered separately.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a digital content transaction if considered separately, paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified within a single category under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if its predominant character is described in that paragraph. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer, if it is reasonably ascertainable. The predominant character of this transaction is therefore the transfer of a copyright right because the primary benefit or value received by Corp B is the right to reproduce and distribute for sale to the public copies of Program X. Therefore, this transaction is classified solely as a transfer of copyright rights described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(C) Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, there has been a license of Program X to Corp B. Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, there has not been a transfer of all substantial rights in the copyright to Program X because Corp A has the right to enter into other licenses with respect to the copyright of Program X, including licenses in Country Z (or even to sell that copyright, subject to Corp B's interest). Corp B has acquired no right itself to license the copyright rights in Program X. Finally, the term of the license is for less than the remaining life of the copyright in Program X.

Example 7: Sale of disks containing copies of a computer program to a distributor
—(i)
Facts.
Corp C, a distributor, enters into an agreement with Corp A to purchase as many copies of Program X on disk as it may from time-to-time request. Corp C will then sell these disks to retailers. The disks are shipped in boxes covered by shrink-wrap licenses (identical to the license described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section (
Example 1
)).
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the transfers of disks with copies of Program X from Corp A to Corp C are digital content transactions with one element, which is the transfer of copies of Program X. Therefore, the transactions are classified solely as the transfer of copyrighted articles under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The use of the term license is not dispositive under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(B) Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, Corp C is properly treated as the owner of copyrighted articles. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, there has been a sale of copyrighted articles.
(8)
Example 8: License to a computer manufacturer of copyright rights to make and load copies of a computer program onto the hard drive of computers
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A transfers a disk containing Program X to Corp D, a foreign corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of personal computers in Country Z. Corp A grants Corp D the non-exclusive right to copy Program X onto the hard drive of an unlimited number of computers, which Corp D manufactures, and to distribute those copies (on the hard drive) to the public. The term of the agreement is two years, which is less than the remaining life of the copyright in Program X. Corp D pays Corp A an amount based on the number of copies of Program X it loads on to computers. Corp A has ascertained that the primary benefit or value from the transaction to Corp D is the ability to copy and distribute Program X onto computers manufactured by Corp D, not from the receipt of a copy of Program X. The transfer of a
copy of Program X is merely the means by which Corp A provides Corp D access to Program X in order to exercise its right to make and distribute copies.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The transaction between Corp A and Corp D has multiple elements. One element is the transfer of a disk with a copy of Program X, which would be described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (transfer of a copyrighted article) if considered separately. Another element is the grant of the non-exclusive right to copy Program X onto the hard drive of an unlimited number of computers and distribute those copies (on the hard drive) to the public, which would be described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (c)(2)(i) of this section (transfer of a copyright right) if considered separately.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a digital content transaction if considered separately, paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified within a single category under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if its predominant character is described in that paragraph. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer, if it is reasonably ascertainable. The predominant character of this transaction is therefore the transfer of copyright rights because the primary benefit or value received by Corp D is the right to copy Program X onto the hard drive of an unlimited number of computers and sell those copies (on the hard drive) to the public. Therefore, this transaction is classified solely as a transfer of copyright rights described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(C) Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, there has been a license of Program X to Corp D. Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, there has not been a transfer of all substantial rights in the copyright to Program X because Corp A has the right to enter into other licenses with respect to the copyright of Program X, including licenses in Country Z (or even to sell that copyright, subject to Corp D's interest). Corp D has acquired no right itself to license the copyright rights in Program X. Finally, the term of the license is for less than the remaining life of the copyright in Program X. The result would be the same if Corp D included with the computers it sells a copy of Program X on a disk.
(9)
Example 9: Sale of disks containing a copy of computer program to a computer manufacturer
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (h)(8) of this section (
Example 8
), except that Corp D, the Country Z corporation, receives physical disks. The disks are shipped in boxes covered by shrink-wrap licenses (identical to the licenses described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section (
Example 1
)). The terms of these licenses do not permit Corp D to make additional copies of Program X. Corp D uses each individual disk only once to load a single copy of Program X onto each separate computer. Corp D transfers the disk with the computer when it is sold.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the transfers of disks with copies of Program X from Corp A to Corp D are digital content transactions with one element, which is the transfer of copies of Program X. Therefore, the transaction is classified solely as the transfer of copyrighted articles under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Corp D acquires the disks without the right to reproduce and distribute publicly further copies of Program X.
(B) Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, Corp D is properly treated as the owner of copyrighted articles. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the transaction is classified as the sale of a copyrighted article. The result would be the same if Corp D used a single physical disk to copy Program X onto each computer, and transferred an unopened box containing Program X with each computer, if Corp D were not permitted to copy Program X onto more computers than the number of individual copies purchased.
(10)
Example 10: Sale of a computer program with right to load onto multiple employee workstations
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A transfers a disk containing Program X to Corp E and grants Corp E the right to load Program X onto 50 individual workstations for use only by Corp E employees at one location in return for
a one-time per-user fee (generally referred to as a site license or enterprise license). If additional workstations are subsequently introduced, Program X may be loaded onto those machines for additional one-time per-user fees. The license which grants the rights to operate Program X on 50 workstations also prohibits Corp E from selling the disk (or any of the 50 copies) or reverse engineering the program. The term of the license is stated to be perpetual.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) It must be determined whether the transfer from Corp A to Corp E of a disk containing a copy of Program X and the right to load Program X onto 50 individual workstations is a transaction with multiple elements. There is at least one element, which is the transfer of a disk containing a copy of Program X, which either is a digital content transaction under paragraph (b)(1) of this section or would be a digital content transaction if considered separately. If there is no additional element, then the transaction is classified as a transfer of a copyrighted article pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. If there is a second element, then paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies and the transaction is classified within a single category under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if its predominant character is described in that paragraph. The grant of a right to copy, unaccompanied by the right to distribute those copies to the public, is not the transfer of a copyright right described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Therefore, there is no second element in this transaction and it is classified solely as the transfer of copyrighted articles (50 copies of Program X).
(B) Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, Corp E is properly treated as the owner of copyrighted articles. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, there has been a sale of copyrighted articles rather than the grant of a lease. Notwithstanding the restriction on sale, other factors such as, for example, the risk of loss and the right to use the copies in perpetuity outweigh, in this case, the restrictions placed on the right of alienation.
(C) The result would be the same if Corp E were permitted to copy Program X onto an unlimited number of workstations used by employees of either Corp E or other persons that had a relationship to Corp E specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
(11)
Example 11: Sale of a computer program with right to make available to multiple employees via local area network
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (h)(10) of this section (
Example 10
), except that Corp E, the Country Z corporation, acquires the right to make Program X available to workstation users who are Corp E employees by way of a local area network (LAN). The number of users that can use Program X on the LAN at any one time is limited to 50. Corp E pays a one-time fee for the right to have up to 50 employees use the program at the same time.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section the mode of utilization is irrelevant. Therefore, as in paragraph (h)(10) of this section (
Example 10
), this is a digital content transaction with a single element that is classified as the transfer of a copyrighted article pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Under the benefits and burdens test of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, this transaction is a sale of copyrighted articles. The result would be the same if an unlimited number of Corp E employees were permitted to use Program X on the LAN or if Corp E were permitted to copy Program X onto LANs maintained by persons that had a relationship to Corp E specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
(12)
Example 12: Lease of a computer program with right to receive upgrades and technical support services
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(11) of this section (
Example 11
), except that instead of paying a one-time fee, Corp E pays a monthly fee to Corp A calculated with reference to the permitted maximum number of users (which can be changed) and the computing power of Corp E's server. In return for this monthly fee, Corp E receives the right to receive upgrades of Program X when they become available. The agreement may be terminated by either party at the end of any month. When the disk containing the
upgrade is received, Corp E must return the disk containing the earlier version of Program X to Corp A. If the contract is terminated, Corp E must delete (or otherwise destroy) all copies made of the current version of Program X. The agreement also requires Corp A to provide technical support in the form of troubleshooting and configuration assistance to Corp E, but the agreement does not allocate the monthly fee between the right to use Program X, the right to receive upgrades of Program X, and the technical support services. The amount of technical support that Corp A will provide to Corp E is not foreseeable when the contract is entered into but is expected to be minimal. Corp A has ascertained that the primary benefit or value to Corp E from the transaction is the right to use Program X on the LAN (without the ability to exercise any of the rights described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section), not the receipt of technical support services with respect to Program X.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The transaction between Corp A and Corp E has multiple elements. One element is the transfer of a disk with a copy of Program X, which would be described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (transfer of a copyrighted article) if considered separately. Another element is the provision of technical support services, which are not services for the development or modification of Program X described in paragraph (d) of this section because Corp E has received no copyright rights with respect to Program X. Thus, the technical support services would not be described in any of the categories in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if considered separately.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a digital content transaction if considered separately, paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified within a single category under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if its predominant character is described in that paragraph. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer. The predominant character of this transaction is therefore the transfer of a copyrighted article because the primary benefit or value received by Corp E is the right to use Program X. Accordingly, this transaction is classified solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(C) Taking into account all facts and circumstances, under the benefits and burdens test Corp E is not properly treated as the owner of the copyrighted article. Corp E does not receive the right to use Program X in perpetuity, but only for so long as it continues to make payments. Corp E does not have the right to purchase Program X on advantageous (or, indeed, any) terms once a certain amount of money has been paid to Corp A or a certain period has elapsed (which might indicate a sale). Once the agreement is terminated, Corp E will no longer possess any copies of Program X, current or superseded. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section there has been a lease of a copyrighted article.
(13)
Example 13: Sale of a computer program along with right to receive upgrades
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as those in paragraph (h)(12) of this section (
Example 12
), except that, while Corp E must return copies of Program X as new upgrades are received, if the agreement terminates, Corp E may keep the latest version of Program X (although Corp E is still prohibited from selling or otherwise transferring any copy of Program X).
(ii)
Analysis.
For the reasons stated in paragraph (h)(10)(ii)(B) of this section (
Example 10
), the transfer of the program will be treated as a sale of a copyrighted article rather than as a lease.
(14)
Example 14: Sale of a modified computer program
—(i)
Facts.
Corp G enters into a contract with Corp A for Corp A to modify Program X so that it can be used at Corp G's facility in Country Z. Under the contract, Corp G is to acquire one copy of the program on a disk and the right to use the program on 5,000 workstations. The contract requires Corp A to rewrite elements of Program X so that it will conform to Country Z accounting standards and states that Corp A retains all copyright rights in the modified Program
X. The agreement between Corp A and Corp G is otherwise identical as to rights and payment terms as the agreement described in paragraph (h)(10) of this section (
Example 10
).
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) It must be determined whether the transfer of disks with modified copies of Program X from Corp A to Corp G is a transaction with multiple elements. There is at least one element, the transfer of copies of Program X, which either is a digital content transaction under paragraph (b)(1) of this section or would be a digital content transaction if considered separately. If there is no additional element, then the transaction is classified as a transfer of a copyrighted article pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. If there is a second element, then paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies and the transaction is classified within a single category under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if its predominant character is described in that paragraph. Pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the modifications made by Corp A before transferring Program X to Corp G do not constitute the provision of services for the development or modification of digital content because Corp A retains all copyright rights with respect to the modified software. Therefore, there is no second element in this transaction and it is classified solely as the transfer of copyrighted articles.
(B) Taking into account all facts and circumstances, Corp G is properly treated as the owner of copyrighted articles. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, there has been the sale of a copyrighted article rather than the grant of a lease.
(15)
Example 15: Provision of services for development of a computer program
—(i)
Facts.
Corp H enters into a license agreement for a new computer program. Program Q is to be written by Corp A. Corp A and Corp H agree that Corp A is writing Program Q for Corp H and that, when Program Q is completed, the copyright in Program Q will belong to Corp H. Corp H gives instructions to Corp A programmers regarding program specifications. Corp H agrees to pay Corp A a fixed monthly sum during development of the program. If Corp H is dissatisfied with the development of the program, it may cancel the contract at the end of any month. In the event of termination, Corp A will retain all payments, while any procedures, techniques or copyrightable interests will be the property of Corp H. All of the payments are labelled royalties. There is no provision in the agreement for any continuing relationship between Corp A and Corp H, such as the furnishing of updates of the program, after completion of the modification work.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the provision of computer program development services by Corp A to Corp H is a digital content transaction with one element, which is the provision of services for the development or modification of digital content. Under paragraph (d) of this section, the transaction between Corp A and Corp H involves the provision of services for the development of a computer program because Corp H bears all of the risks of loss associated with the development of Program Q and is the owner of all copyright rights in Program Q. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, Corp A is treated as providing services to Corp H described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the fact that the agreement is labelled a license is not controlling (nor is the fact that Corp A receives a sum labelled a royalty).
(16)
Example 16: Provision of know-how by computer programmers
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A and Corp I, a Country Z corporation, agree that a development engineer employed by Corp A will travel to Country Z to provide know-how relating to certain techniques not generally known to computer programmers, which will enable Corp I to more efficiently create computer programs. These techniques represent the product of experience gained by Corp A from working on many computer programming projects, and are furnished to Corp I under nondisclosure conditions. Such information is property subject to trade secret protection.
(ii)
Analysis.
The provision of know-how with respect to computer programming techniques by Corp A's development engineer to Corp I is described in
paragraph (e) of this section. Therefore, the transaction is a digital content transaction with one element, which is the provision of know-how. The transaction is classified solely as the provision of know-how pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section.
(17)
Example 17: Sale of development program in transaction with multiple elements
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A transfers a disk containing Program Y to Corp E in exchange for a single fixed payment. Program Y is a computer program development program, which is used to create other computer programs, consisting of several components, including libraries of reusable software components that serve as general building blocks in new software applications. Because a computer program created with the use of Program Y will not operate unless the libraries are also present, the license agreement between Corp A and Corp E grants Corp E the right to distribute copies of the libraries with any program developed using Program Y. The license agreement is otherwise identical to the license agreement in paragraph (h)(1) of this section (
Example 1
). Corp A cannot reasonably ascertain the primary benefit or value of the transaction to Corp E. A customer like Corp E derives two benefits from this or a substantially similar transaction, the first of which is the ability to use Program Y to develop new software and the second of which is the right to utilize the libraries and reusable software components in Program Y in distributed programs. Corp A possesses data arising from market research and customer surveys indicating that customers utilize Program Y primarily for its computer program development features and do not make significant use of the libraries of reusable software components. The libraries and reusable software components are not significant components of any overall new program created by using Program Y.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The transaction between Corp A and Corp E has multiple elements. One element is the transfer of a disk with a copy of Program Y, which would be described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (transfer of a copyrighted article) if considered separately. Another element is the grant of the right to distribute copies of the libraries of reusable software components with any program developed using Program Y, which would be described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (c)(2)(i) of this section (transfer of a copyright right) if considered separately.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a digital content transaction if considered separately, paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified within a single category under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if its predominant character is described in that paragraph. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the predominant character of a transaction is generally based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer. If the primary benefit or value is not reasonably ascertainable, paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section provides that the predominant character of a transaction may be determined based on the primary benefit or value to a typical customer of a substantially similar transaction. This primary benefit or value to a typical customer can be identified through actual data about use or access pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, or if that data is not available, by other evidence indicative of the primary benefit or value to a typical customer pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. Although there are two benefits in this type of transaction, Corp A possesses data indicating that a typical customer primarily uses Program Y because of its computer program development features, rather than the right to distribute reusable components. This is reinforced by the fact that programs created using Program Y do not contain libraries of reusable software components as significant components. These facts indicate that the primary benefit or value to a typical customer arises from the ability to use Program Y, rather than the right to distribute reusable components. Therefore, the predominant character of this transaction is the transfer of a copy of Program Y, and this transaction is thus classified solely as the transfer of a copyrighted article described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(C) Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, Corp E is properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, there has been the sale of a copyrighted article rather than the grant of a lease.
(18)
Example 18: Sale of a computer program with right to make modifications
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A transfers a disk containing Program X to Corp E. The disk contains both the object code and the source code to Program X, and the license agreement grants Corp E the right to modify the source code to correct minor errors and make minor adaptations to Program X so it will function on Corp E's computer; as well as the right to recompile the modified source code. The license does not grant Corp E the right to distribute the modified Program X to the public. The license is otherwise identical to the license agreement in paragraph (h)(1) of this section (
Example 1
). Corp A has ascertained that the primary benefit or value received by Corp E from the transaction is the core functionality of Program X rather than the limited rights to modify the source code.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The transaction between Corp A and Corp E has multiple elements. One element is the transfer of a disk with a copy of Program X, which would be described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (transfer of a copyrighted article) if considered separately. Another element is the grant of the right to modify the source code to Program X and recompile the modified source code to create new code to correct minor errors, and to make minor adaptations to Program X, which would be described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section (transfer of a copyright right) if considered separately.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a digital content transaction if considered separately, paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified within a single category under the categories described under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if its predominant character is described in that paragraph. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer, if it is reasonably ascertainable. Since the primary benefit or value received by Corp E is the core functionality of Program X, rather than the limited rights to modify the source code, the predominant character of this transaction is the transfer of a copyrighted article. Therefore, this transaction is classified solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(C) Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, Corp E is properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article. Therefore, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, there has been the sale of a copyrighted article rather than the grant of a lease.
(19)
Example 19: License to website operator to make and sell copies of electronic books via download
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A operates a website that offers electronic books for download onto customers' computers or other electronic devices. The books offered are protected by copyright law. In a transaction between Corp A and a content owner, Corp A receives from the content owner a digital master copy of a book, which Corp A downloads onto its server. Corp A receives the non-exclusive right to reproduce an unlimited number of copies of the book for purposes of distribution and sale to the public. Corp A pays the content owner a specified amount for each copy sold to a customer. Corp A may not transfer any of the rights it receives from the content owner. The term of the agreement Corp A has with the content owner is shorter than the remaining life of the copyright. The content owner has ascertained that the primary benefit or value Corp A receives in the transaction is the right to reproduce and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the book and not the transfer of a copy of the book. In a separate transaction, Corp A charges a customer a fixed fee for each book purchased. When purchasing a book from Corp A on Corp A's website, the customer must acknowledge the terms of a license agreement with the content owner that states that the customer may download and view the electronic
book in perpetuity but may not reproduce, distribute, or sell copies of it. Once the customer downloads the book from Corp A's server onto a device, the customer may access and view the book from that device, which does not need to be connected to the internet for the customer to view the book. The customer owes no additional payment to Corp A for the ability to view the book in the future.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Notwithstanding the license agreement between each customer and the content owner granting the customer rights to use the book, the relevant transactions are the transfer of a master copy of the book along with the grant from the content owners to Corp A of the right to reproduce and sell to the public copies of the books, and the transfers of copies of the books by Corp A to customers. Although the content owner is identified as a party to the license agreement memorializing the customer's rights with respect to the book, each customer obtains those rights directly from Corp A, not from the content owner. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the download of a copy of a book by a customer is a digital content transaction with one element, which is the transfer of a digital copy of a book. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Under the benefits and burdens test of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the transaction is classified as a sale and not a lease, because the customer receives the right to view the book in perpetuity on its device.
(B) The transaction between the content owner and Corp A has multiple elements. One element is the transfer of a master copy of the book, which would be described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (transfer of a copyrighted article) if considered separately. Another element is the grant of the right to reproduce and sell an unlimited number of copies to customers, which would be described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (c)(2)(i) of this section (transfer of a copyright right) if considered separately. Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a digital content transaction if considered separately, paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified within a single category under the categories described under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if its predominant character is described in that paragraph. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer, if it is reasonably ascertainable. Since the primary benefit or value Corp A receives in the transaction is the right to reproduce and distribute an unlimited number of copies, the predominant character of this transaction is the transfer of a copyright right. Therefore, this transaction is classified solely as a transfer of copyright rights described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(C) Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, there has been a license of books to Corp A. Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, there has not been a transfer of all substantial rights in the copyright rights to the books because each content owner has the right to enter into other licenses with respect to the copyright of their book. Corp A has acquired no right itself to license the copyrights in the books. Finally, the terms of the licenses are for less than the remaining lives of the copyrights in the books.
(20)
Example 20: Internet platform operator as agent for application developers
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A operates a platform on the internet that offers applications for download onto a customer's mobile phone. Under general tax principles, Corp A and an application developer establish an agency relationship whereby Corp A acts as the agent to offer the application for sale to customers on behalf of the application developer. The applications are protected by copyright law. Under the agreement between Corp A and the application developer, Corp A agrees to provide the application developer with platform and agency services to facilitate the sale of the application to customers. Corp A also provides the application developer with hosting services to host the application on Corp A's servers for download by the customers. Corp A receives a digital master copy of the application along with a non-exclusive right to make
copies of the application and allow customers to download copies of the application from Corp A's platform. Corp A has ascertained that the primary benefit or value from the transaction received by the application developer is the platform and agency services that Corp A provides. Corp A receives the right to make copies of the application merely to perform its activities as an agent on behalf of the application developer. When purchasing an application on Corp A's platform, the customer must acknowledge the terms of a license agreement with the application developer that states that the customer may use the application but may not reproduce or distribute copies of it. In addition, the agreement provides that the customer may download the application onto only one mobile phone at a time. A customer does not need to be connected to the internet to access the application. The customer owes no additional payment to Corp A or the application developer for the ability to use the application in perpetuity. Corp A retains a fixed percentage of each purchase price of the application and remits the remaining balance to the application developer.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The transaction between Corp A and the application developer has multiple elements. One element is the transfer of a master copy of an application by the application developer to Corp A, which would be described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (transfer of a copyrighted article) if considered separately. Another element is the transfer of the right to make and distribute copies of the application by the application developer to Corp A, which would be described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (c)(2) of this section (transfer of a copyright right) if considered separately. A third element is the platform and agency services provided by Corp A to the application developer, which would not be described in this section if considered separately. A fourth element is the hosting services provided by Corp A to the application developer, which would be described in § 1.861-19 if considered separately. Under the facts and circumstances, although Corp A receives a copy of the application and the right to make and distribute copies of the application, Corp A receives this copy and right merely to facilitate the sale of applications on behalf of the application developer.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a digital content transaction if considered separately, paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified within a single category under the categories described under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if its predominant character is described in that paragraph. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer, if it is reasonably ascertainable. Since the primary benefit or value the application developer receives in the transaction is the platform and agency services, the predominant character of this transaction is the platform and agency services and not a digital content transaction nor a cloud transaction.
(C) The transfer of a copy of an application from the application developer to a customer is a digital content transaction with one element, which is the transfer of a copy of a digital program. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Under the benefits and burdens test of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, this transaction is a sale of a copyrighted article because a customer has the right to use the application in perpetuity.
(21)
Example 21: Movies and TV shows available for stream, rent, or purchase
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A offers a catalog of movies and TV shows, all of which are subject to copyright protection. Corp A gives customers several options for viewing the content, each of which has a separate price. A “streaming” option allows a customer to view the video, which is hosted on Corp A's servers, while connected to the internet for as many times as the customer wants during a limited period. A “rent” option allows a customer to download the video to its computer or other electronic device (which does not need to be connected to the internet for viewing) and watch the video as many
times as the customer wants for a limited period, after which an electronic lock is activated and the customer may no longer view the content. A “purchase” option allows a customer to download the video and view it as many times as the customer chooses with no end date. Under all three options, the customer may view the video but may not reproduce or distribute copies of it, prepare derivative works based on it, or publicly display it.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) With respect to the “rent” option, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section the download of a video by a customer is a digital content transaction with one element, which is the transfer of a copy of the video. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as the transfer of a copyrighted article under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Although a customer will retain a copy of the content at the end of the payment term, the customer cannot access the content after the electronic lock is activated. The activation of the electronic lock is the equivalent of having to return the copy. Therefore, the transaction is classified as a lease of a copyrighted article under paragraph (f)(2) of this section because the customer's right to view the videos is for a limited period.
(B) With respect to the “purchase” option, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section the download of a video by a customer is a digital content transaction with one element, which is the transfer of a copy of the video. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as the transfer of a copyrighted article under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The transaction is classified as a sale of a copyrighted article under paragraph (f)(2) of this section because the customer receives the right to view the videos in perpetuity.
(C) With respect to the “streaming” option, the transaction is Corp A's grant of the right to its customers to view the movies or shows while connected to the internet for a limited period. There is no transfer of any copyright rights described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. There is also no transfer of a copyrighted article because the content is not downloaded by a customer, but rather, is accessed through an on-demand network. The transaction also does not constitute the provision of services for the development of digital content or the provision of know-how under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Therefore, the transaction is not a digital content transaction described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Instead, the transaction is a cloud transaction that is classified under § 1.861-19. See § 1.861-19(b).
(22)
Example 22: Website offering third-party videos via stream
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A operates a website that allows customers to stream videos that third-party content creators upload to Corp A's website. Corp A has advertising contracts with third-party advertisers pursuant to which Corp A earns advertising revenue when a customer views a video. Customers can either stream videos for free with advertisements or can pay a subscription fee to stream videos without advertisements. Under the contract between Corp A and content creators, content creators retain all ownership rights in their videos and must own or have the necessary rights to publish their videos. The contract also states that content creators grant Corp A a non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, distribute, and display their videos in connection with Corp A's website, and grant customers a non-exclusive license to view the videos. These licenses terminate within a commercially reasonable time after a content creator removes or deletes a video from Corp A's website. Content creators have ascertained that the primary benefit or value Corp A receives from transactions with content creators is the right to use, reproduce, distribute, and display their videos. Corp A pays content creators a percentage of advertising revenue generated from the videos and a percentage of subscription fees.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The transaction between Corp A and the content creators has multiple elements. One element is the uploading of a video by a content creator, which would be described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (transfer of a copyrighted article) if considered separately. Another element is the grant by content creators
to Corp A of the right to use, reproduce, distribute, and display their videos, which would be described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (transfer of a copyright right) if considered separately. Content creators are not providing content development services to Corp A under paragraph (d) of this section because content creators own the copyright rights in the videos.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a digital content transaction if considered separately, paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified within a single category under the categories described under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if its predominant character is described in that paragraph. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer. The predominant character of the transaction is therefore the transfer of copyright rights because the primary benefit or value received by Corp A is the right to use, reproduce, distribute, and display videos. Accordingly, this transaction is characterized solely as a transfer of a copyright right as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(C) Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, there has been a license of videos to Corp A. Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, there has not been a transfer of all substantial rights in the copyright rights to the videos because each content owner has the right to enter into other licenses with respect to the copyright of their videos. Corp A has acquired no right itself to license the copyrights in the videos. Finally, the terms of the licenses are for less than the remaining lives of the copyrights in the videos.
(D) For both the free streaming and subscription streaming transactions between Corp A and customers, there is no transfer of any copyright rights described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. There is also no transfer of a copyrighted article, because the content is not downloaded by a customer, but rather is accessed through an on-demand network. The transactions also do not constitute the provision of services for the development of digital content or the provision of know-how under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Therefore, paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to such transactions. Instead, both transactions are cloud transactions that are classified under § 1.861-19. See § 1.861-19(b).
(23)
Example 23: Sale of computer programs electronically through a reseller
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A owns the copyright to software (Program S). Corp A hosts Program S on its servers. Corp A grants Corp B, a foreign corporation wholly owned by Corp A, the right to distribute copies of Program S (without the right to reproduce copies of Program S) to Corp B's customers that are located in Corp B's country. Under the agreement between Corp A and Corp B, Corp B pays Corp A a fixed fee for each copy of Program S that Corp A delivers to a customer. In separate transactions, customers pay Corp B for the right to receive digital copies of Program S that they may then use in perpetuity without further payment. Corp B is responsible for managing the purchase/sale interaction with Corp B's customers, including invoicing and collections. Corp A is responsible for creating and delivering the digital copies of Program S to Corp B's customers from Corp A's servers. Corp B does not perform any functions to provide access to Program S.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Although there is a single contract between Corp A and Corp B that grants a legal right to Corp B with respect to Program S, that right (the right to distribute) is not a copyright right described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (c)(2) of this section. Instead, the transactions between Corp A and Corp B and then Corp B and its customers are functionally and economically equivalent to back-to-back transfers of copyrighted articles. The transfers are only superficially different from those described in paragraph (h)(24) of this section (
Example 24
) where the reseller acquires product keys and sells them on to customers. Therefore, each sale of a copy of Program S by Corp B to a customer should be viewed as a transfer of a copyrighted article from Corp A to Corp B and then from Corp B to the customer.
(B) The transaction between Corp A and Corp B is a digital content transaction with a single element that is classified as a transfer of a copyrighted article described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. There are no additional elements because Corp B's receipt of the right to distribute copies of Program S (without the right to make copies) is not a copyright right described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Under the benefits and burdens test of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the transfer is classified as the sale of a copyrighted article.
(C) The transaction between Corp B and a customer is a digital content transaction with a single element that is classified as a transfer of a copyrighted article described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Under the benefits and burdens test of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, this transaction is a sale of a copyrighted article because the customer has the right to use the application in perpetuity.
(24)
Example 24: Sale of video games with online and offline functionality through retailers using digital keys
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A owns the copyright in a computer program (Program Y). Corp A creates digital keys that allow for the download of one copy of Program Y from Corp A's website. Corp A sells these digital keys to retailers for a one-time fee per key, and the retailers do not use Program Y, but instead sell them in separate transactions to customers for a one-time fee per key. Corp A ascertains that the primary benefit or value to retailers from the purchase of digital keys from Corp A is the right to further transfer the digital keys to customers. The retailers cannot reasonably ascertain the primary benefit or value that their specific customers derive from Program Y, nor is there data available to the retailers about how their customers typically use Program Y. Program Y is a video game that contains online and offline features, both of which can be played without paying an additional game-specific cost after paying the one-time fee to purchase a key. The offline feature is comprised of a single-player story that does not require any internet connection to play. The online feature is comprised of the ability to play competitive matches against other players that are hosted on servers owned by Corp A. The competitive matches require an ongoing connection to the internet to play. Neither the customers nor the retailer receives any copyright rights described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to Program Y. Customers can use Program Y in perpetuity. Program Y is primarily marketed as a single-player game in television and online advertising, with only brief mentions of the multiplayer mode in print advertising. The development cost for Program Y was allocated 40% to developing the single-player content, 20% to developing the multiplayer content, and 40% to developing content that is used by both types of content (
e.g.,
cost of developing the game engine).
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The transaction between Corp A and a retailer has multiple elements. One element is the transfer of a key with the right to download a copy of Program Y for use to play the offline story, which would be a digital content transaction described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (transfer of a copyrighted article) if considered separately. Another element is the transfer of the same key with a copy of Program Y providing on-demand network access to digital content in the form of competitive multiplayer functionality, which would be a cloud transaction described in § 1.861-19(b) if considered separately.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one of which would be a digital content transaction if considered separately and one of which would be a cloud transaction if considered separately, paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified within a single category under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if its predominant character is described in that paragraph, or the transaction is classified solely as a cloud transaction if its predominant character is a cloud transaction pursuant to § 1.861-19(c)(2). Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer, if it is reasonably ascertainable. The predominant character of
this transaction is therefore the transfer of copyrighted articles because the primary benefit or value received by a retailer is the right to further transfer the same copyrighted articles to customers in the form of digital keys. The retailers do not have any intent to utilize the cloud functionality of the digital keys, although they do have the right to do so. Therefore, this transaction is classified solely as a transfer of copyrighted articles described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(C) Under the benefits and burdens test of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the transfer between Corp A and a retailer is classified as the sale of a copyrighted article because the retailer has the right to use, or sell, Program Y in perpetuity without further payment.
(D) The transfer of a key (with the right to download a copy of Program Y) by a retailer to a customer also contains the same two elements as each transaction between Corp A and a retailer. However, a retailer cannot reasonably ascertain the primary benefit or value derived by a specific customer from Program Y. In such situations, paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section provides that the predominant character of a transaction may be determined based on the primary benefit or value to a typical customer of a substantially similar transaction. This primary benefit or value to a typical customer can be identified through actual data about use or access pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, or if that data is not available, by using other evidence indicative of the primary benefit or value to a typical customer pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. Because the retailers do not have available data about how customers use Program Y, they may use the marketing with respect to Program Y to determine that its predominant character is that of a transfer of a copyrighted article described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The relative development costs of the offline and online components of the game could also be used if they are known to a retailer. Therefore, the transfer between a retailer and a customer of a digital key containing the right to download a copy of Program Y is classified solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article.
(E) Under the benefits and burdens test of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the transfer between a retailer and a customer is classified as the sale of a copyrighted article because the customer has the right to use Program Y in perpetuity without further payment.
(25)
Example 25: Source of income from the sale of a copyrighted article transferred through an electronic medium
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A is the parent company of a world-wide group of affiliated companies. Corp B is a foreign corporation wholly owned by Corp A. In the ordinary course of business, Corp B acts as a procurement hub for Corp A's affiliated companies. In this role, Corp B regularly purchases products that will be distributed amongst Corp A's affiliated companies to be used by them in their respective businesses. Corp B purchases digital copies of a computer program (Program Y) from Corp C, an unrelated company. Corp B may use Program Y in perpetuity without further payment. Corp B receives no copyright rights in Program Y. Corp B does not use Program Y, and instead distributes all of its copies of Program Y to various affiliates. Corp C sources income from the sale of Program Y using sections 861(a)(6) and 862(a)(6).
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the transfer of Program Y from Corp C to Corp B is a digital content transaction with one element, which is the transfer of a copy of Program Y. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as transfers of a copyrighted articles under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, there have been sales of copies of Program Y to Corp B under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
(B) Income from the sale of Program Y by Corp C is sourced pursuant to sections 861(a)(6) and 862(a)(6) to the place where the sale occurred. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, a transfer of a copyrighted article through an electronic medium is treated as occurring at the billing address of the purchaser, in this case Corp B, unless the sales transaction is arranged for a principal purpose of tax avoidance. In this case, the sale is treated as
occurring at the billing address of Corp B, and Corp C's income is foreign source, even though Corp B will not use Program Y, because Corp B regularly purchases products that will be distributed amongst its affiliates to be used in their respective businesses, and therefore there is no evidence that Corp B was used by Corp A to purchase Program Y with a principal purpose of tax avoidance.
(26)
Example 26: Application of anti-abuse rule for sale of a copyrighted article transferred through an electronic medium
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A is the parent company of a world-wide group of affiliated companies. Corp B is a foreign affiliate of Corp A. In the ordinary course of business, Corp B does not act as a procurement hub regularly purchasing products for use by Corp A's affiliated companies. Corp A negotiates an agreement with Corp C, an unrelated company, to purchase digital copies of a computer program (Program Y) for use in Corp A's business. The agreement grants Corp A the right to use Program Y in perpetuity for a one-time payment. Corp C requests that Corp B be the purchaser of the copies of Program Y even though Corp B will not use Program Y and is not otherwise involved in the transaction between Corp A and Corp C for a principal purpose of tax avoidance. Corp A agrees, and Corp B purchases the copies of Program Y and subsequently distributes them to Corp A. Corp C sources income from the sale of Program Y using sections 861(a)(6) and 862(a)(6).
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the transfer of Program Y from Corp C to Corp B is a digital content transaction with one element, which is the transfer of a copy of Program Y. Therefore, the transaction is classified solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, there have been sales of copies of Program Y to Corp B under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
(B) Income from the sale of Program Y by Corp C is sourced pursuant to sections 861(a)(6) and 862(a)(6) to the place where the sale occurred. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, a transfer of a copyrighted article through an electronic medium is treated as occurring at the billing address of the purchaser, in this case Corp B, unless the sales transaction is arranged for a principal purpose of tax avoidance. In this case, Corp B does not regularly purchase products that will be used by other companies within Corp A's group of affiliated companies, and Corp B was instead used as the purchaser of Program Y on behalf of Corp A with a principal purpose of tax avoidance. Therefore, the place where the sale occurred must be determined based on all relevant facts and circumstances. Corp A negotiated the purchase, and the software will be used by Corp A in its business. As a result, under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the sale is treated as occurring at the location of Corp A and the income derived by Corp C from the sale is U.S. source.
(C) The same result would apply if, instead of using Corp B for the purchase, Corp A made the purchase but rented a P.O. Box outside the United States to serve as the billing address for the transaction with a principal purpose of tax avoidance.

§ 1.861-19
Classification of cloud transactions.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules for classifying cloud transactions (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section). The rules of this section apply for purposes of Internal Revenue Code sections 59A, 245A, 250, 267A, 367, 404A, 482, 679, and 1059A; subchapter N of chapter 1; chapters 3 and 4; and sections 842 and 845 (to the extent involving a foreign person), and apply with respect to transfers to foreign trusts not covered by section 679.
(b)
Cloud transaction defined.
A cloud transaction is a transaction through which a person obtains on-demand network access to computer hardware, digital content (as defined in § 1.861-18(a)(2)), or other similar resources. A cloud transaction does not include network access to download digital content for storage and use on a person's computer or other electronic device.
(c)
Classification of cloud transactions
—(1)
In general.
A cloud transaction is classified as the provision of services.
(2)
Transaction with multiple elements.
Taking into account the overall transaction and the surrounding facts and circumstances, a transaction that has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a cloud transaction if considered separately, is classified in its entirety as a cloud transaction if the predominant character of the transaction as determined under § 1.861-18(b)(3) is a cloud transaction.
(d)
Examples.
The examples in this paragraph (d) illustrate the provisions of this section. Unless otherwise specified, assume that Corp A is a domestic corporation, no rights described in § 1.861-18(c)(2) (copyright rights) are transferred as part of the transactions described, and all facts in each example occur as part of a single transaction.
(1)
Example 1: Computing capacity
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A operates data centers on its premises in various locations. Corp A provides Corp B computing capacity on Corp A's servers in exchange for a monthly fee based on the amount of computing power made available to Corp B. Corp B provides its own software to run on Corp A's servers.
(ii)
Analysis.
The provision of on-demand network computing capacity by Corp A to Corp B is a cloud transaction with one element. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as a cloud transaction under paragraph (b) of this section and is classified as the provision of services under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(2)
Example 2: Computing capacity on dedicated on-premises servers
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that, in order to offer more security to Corp B, Corp A provides Corp B computing capacity exclusively through designated servers, which are owned and operated by Corp A and located at Corp B's facilities. Corp A agrees not to use the designated server for any other customer for the duration of its arrangement with Corp B. Although the server is located at Corp B's facilities, Corp B accesses the server through Corp A's network and the monthly fee is based on the amount of computing power made available to Corp B.
(ii)
Analysis.
As in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (
Example 1
), the transaction between Corp A and Corp B is the provision of on-demand network computing capacity and is therefore a cloud transaction with one element. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as a cloud transaction under paragraph (b) of this section and is classified as the provision of services under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the transaction between Corp A and Corp B involved only the provision of a server by Corp A for use by Corp B, and not on-demand network access to computing capacity, the transaction would not be a cloud transaction and this section would not apply.
(3)
Example 3: Access to software development platform and website hosting
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A provides Corp B a software platform that Corp B uses to develop and deploy websites with a range of features, including blogs, message boards, and other collaborative knowledge bases. The software development platform consists of an operating system, web server software, scripting languages, libraries, tools, and back-end relational database software and allows Corp B to use in its websites certain visual elements subject to copyrights held by Corp A. The software development platform is hosted on servers owned by Corp A and located at Corp A's facilities. Corp B's finished websites are also hosted on Corp A's servers. Corp B accesses the software development platform via a standard web browser. Corp B has no ability to alter the software code. A small amount of copyrighted scripting code is downloaded onto Corp B's computers to facilitate secure logins and access to the software development platform. All other functions of the software development platform execute on Corp A's servers, and no portion of the core software code is ever downloaded by Corp B or Corp B's customers. Corp A has ascertained that the primary benefit or value to Corp B from the transaction is the right to use the software development platform. Corp B pays Corp A a monthly fee for the platform and website hosting.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) There is one transaction with multiple elements between Corp A and Corp B. One element is Corp A's provision to Corp B of on-demand network access to the software platform, which would be a cloud transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section if considered separately. Another element is Corp A's hosting of Corp B's finished websites, which would be a cloud transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section if considered separately. A third element is the grant by Corp A to Corp B of the right to use in Corp B's websites certain visual elements subject to copyrights held by Corp A, which would be a transfer of copyright rights under § 1.861-18(b)(1)(i) if considered separately. A fourth element is the download of scripting code by Corp B, which would be a transfer of a copyrighted article under § 1.861-18(b)(1)(ii) if considered separately.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a cloud transaction if considered separately, paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified as a cloud transaction if its predominant character is a cloud transaction. Pursuant to § 1.861-18(b)(3), the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer, if it is reasonably ascertainable. The predominant character of this transaction is therefore a cloud transaction because the primary benefit or value received by Corp B is the right to use the software development platform. Accordingly, this transaction is classified solely as a cloud transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section and is classified as the provision of services under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(4)
Example 4: Access to online software via an application
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A provides Corp B word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation software and allows employees of Corp B to access the software over the internet through a web browser or an application (“app”) that can be downloaded from Corp A's servers onto a computer or mobile device. Corp B's employees usually download Corp A's app onto their mobile devices. To access the full functionality of the app, the device must be connected to the internet. Only a limited number of features on the app are available without an internet connection. Corp B has no ability to alter the software code. The software is hosted on servers owned by Corp A and located at Corp A's facilities and is used concurrently by other Corp A customers in addition to Corp B. Corp B pays a monthly fee based on the number of employees with access to the software. Users have the option to save files either online using the storage provided by Corp B, or offline on their own hard drives. Corp B's employees can also download updates to the app as part of the monthly fee arrangement. Upon termination of the arrangement, Corp A activates an electronic lock preventing Corp B's employees from further utilizing the app,
and Corp B's employees are no longer able to access the software via a web browser. Corp A has ascertained that the primary benefit or value to Corp B from the transaction is the right to access Corp A's software over the internet, whether via web browser or after downloading the app.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) There is one transaction with multiple elements between Corp A and Corp B. One element is Corp A's provision to Corp B of on-demand network access to Corp A's computer hardware and software resources for the purpose of fully utilizing Corp A's software, which would be a cloud transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section if considered separately. Another element is the download of Corp A's app by Corp B employees, which would be a transfer of a copyrighted article under § 1.861-18(b)(1)(ii) if considered separately.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a cloud transaction if considered separately, paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified as a cloud transaction if its predominant character is a cloud transaction. Pursuant to § 1.861-18(b)(3), the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer, if it is reasonably ascertainable. The predominant character of this transaction is therefore a cloud transaction because the primary benefit or value received by Corp B is the right to access Corp A's software over the internet. Accordingly, this transaction is classified solely as a cloud transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section and is classified as the provision of services under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

Example 5: Access to offline software with limited online functions
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A provides Corp B word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation software that is functionally similar to the software in paragraph (d)(4) of this section (
Example 4
). The software is made available for access over the internet but only to download the software from servers owned by Corp A onto a computer or mobile device in the form of an app. The downloaded software contains all the core functions of the software. Employees of Corp B can use the software on their computers or mobile devices regardless of whether their computer or mobile device is online. When online, the software provides a few ancillary functions that are not available offline, such as access to document templates and data collection for diagnosing problems with the software. Whether working online or offline, Corp B employees can store their files only on their own computer or mobile device, and not on Corp A's data storage servers. Corp B's employees can also download updates to the software as part of the monthly fee arrangement. Upon termination of the arrangement, an electronic lock is activated so that the software can no longer be accessed. Corp A has ascertained that the primary benefit or value to Corp B from the transaction is the right to download and use Corp A's software offline.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The transaction between Corp A and Corp B contains multiple elements. One element is the transfer of a copy of Corp A's software via download, which would be a transfer of a copyrighted article described under § 1.861-18(b)(1)(ii) if considered separately. Another element is the provision of online ancillary functionality of the software, which would be a cloud transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section if considered separately.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a cloud transaction if considered separately, paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified as a cloud transaction if its predominant character is a cloud transaction. Pursuant to § 1.861-18(b)(3), the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer, if it is reasonably ascertainable. The predominant character of this transaction is therefore the transfer of a copyrighted article because the primary benefit or value received by Corp B is the right to download and use Corp A's software offline. Accordingly, this transaction is classified solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article described in § 1.861-18(b)(1)(ii). The provision of the software constitutes a lease of a copyrighted article under § 1.861-18
because access to the app is terminated when the monthly fee is no longer paid, even though Corp B employees retain the locked files on their devices. See § 1.861-18(h)(4).
(6)
Example 6: Data storage, separate from access to offline software
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 5
), except that Corp A also provides on-demand network data storage to Corp B on Corp A's servers in exchange for a monthly fee based on the amount of data storage used by Corp B. Under the data storage terms, Corp B employees may store files created by Corp B employees using Corp A's software or other software. Although Corp A's word processing software is compatible with Corp A's data storage systems, the core functionality of Corp A's software is not dependent on Corp B's purchase of the storage plan. Corp A's provision of software and data storage capacity constitute separate transactions.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) As explained in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, Corp B's download of fully functional software, along with on-demand network access to certain limited online features, does not constitute a cloud transaction, but rather constitutes a lease of a copyrighted article under § 1.861-18.
(B) The provision of on-demand network data storage by Corp A to Corp B is a cloud transaction with one element. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as a cloud transaction under paragraph (b) of this section and is classified as the provision of services under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(7)
Example 7: Streaming and temporary download of digital content using third-party servers
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A offers via stream or temporary download digital content in the form of videos and music to customers from servers located in data centers owned and operated by Data Center Operator. Each customer uses a computer or other electronic device to access unlimited streaming or temporary downloads of video and music in exchange for payment of a flat monthly fee to Corp A. The customer may select from among the available content the particular video or song to be streamed or downloaded. Corp A continually updates its content catalog, replacing content with higher quality versions and adding new content at no additional charge to the customer. It also provides additional functionality such as various methods of filtering and sorting the library, a watchlist, and recommendations based on a customer's preferences. Content that is streamed to the customer is not stored locally on the customer's computer or other electronic device and therefore can be played only while the customer's computer or other electronic device is connected to the internet. Content that is temporarily downloaded is stored on the customer's computer or other electronic device for 1 week and therefore can be played while the customer's computer or other electronic device is not connected to the internet. Corp A cannot reasonably ascertain the primary benefit or value that its specific customers derive from accessing Corp A's catalog of digital content. Data collected by Corp A indicates that the vast majority of customers stream digital content rather than temporarily download the content. Corp A pays Data Center Operator a fee based on the amount of data storage used and computing power made available in connection with Corp A's content offerings.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The provision of data storage and computing power by Data Center Operator to Corp A is a cloud transaction with one element. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as a cloud transaction under paragraph (b) of this section, and is classified as the provision of services under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(B) A transaction between Corp A and a customer has two elements. One element is streaming access to a curated and routinely updated library of digital content, which would be a cloud transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section if considered separately. Another element is the transfer of a copy of digital content via temporary download, which would be a transfer of a copyrighted article under § 1.861-18(b)(1)(ii) if considered separately.
(C) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which
would be a cloud transaction if considered separately, paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified as a cloud transaction if its predominant character is a cloud transaction. Pursuant to § 1.861-18(b)(3), the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer if it is reasonably ascertainable. However, Corp A cannot reasonably ascertain the primary benefit or value derived by a specific customer from Corp A's offering. In such situations, § 1.861-18(b)(3)(ii) provides that the predominant character of a transaction may be determined based on the primary benefit or value to a typical customer of a substantially similar transaction. This primary benefit or value to a typical customer can be identified through actual data about use or access pursuant to § 1.861-18(b)(3)(ii)(A), or if that data is not available, by using other evidence indicative of the primary benefit or value to a typical customer pursuant to § 1.861-18(b)(3)(ii)(B). Because Corp A has data that shows the typical customer streams digital content rather than temporarily downloading it, the primary benefit or value received by a typical customer is streaming access to digital content. Therefore, the predominant character of the transaction is a cloud transaction. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the cloud transaction is classified as the provision of services.
(8)
Example 8: Access to online database
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A offers an online database of industry-specific materials. Customers access the materials through Corp A's website, which aggregates and organizes information topically and hosts a proprietary search engine. Corp A hosts the website and database on its own servers and provides multiple customers access to the website and database concurrently. Most materials in Corp A's database are publicly available by other means, but Corp A's website offers an efficient way to locate and obtain the information on demand. Certain materials in Corp A's database constitute digital content within the meaning of § 1.861-18(a)(2), and Corp A pays the copyright owners a license fee for using them. Each customer may download any of the materials to its own computer and keep such materials without further payment. The customer pays Corp A a fee based on the number of searches or the amount of time spent on the website, and such fee is not dependent on the amount of materials the customer downloads. The fee that the customer pays is substantially higher than the stand-alone charge for accessing the same digital content outside of Corp A's system. Corp A cannot reasonably ascertain the primary benefit or value that a specific customer derives from accessing Corp A's database. Corp A does not have data indicating whether the typical customer downloads materials from the database. Corp A markets its website and online database as user-friendly and an efficient way to find relevant materials because of its proprietary search engine. Developing the proprietary search engine was the largest cost Corp A incurred in creating its website and online database.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The transaction between Corp A and a customer has multiple elements. One element is Corp A's provision to a customer of access to Corp A's website and online database, which is a cloud transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section if considered separately. Another element is the transfer of digital content via download, which is the transfer of a copyrighted article under § 1.861-18 if considered separately.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a cloud transaction if considered separately, paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified as a cloud transaction if its predominant character is a cloud transaction. Pursuant to § 1.861-18(b)(3), the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer, if it is reasonably ascertainable. However, Corp A cannot reasonably ascertain the primary benefit or value derived by a specific customer from access to Corp A's database. In such situations, § 1.861-18(b)(3)(ii) provides that the predominant character of a transaction may be determined based on the primary benefit or value
to a typical customer of a substantially similar transaction. This primary benefit or value to a typical customer can be identified through actual data about use or access pursuant to § 1.861-18(b)(3)(ii)(A), or if that data is not available, by using other evidence indicative of the primary benefit or value to a typical customer pursuant to § 1.861-18(b)(3)(ii)(B). That Corp A focuses on its proprietary search engine when marketing its website and database, as well as the facts that the search engine was the most expensive cost incurred by Corp A in creating its website and database, and that customers pay a substantially higher fee to access Corp A's system than they would otherwise pay to access the content outside of Corp A's system, indicates that the primary benefit or value received by a typical customer is the right to use the search engine. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the predominant character of the transaction between Corp A and a customer is a cloud transaction. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section the cloud transaction is classified as the provision of services.
(9)
Example 9: Temporary or perpetual access to a single movie via stream or download
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A hosts movies on its website and allows customers to view a single movie for a limited period or perpetually for a one-time fee, with perpetual viewing rights costing a higher fee. Corp A does not charge customers a separate fee for access to the website. In addition, Corp A's website provides recommendations for movies based on a customer's search for a particular title and/or the customer's purchase history. Customers have no ability to alter the servers, website, or movies available on the website. The movies in Corp A's database constitute digital content within the meaning of § 1.861-18(a)(2), and Corp A pays the copyright owners a license fee for using them. Corp A allows customers to view the movies by either streaming the movies from Corp A's servers, or by downloading the movies onto the customer's computer or other electronic device. The file size of movies offered by Corp A is generally large and so customers may be expected to download movies only in certain situations such as when traveling without internet access. Upon the expiration of the rental period, customers will no longer have access to stream the movies, and any movie that was downloaded onto a customer's computer or other electronic device will auto-delete from the customer's computer or other electronic device. Whether a customer chooses to view the movie via stream or download, Corp A charges the same one-time fee. Corp A cannot reasonably ascertain the primary benefit or value that a specific customer derives from accessing Corp A's website. Corp A maintains aggregate data on whether a given movie is viewed via stream or download, and this data shows that most movies are viewed by streaming, even in the case where a customer pays for the right to view a movie in perpetuity.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) A transaction between Corp A and a customer contains multiple elements. One element is Corp A's provision to a customer of access to Corp A's website in order to view a movie via stream, which is a cloud transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section if considered separately. Another element is Corp A's provision to a customer of access to Corp A's website in order to download a movie, which is the transfer of a copyrighted article under § 1.861-18 if considered separately.
(B) Because the transaction has multiple elements, one or more of which would be a cloud transaction if considered separately, paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides that the transaction is classified as a cloud transaction if its predominant character is a cloud transaction. Pursuant to § 1.861-18(b)(3), the predominant character of the transaction is based on the primary benefit or value of the transaction to the customer, if it is reasonably ascertainable. However, Corp A cannot reasonably ascertain the primary benefit or value derived by a specific customer from access to Corp A's database. In such situations, § 1.861-18(b)(3)(ii) provides that the predominant character of a transaction may be determined based on the primary benefit or value
to a typical customer of a substantially similar transaction. This primary benefit or value to a typical customer can be identified through actual data about use or access pursuant to § 1.861-18(b)(3)(ii)(A), or if that data is not available, by using other evidence indicative of the primary benefit or value to a typical customer pursuant to § 1.861-18(b)(3)(ii)(B). Corp A has data that shows that the typical customer views movies by streaming rather than download. Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the predominant character of the transaction is a cloud transaction because the primary benefit or value a typical customer receives is access to stream movies on Corp A's website. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the cloud transaction is classified as the provision of services.
(10)
Example 10: Reseller of software as a service
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A owns the copyright to software (Program S). Corp A hosts Program S on its servers. Customers access Program S only through an internet connection. Corp A grants Corp B, a foreign corporation wholly owned by Corp A, the right to sell access to Program S to Corp B's customers that are located in Corp B's country. Corp B is responsible for managing the purchase/sale interaction with Corp B's customers, including invoicing and collections. Corp A is responsible for providing customers with access to Program S. Corp B does not perform any functions to provide access to Program S.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The transaction between Corp A and Corp B is treated as Corp A providing on-demand access to Program S to Corp B even though Corp B resells that access. This transaction is a cloud transaction with one element. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the cloud transaction is classified as the provision of services. The transaction does not involve the transfer of any copyright rights described in § 1.861-18(c)(2), and therefore is governed solely by this section.
(B) The transaction between Corp B and its customers is the provision of on-demand access to Program S by Corp B, which is a cloud transaction with one element. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the cloud transaction is classified as the provision of services. The transaction does not involve the transfer of any copyright rights described in § 1.861-18(c)(2), and therefore is governed solely by this section.
(11)
Example 11: Computer game with online functionality and in-game purchases
—(i)
Facts.
Corp A owns the copyright to a computer game (Game X). Customers can purchase Game X for a one-time fee and download it onto their computers. A customer may play certain aspects of Game X while not connected to the internet, but most of the core functionality of Game X is available only when the customer is connected to the internet, including the ability to play with other customers. In order to access the additional online functionality specific to Game X, customers must pay a monthly fee to Corp A. The additional functionality of Game X is hosted on servers owned by Corp A. Customers may also pay a one-time fee to access an in-game item that can be utilized only when playing Game X online.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) There are three transactions between Corp A and a customer. The first transaction is the transfer of a copy of Game X, which is a digital content transaction with one element because a customer receives from Corp A access only to offline content in exchange for purchasing a copy of the game. Therefore, this transaction is treated solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article under § 1.861-18.
(B) The second transaction between Corp A and a customer is the payment of a monthly fee to play Game X online on Corp A's servers, which is a cloud transaction with one element. Therefore, this transaction is treated solely as a cloud transaction, and is classified as the provision of services under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(C) The third transaction between Corp A and a customer is the payment of a one-time fee in exchange for an in-game item. Because a customer can utilize the item only when playing Game X through an internet connection, the transaction is a cloud transaction with one element. Therefore, this transaction is treated solely as a cloud transaction, and is classified as
the provision of services under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(e)

), 1.904-6, 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii), and 1.965-5(b)(2). Paragraph (b) of this section provides definitions for the purposes of this section. Paragraph (c) of this section provides the general rule for allocation and apportionment of foreign income taxes. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for assigning foreign gross income to statutory and residual groupings. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for allocating and apportioning foreign law deductions to foreign gross income in the statutory and residual groupings. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for apportioning foreign income taxes among statutory and residual groupings. Paragraph (g) of this section provides examples that illustrate the application of this section. Paragraph (h) of this section provides the applicability date for this section.

Corresponding U.S. item.
The term
corresponding U.S. item
means the item of U.S. gross income or U.S. loss, if any, that arises from the same transaction or other realization event from which an item of foreign gross income also arises. An item of U.S. gross income or U.S. loss is a corresponding U.S. item even if the item of foreign gross income that arises from the same transaction or realization event differs in amount from the item of U.S. gross income or U.S. loss. A corresponding U.S. item does not include an item of gross income that is exempt, excluded, or eliminated from U.S. gross income, nor does it include an item of U.S. gross income or U.S. loss that is not realized, recognized or taken into account by the taxpayer in the U.S. taxable year in which the taxpayer paid or accrued the foreign income tax, except as provided in the next sentence. If a taxpayer pays or accrues a foreign income tax that is imposed on foreign taxable income that includes an item of foreign gross income by reason of a transaction or other realization event that also gave rise to an item of U.S. gross income or U.S. loss, but the U.S. and foreign taxable years end on different dates and the event occurred in the last U.S. taxable year that ends before the end of the foreign taxable
year, then the item of U.S. gross income or U.S. loss is a corresponding U.S. item.

set forth in section 7701(a)(23).
(c)
General rule.
A foreign income tax (other than certain in lieu of taxes described in paragraph (h) of this section) is allocated and apportioned to the statutory and residual groupings that include the items of foreign gross income included in the base on which the tax is imposed. Each such foreign income tax (that is, each separate levy) is allocated and apportioned separately under the rules in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section. A foreign income tax is allocated and apportioned to or among the statutory and residual groupings under the following steps:
(1) First, by assigning the items of foreign gross income to the groupings under the rules of paragraph (d) of this section;
(2) Second, by allocating and apportioning the deductions that are allowed under foreign law to the foreign gross income in the groupings under the rules of paragraph (e) of this section; and
(3) Third, by allocating and apportioning the foreign income tax by reference to the foreign taxable income in the groupings under the rules of paragraph (f) of this section.
(d)
Assigning items of foreign gross income to the statutory and residual groupings
—(1)
In general.
Each item of foreign gross income is assigned to a statutory or residual grouping. The amount of the item is determined under foreign law. However, Federal income tax law applies to characterize the item and the transaction or other realization event from which the item arose, and to assign it to a grouping. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, if a taxpayer pays or accrues a foreign income tax that is imposed on foreign taxable income that includes an item of foreign gross income with respect to which the taxpayer also realizes, recognizes, or takes into account a corresponding U.S. item, then the item of foreign gross income is assigned to the grouping to which the corresponding U.S. item is assigned. See paragraph (g)(2) of this section (
Example 1
). If the corresponding U.S. item is a U.S. loss (or zero), the foreign gross income is assigned to the grouping to which a gain would be assigned had the transaction or other realization event given rise to a gain, rather than a U.S. loss (or zero), for Federal income tax purposes, and
not (if different) to the grouping to which the U.S. loss is allocated and apportioned in computing U.S. taxable income. Paragraph (d)(3) of this section provides special rules regarding the assignment of the item of foreign gross income in particular circumstances.
(2)
Items of foreign gross income with no corresponding U.S. item
—(i)
In general.
The rules in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section apply for purposes of characterizing an item of foreign gross income and assigning it to a grouping if the taxpayer does not realize, recognize, or take into account a corresponding U.S. item. But see paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(C) and (d)(3)(iii) of this section for special rules with respect to items of foreign gross income attributable to foreign law pass-through income and foreign law inclusion regime income.
(ii)
Foreign gross income from U.S. nonrecognition event, or U.S. recognition event that falls in a different U.S. taxable year
—(A)
In general.
If a taxpayer recognizes an item of foreign gross income arising from a transaction or other foreign realization event that does not result in the recognition of gross income or loss under Federal income tax law in the same U.S. taxable year in which the foreign income tax is paid or accrued or (in the circumstance described in the last sentence of paragraph (b)(2) of this section) in the immediately preceding U.S. taxable year, then the item of foreign gross income is characterized and assigned to the grouping to which the corresponding U.S. item (or the items described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section that are used to assign certain items of foreign gross income to the statutory and residual groupings) would be assigned if the event giving rise to the foreign gross income resulted in the recognition of gross income or loss under Federal income tax law in the U.S. taxable year in which the foreign income tax is paid or accrued.
(B)
Foreign law distributions.
An item of foreign gross income that a taxpayer includes as a result of a foreign law distribution with respect to either stock or a partnership interest is assigned to the same statutory or residual groupings to which the foreign gross income would be assigned if a distribution of property in the amount of the taxable distribution under foreign law were made for Federal income tax purposes on the date on which the foreign law distribution occurred. See paragraph (g)(6) of this section (
Example 5
). See paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section for rules regarding the assignment of foreign gross income arising from a distribution with respect to stock. For purposes of applying paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section to a foreign law distribution, the U.S. dividend amount, U.S. capital gain amount, and U.S. return of capital amount are computed as if the distribution occurred on the date the distribution occurs for foreign law purposes. See § 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii) for rules for assigning foreign gross income arising from a foreign law distribution to income groups or PTEP groups for purposes of section 960 as the operative section, and paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section for rules regarding the assignment of foreign gross income arising from a distribution by a partnership.
(C)
Foreign law dispositions.
A foreign gross income item of gain that a taxpayer includes as a result of a foreign law disposition of property is assigned to the grouping to which a corresponding U.S. item of gain or loss would be assigned on a taxable disposition of the property under Federal income tax law in exchange for an amount equal to the gross receipts or other value used under foreign law to determine the amount of the items of foreign gross income arising from the foreign law disposition in the U.S. taxable year in which the taxpayer paid or accrued the foreign income tax. For example, an item of foreign gross income that results from a deemed disposition of stock under a foreign law mark-to-market regime is assigned under the rules of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) as though a taxable disposition of the stock occurred under Federal income tax law for an amount equal to the fair market value determined under foreign law for purposes of marking the stock to market. See paragraph (g)(3) of this section (
Example 2
).
(D)
Foreign law transfers between taxable units.
This paragraph (d)(2)(ii) applies to an item of foreign gross income arising from an event that foreign law
treats as a transfer of property, or as giving rise to an item of accrued income, gain, deduction, or loss with respect to a transaction, between taxable units (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(E) of this section) of the same taxpayer, and that would be treated as a disregarded payment (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(E) of this section) if the transfer of property occurred, or the item accrued, for Federal income tax purposes in the same U.S. taxable year in which the foreign income tax is paid or accrued. An item of foreign gross income to which this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) applies is characterized and assigned to the grouping to which a disregarded payment in the amount of the item of foreign gross income (or the gross receipts giving rise to the item of foreign gross income) would be assigned under the rules of paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section if the event giving rise to the foreign gross income resulted in a disregarded payment in the U.S. taxable year in which the foreign income tax is paid or accrued. For example, an item of foreign gross income that a taxpayer recognizes by reason of a foreign law distribution (such as a stock dividend or a consent dividend) from a disregarded entity is assigned to the same statutory or residual groupings to which the foreign gross income would be assigned if a distribution of property in the amount of the taxable distribution under foreign law were made for Federal income tax purposes on the date on which the foreign law distribution occurred.
(iii)
Foreign gross income of a type that is recognized but excluded from U.S. gross income
—(A)
In general.
If a taxpayer recognizes an item of foreign gross income that is a type of recognized gross income that Federal income tax law excludes from U.S. gross income, then the item of foreign gross income is assigned to the grouping to which the item of gross income would be assigned if it were included in U.S. gross income. See paragraph (g)(4) of this section (
Example 3
). Notwithstanding the first sentence of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A), foreign gross income that is attributable to a base difference is assigned under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Base differences.
If a taxpayer recognizes an item of foreign gross income that is attributable to a base difference, then the item of foreign gross income is assigned to the residual grouping. But see § 1.904-6(b)(1) (assigning foreign gross income attributable to a base difference to foreign source income in the separate category described in section 904(d)(2)(H)(i)) for purposes of applying section 904 as the operative section). An item of foreign gross income is attributable to a base difference under this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) only if the item results from the receipt of one of the following items:
(
1
) Death benefits described in section 101;
(
2
) Gifts and inheritances described in section 102;
(
3
) Contributions to capital described in section 118;
(
4
) Money or other property in exchange for stock described in section 1032 (including by reason of a transfer described in section 351(a)); or
(
5
) Money or other property in exchange for a partnership interest described in section 721.
(3)
Special rules for assigning certain items of foreign gross income to a statutory or residual grouping
—(i)
Items of foreign gross income that a taxpayer includes by reason of its ownership of an interest in a corporation
—(A)
Scope.
The rules of this paragraph (d)(3)(i) apply to characterize and assign to a statutory or residual grouping an item of foreign gross income that a taxpayer includes in foreign taxable income as a result of its ownership of an interest in a corporation with respect to which there is a distribution under both foreign law and Federal income tax law, an inclusion of foreign law pass-through income, or a disposition under both foreign law and Federal income tax law.
(B)
Foreign gross income items arising from a distribution with respect to a corporation
—(
1
)
In general.
If there is a distribution by a corporation that is treated as a distribution of property for both foreign law and Federal income tax purposes, a taxpayer first applies the rules of paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section, and then (if necessary) applies the rules of paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section to
characterize and assign to the statutory and residual groupings the items of foreign gross income that constitute the foreign dividend amount and the foreign capital gain amount, if any, that arise from the distribution. See paragraph (g)(5) of this section (
Example 4
). For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B), the U.S. dividend amount, U.S. capital gain amount, and U.S. return of capital amount that result from a distribution (including a distribution that occurs on the same date, but in different taxable years, for foreign law purposes and Federal income tax purposes) are computed on the date the distribution occurred for Federal income tax purposes. See paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section for rules for assigning foreign gross income arising from any portion of a distribution that is a foreign law distribution. See § 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii) for rules for assigning foreign gross income arising from a distribution described in this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) to income groups or PTEP groups for purposes of section 960 as the operative section.
(
2
)
Foreign dividend amounts.
The foreign dividend amount is, to the extent of the U.S. dividend amount, assigned to the same statutory and residual grouping (or ratably to the groupings) to which a distribution of the U.S. dividend amount is assigned under Federal income tax law. If the foreign dividend amount exceeds the U.S. dividend amount, the excess foreign dividend amount is an item of foreign gross income that is, to the extent of the U.S. return of capital amount, assigned to the same statutory and residual grouping (or ratably to the groupings) to which earnings of the distributing corporation would be assigned if they were recognized for Federal income tax purposes in the U.S. taxable year in which the distribution is made. These earnings are deemed to arise in the statutory and residual groupings in the same proportions as the proportions in which the tax book value of the stock of the distributing corporation is (or would be if the taxpayer were a United States person) assigned to the groupings under the asset method in § 1.861-9 in the U.S. taxable year in which the distribution is made. Any additional excess of the foreign dividend amount over the sum of the U.S. dividend amount and the U.S. return of capital amount is an item of foreign gross income that is assigned to the statutory or residual grouping (or ratably to the groupings) to which the U.S. capital gain amount is assigned.
(
3
)
Foreign capital gain amounts.
The foreign capital gain amount is, to the extent of the U.S. capital gain amount, assigned to the statutory and residual groupings to which the U.S. capital gain amount is assigned under Federal income tax law. If the foreign capital gain amount exceeds the U.S. capital gain amount, the excess is, to the extent of the U.S. return of capital amount, assigned to the statutory and residual groupings to which earnings equal to the U.S. return of capital amount would be assigned if they were recognized in the U.S. taxable year in which the distribution is made. These earnings are deemed to arise in the statutory and residual groupings in the same proportions as the proportions in which the tax book value of the stock of the distributing corporation is (or would be if the taxpayer were a United States person) assigned under the asset method in § 1.861-9 in the U.S. taxable year in which the distribution is made. Any excess of the foreign capital gain amount over the sum of the U.S. capital gain amount and the U.S. return of capital amount is assigned ratably to the statutory and residual groupings to which the U.S. dividend amount is assigned.
(C)
Foreign law pass-through income from a reverse hybrid.
An item of foreign law pass-through income that a taxpayer includes in its foreign taxable income as a result of its direct or indirect ownership of a reverse hybrid is assigned to a statutory or residual grouping by treating the taxpayer's items of foreign law pass-through income as the foreign gross income of the reverse hybrid, and applying the rules in this paragraph (d) by treating the reverse hybrid as the taxpayer in the reverse hybrid's U.S. taxable year with or within which its foreign taxable year (under the law of the foreign jurisdiction imposing the owner-level tax) ends. See § 1.904-6(f) for special rules that apply for purposes of section 904 with respect to items of foreign gross
income that under this paragraph (d)(3)(iii) would be assigned to a separate category that includes income that gives rise to inclusions under section 951A.
(D)
Foreign gross income items arising from a disposition of stock.
An item of foreign gross income that arises from a transaction that is treated as a sale, exchange, or other disposition for both foreign law and Federal income tax purposes of an interest that is stock in a corporation for Federal income tax purposes is assigned first, to the extent of any U.S. dividend amount that results from the disposition, to the same statutory or residual grouping (or ratably to the groupings) to which the U.S. dividend amount is assigned under Federal income tax law. If the foreign gross income item exceeds the U.S. dividend amount, the foreign gross income item is next assigned, to the extent of the U.S. capital gain amount, to the statutory or residual grouping (or ratably to the groupings) to which the U.S. capital gain amount is assigned under Federal income tax law. Any excess of the foreign gross income item over the sum of the U.S. dividend amount and the U.S. capital gain amount is assigned to the same statutory or residual grouping (or ratably to the groupings) to which earnings equal to such excess amount would be assigned if they were recognized for Federal income tax purposes in the U.S. taxable year in which the disposition occurred. These earnings are deemed to arise in the statutory and residual groupings in the same proportions as the proportions in which the tax book value of the stock is (or would be if the taxpayer were a United States person) assigned to the groupings under the asset method in § 1.861-9 in the U.S. taxable year in which the disposition occurs. See paragraph (g)(10) of this section (
Example 9
).
(ii)
Items of foreign gross income included by a taxpayer by reason of its ownership of an interest in a partnership
—(A)
Scope.
The rules of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) apply to assign to a statutory or residual grouping certain items of foreign gross income that a taxpayer includes in foreign taxable income by reason of its ownership of an interest in a partnership. See paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section for rules that apply in characterizing items of foreign gross income that are attributable to a partner's distributive share of income of a partnership. See paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section for rules that apply in characterizing items of foreign gross income that are attributable to an inclusion under a foreign law inclusion regime.
(B)
Foreign gross income items arising from a distribution with respect to an interest in a partnership.
If a partnership makes a distribution that is treated as a distribution of property for both foreign law and Federal income tax purposes, any foreign gross income item arising from the distribution (including foreign gross income attributable to a distribution from a partnership that foreign law classifies as a dividend from a corporation) is, to the extent of the U.S. capital gain amount arising from the distribution, assigned to the statutory and residual groupings to which the U.S. capital gain amount is assigned under Federal income tax law. If the foreign gross income item arising from the distribution exceeds the U.S. capital gain amount, such excess amount is assigned to the statutory and residual groupings to which a distributive share of income of the partnership in the amount of such excess would be assigned if such income were recognized for Federal income tax purposes in the U.S. taxable year in which the distribution is made. The items constituting this distributive share of income are deemed to arise in the statutory and residual groupings in the same proportions as the proportions in which the tax book value of the partnership interest or the partner's pro rata share of the partnership assets, as applicable, is assigned (or would be assigned if the partner were a United States person) for purposes of apportioning the partner's interest expense under § 1.861-9(e) in the U.S. taxable year in which the distribution is made.
(C)
Foreign gross income items arising from the disposition of an interest in a partnership.
An item of foreign gross income arising from a transaction that is treated as a sale, exchange, or other disposition for both foreign law and
Federal income tax purposes of an interest that is an interest in a partnership for Federal income tax purposes is assigned first, to the extent of the U.S. capital gain amount arising from the disposition, to the statutory or residual grouping (or ratably to the groupings) to which the U.S. capital gain amount is assigned. If the foreign gross income item arising from the disposition exceeds the U.S. capital gain amount, such excess amount is assigned to the statutory and residual grouping (or ratably to the groupings) to which a distributive share of income of the partnership in the amount of such excess would be assigned if such income were recognized for Federal income tax purposes in the U.S. taxable year in which the disposition occurred. The items constituting this distributive share of income are deemed to arise in the statutory and residual groupings in the same proportions as the proportions in which the tax book value of the partnership interest, or the partner's pro rata share of the partnership assets, as applicable, is assigned (or would be assigned if the partner were a United States person) for purposes of apportioning the partner's interest expense under § 1.861-9(e) in the U.S. taxable year in which the disposition occurred.
(iii)
Foreign law inclusion regime income.
A gross item of foreign law inclusion regime income that a taxpayer includes in its capacity as a shareholder under foreign law of a foreign law CFC under a foreign law inclusion regime is assigned to the same statutory and residual groupings as the item of foreign gross income of the foreign law CFC that gives rise to the item of foreign law inclusion regime income of the taxpayer. The assignment is made by treating the gross items of foreign law inclusion regime income of the taxpayer as the items of foreign gross income of the foreign law CFC and applying the rules in this paragraph (d) by treating the foreign law CFC as the taxpayer in its U.S. taxable year with or within which its foreign taxable year (under the law of the foreign jurisdiction imposing the shareholder-level tax) ends. See paragraphs (g)(7) and (8) of this section (
Examples 6
and
7
). See § 1.904-6(f) for special rules with respect to items of foreign gross income relating to items of the foreign law CFC that give rise to inclusions under section 951A for purposes of applying section 904 as the operative section.
(iv)
Gain on sale of disregarded entity.
An item of foreign gross income arising from gain recognized on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of a disregarded entity that is characterized as a disposition of assets for Federal income tax purposes is assigned to statutory and residual groupings in the same proportion as the gain that would be treated as foreign gross income in each grouping if the transaction were treated as a disposition of assets for foreign tax law purposes. See paragraph (g)(9) of this section (
Example 8
).
(v)
Disregarded payments
—(A)
In general.
This paragraph (d)(3)(v) applies to assign to a statutory or residual grouping a foreign gross income item that a taxpayer includes by reason of the receipt of a disregarded payment. In the case of a taxpayer that is an individual or a domestic corporation, this paragraph (d)(3)(v) applies to a disregarded payment made between a taxable unit that is a foreign branch, a foreign branch owner, or a non-branch taxable unit, and another such taxable unit of the same taxpayer. In the case of a taxpayer that is a foreign corporation, this paragraph (d)(3)(v) applies to a disregarded payment made between taxable units that are tested units of the same taxpayer. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(v), an individual or corporation is treated as the taxpayer with respect to its distributive share of foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a partnership, estate, trust or other pass-through entity. The rules of paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B) of this section apply to attribute U.S. gross income comprising the portion of a disregarded payment that is a reattribution payment to a taxable unit, and to associate the foreign gross income item arising from the receipt of the reattribution payment with the statutory and residual groupings to which that U.S. gross income is assigned. The rules of paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C) of this section apply to assign to statutory and residual groupings items of foreign gross income arising from the receipt of the portion of a disregarded payment
that is a remittance or a contribution. The rules of paragraph (d)(3)(v)(D) of this section apply to assign to statutory and residual groupings items of foreign gross income arising from disregarded payments, other than the portions of disregarded payments that are reattribution payments, in connection with disregarded sales or exchanges of property. Paragraph (d)(3)(v)(E) of this section provides definitions that apply for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(v) and paragraph (g) of this section.
(B)
Reattribution payments
—(
1
)
In general.
This paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B) assigns to a statutory or residual grouping a foreign gross income item that a taxpayer includes by reason of the receipt by a taxable unit of the portion of a disregarded payment that is a reattribution payment. The foreign gross income item is assigned to the statutory or residual groupings to which one or more reattribution amounts that constitute the reattribution payment are assigned upon receipt by the taxable unit. If a reattribution payment comprises multiple reattribution amounts and the amount of the foreign gross income item that is attributable to the reattribution payment differs from the amount of the reattribution payment, foreign gross income is apportioned among the statutory and residual groupings in proportion to the reattribution amounts in each statutory and residual grouping. The statutory or residual grouping of a reattribution amount received by a taxable unit is the grouping that includes the U.S. gross income attributed to the taxable unit by reason of its receipt of the gross reattribution amount, regardless of whether, after taking into account disregarded payments made by the taxable unit, the taxable unit has an attribution item as a result of its receipt of the reattribution amount. See paragraph (g)(13) of this section (
Example 12
).
(
2
)
Attribution of U.S. gross income to a taxable unit.
This paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(
2
) provides attribution rules to determine the reattribution amounts received by a taxable unit in the statutory and residual groupings in order to apply paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section to assign foreign gross income items arising from a reattribution payment to the groupings. In the case of a taxpayer that is an individual or a domestic corporation, the attribution rules in § 1.904-4(f)(2) apply to determine the reattribution amounts received by a taxable unit in the separate categories (as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v)) in order to apply paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section for purposes of § 1.904-6(b)(2)(i). In the case of a taxpayer that is a foreign corporation, the attribution rules in § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(ii)(B) apply to determine the reattribution amounts received by a taxable unit in the statutory and residual groupings in order to apply paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section for purposes of §§ 1.951A-2(c)(3), 1.951A-2(c)(7), and 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii). For purposes of other operative sections (as described in § 1.861-8(f)(1)), the principles of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi) or § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(ii)(B), as applicable, apply to determine the reattribution amounts received by a taxable unit in the statutory and residual groupings. The rules and principles of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi) or § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(ii)(B), as applicable, apply to determine the extent to which a disregarded payment made by the taxable unit is a reattribution payment and the reattribution amounts that constitute a reattribution payment, and to adjust the U.S. gross income initially attributed to each taxable unit to reflect the reattribution payments that the taxable unit makes and receives. The rules in this paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(
2
) limit the amount of a disregarded payment that is a reattribution payment to the U.S. gross income of the payor taxable unit that is recognized in the U.S. taxable year in which the disregarded payment is made.
(
3
)
Effect of reattribution payment on foreign gross income items of payor taxable unit.
The statutory or residual grouping to which an item of foreign gross income of a taxable unit is assigned is determined without regard to reattribution payments made by the taxable unit, and without regard to whether the taxable unit has one or more attribution items after taking into account such reattribution payments. No portion of the foreign gross income of the payor taxable unit is treated as foreign gross income of the
payee taxable unit by reason of the reattribution payment, notwithstanding that U.S. gross income of the payor taxable unit that is used to assign foreign gross income of the payor taxable unit to statutory and residual groupings is reattributed to the payee taxable unit under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section by reason of the reattribution payment. See paragraph (e) of this section for rules reducing the amount of a foreign gross income item of a taxable unit by deductions allowed under foreign law, including deductions by reason of disregarded payments made by a taxable unit that are included in the foreign gross income of the payee taxable unit.

Remittances
—(
i
)
In general.
An item of foreign gross income that a taxpayer includes by reason of the receipt of a remittance by a taxable unit is assigned to the statutory or residual groupings of the recipient taxable unit that correspond to the groupings out of which the payor taxable unit made the remittance under the rules of this paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
i
). A remittance paid by a taxable unit is considered to be made ratably out of all of the accumulated after-tax income of the taxable unit. The accumulated after-tax income of the taxable unit that pays the remittance is deemed to have arisen in the statutory and residual groupings in the same proportions as the proportions in which the tax book value of the assets of the taxable unit are (or would be if the owner of the taxable unit were a United States person) assigned for purposes of apportioning interest expense under the asset method in § 1.861-9 in the taxable year in which the remittance is made. See paragraph (g)(11) and (12) of this section (
Examples 10
and
11
). If the payor taxable unit is determined to have no assets under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section, then the foreign gross income that is included by reason of the receipt of the remittance is assigned to the residual grouping.
(
ii
)
Assets of a taxable unit.
The assets of a taxable unit are determined in accordance with § 1.987-6(b), except that for purposes of applying § 1.987-6(b)(2) under this paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
ii
), a taxable unit is deemed to be a section 987 QBU (within the meaning of § 1.987-1(b)(2)) and assets of the taxable unit include stock held by the taxable unit, the portion of the tax book value of a reattribution asset that is assigned to the taxable unit, and the taxable unit's pro rata share of the assets of another taxable unit (other than a corporation or a partnership), including the portion of any reattribution assets assigned to the other taxable unit, in which it owns an interest. If a taxable unit owns an interest in a taxable unit that is a partnership, the assets of the taxable unit that is the owner include its interest in the partnership or its pro rata share of the partnership assets, as applicable, determined under the principles of § 1.861-9(e). The portion of the tax book value of a reattribution asset that is assigned to a taxable unit is an amount that bears the same ratio to the total tax book value of the reattribution asset as the sum of the attribution items of that taxable unit arising from gross income produced by the reattribution asset bears to the total gross income produced by the reattribution asset. The portion of a reattribution asset that is assigned to a taxable unit under this paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
ii
) is not treated as an asset of the taxable unit making the reattribution payment for purposes of applying paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
i
) of this section.
(
2
)
Contributions.
An item of foreign gross income that a taxpayer includes by reason of the receipt of a contribution by a taxable unit is assigned to the residual grouping. See, however, § 1.904-6(b)(2)(ii) (assigning certain items of foreign gross income to the foreign branch category for purposes of applying section 904 as the operative section).
(
3
)
Disregarded payment that comprises both a reattribution payment and a remittance or contribution.
If both a reattribution payment and either a remittance or a contribution result from a single disregarded payment, the foreign gross income is first attributed to the portion of the disregarded payment that is a reattribution payment to the extent of the amount of the reattribution payment, and any excess of the foreign gross income item over the
amount of the reattribution payment is then to attributed to the portion of the disregarded payment that is a remittance or contribution.
(D)
Disregarded payments in connection with disregarded sales or exchanges of property.
An item of foreign gross income that is attributable to gain recognized under foreign law by reason of a disregarded payment, other than the portion of the disregarded payment that is a reattribution payment, received in exchange for property is characterized and assigned under the rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. See paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B) of this section for rules for assigning an item of foreign gross income attributable to the portion of a disregarded payment that is a reattribution payment, including a reattribution payment received in exchange for property.

Foreign gross income included by reason of U.S. equity hybrid instrument ownership
—(A)
Foreign gross income included by reason of an accrual.
Foreign gross income included by reason of an accrual under foreign law with respect to a U.S. equity hybrid instrument is considered to arise from the same transaction or realization event as a distribution of property described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section and is assigned to the statutory and residual groupings by treating each amount accrued as a foreign law distribution made on the date of the accrual under foreign law.
(B)
Foreign gross income included by reason of a payment.
Foreign gross income included by reason of a payment of interest under foreign law with respect to a U.S. equity hybrid instrument is considered to arise from the same transaction or realization event as a distribution of property described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section and is assigned to the statutory and residual groupings by treating each payment as a distribution made on the date of the payment.
(e)
Allocating and apportioning deductions (allowed under foreign law) to foreign gross income in a grouping
—(1)
Application of foreign law expense allocation rules.
In order to determine foreign taxable income in each statutory grouping, or the residual grouping, foreign gross income in each grouping is reduced by deducting any expenses, losses, or other amounts that are deductible under foreign law that are specifically allocable to the items of foreign gross income in the grouping under the laws of that foreign country. If expenses are not specifically allocated under foreign law, then the expenses are allocated and apportioned among the groupings under the principles of foreign law. Thus, for example, if foreign law provides that expenses will be apportioned on a gross income basis, the foreign law deductions are apportioned on the basis of the relative amounts of foreign gross income assigned to each grouping.
(2)
Application of U.S. expense allocation rules in the absence of foreign law rules.
If foreign law does not provide rules for the allocation or apportionment of expenses, losses or other deductions to particular items of foreign gross income, then the principles of the section 861 regulations (as defined in § 1.861-8(a)(1)) apply in allocating and apportioning such expenses, losses, or other deductions to foreign gross income. For example, in the absence of foreign law expense allocation rules, the principles of the section 861 regulations apply to allocate definitely related expenses to particular categories of foreign gross income and provide the methods for apportioning foreign law expenses that are definitely related to more than one statutory grouping or that are not definitely related to any statutory grouping. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2), the apportionment of expenses required to be made under the principles of the section 861 regulations need not be made on other than a separate company basis. If the taxpayer applies the principles of the section 861 regulations for purposes of allocating foreign law deductions under this paragraph (e), the taxpayer must apply the principles in the same manner as the taxpayer applies such principles in determining the income or earnings and profits for Federal income tax purposes of the taxpayer (or of the foreign branch, controlled foreign corporation, or other entity that paid or accrued the foreign taxes, as the case may be). For example, a taxpayer must use the modified gross income method under § 1.861-9T when applying the principles of that section for purposes of this paragraph (e) to determine the amount of foreign taxable income in each grouping if the taxpayer applies the modified gross income method in determining the income and earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation for Federal income tax purposes.
(f)
Allocation and apportionment of foreign income tax.
Foreign income tax is allocated to the statutory or residual grouping or groupings to which the items of foreign gross income are assigned under the rules of paragraph (d) of this section. If foreign gross income is assigned to more than one grouping, then the foreign income tax is apportioned among the statutory and residual groupings by multiplying the foreign income tax by a fraction, the numerator of which is the foreign taxable income in a grouping and the denominator of which is all foreign taxable income on which the foreign income tax is imposed. If foreign law, including by reason of an income tax convention, exempts certain types of income from tax, or if foreign taxable income is reduced to or below zero by foreign law deductions, then no foreign income tax is allocated and apportioned to that income. A withholding tax (as defined in section 901(k)(1)(B)) is allocated and apportioned to the foreign gross income from which it is withheld. If foreign law, including by reason of an income tax convention, provides for a specific rate of tax with respect to certain types of income (for example, capital gains), or allows credits only against tax on particular items or types of income (for example, credit for foreign withholding taxes), then such provisions are taken into account in determining the amount of foreign tax imposed on such foreign taxable income.
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section and § 1.904-6.
(1)
Presumed facts.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (g), the following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples in paragraphs (g)(2) through (9) of this section:
(i) USP and US2 are domestic corporations, which are unrelated;
(ii) USP elects to claim a foreign tax credit under section 901;
(iii) CFC, CFC1, and CFC2 are controlled foreign corporations organized in Country A, and are not reverse hybrids;
(iv) All parties have a U.S. dollar functional currency and a U.S. taxable year and foreign taxable year that correspond to the calendar year;
(v) No party has expenses for Country A tax purposes or expenses for U.S. tax purposes (other than foreign income tax expense); and
(vi) Section 904 is the operative section, and terms have the meaning provided in this section or §§ 1.904-4 and 1.904-5.
(2)
Example 1: Corresponding U.S. item
—(i)
Facts.
USP conducts business in Country A that gives rise to a foreign branch (as defined in § 1.904-4(f)(3)). In Year 1, in a transaction that is a sale for purposes of the laws of Country A and Federal income tax law, the foreign branch transfers Asset X to US2 for $1,000x. For Country A tax purposes, USP earns $600x of gross income from the sale of Asset X and incurs foreign income tax of $80x. For Federal income tax purposes, USP earns $800x of foreign branch category income from the sale of Asset X.
(ii)
Analysis.
For purposes of allocating and apportioning the $80x of Country A foreign income tax, the $600x of Country A gross income from the sale of Asset X is first assigned to separate categories. The $800x of foreign branch category income from the sale of Asset X is the corresponding U.S. item to the Country A item of gross income. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, because USP recognizes a corresponding U.S. item with respect to the Country A item of gross income in the same U.S. taxable year, the $600x of Country A gross income is assigned to the same separate category as the corresponding U.S. item. This is the case even though the amount of gross income recognized for Federal income tax purposes differs from the amount recognized for Country A tax purposes. Accordingly, the $600x of Country A gross income is assigned to the foreign branch category. Additionally, because all of the Country A taxable income is assigned to a single separate category, the $80x of Country A tax is also allocated to the foreign branch category. No apportionment of the $80x is necessary because the class of gross income to which the tax is allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping, foreign branch category income.
(3)
Example 2: Foreign law disposition
—(i)
Facts.
USP owns all of the outstanding stock of CFC, which conducts business in Country A. CFC sells Asset X for $1,000x. For Country A tax purposes, CFC's basis in Asset X is $600x, the sale of Asset X occurs in Year 1, and CFC recognizes $400x of foreign gross income and incurs $80x of foreign income tax. For Federal income tax purposes, CFC's basis in Asset X is $500x, the sale of Asset X occurs in Year 2, and CFC recognizes $500x of general category income.
(ii)
Analysis.
For purposes of allocating and apportioning the $80x of Country A foreign income tax in Year 1, the $400x of Country A gross income from the sale of Asset X is first assigned to separate categories. There is no corresponding U.S. item because the sale occurs on a different date and in a different U.S. taxable year for U.S. and foreign tax purposes. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the item of foreign gross income (the $400x from the sale of Asset X) is characterized and assigned to the groupings to which the corresponding U.S. item would be assigned if for Federal income tax purposes Asset X were sold for $1,000x in Year 1, the same U.S. taxable year in which the foreign income tax accrued. This is the case even though the amount of gross income that would be recognized for Federal income tax purposes differs from the amount recognized for Country A tax purposes. Accordingly, the $400x of Country A gross income is assigned to the general category. Additionally, because all of the Country A taxable income is assigned to a single separate category, the $80x of Country A tax is also allocated to the general category. No apportionment of the $80x is necessary because the class of gross income to which the deduction is allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping, general category income.
(4)
Example 3: Foreign gross income excluded from U.S. gross income
—(i)
Facts.
USP conducts business in Country A. In Year 1, USP earns $200x of interest income on a State or local bond. For Country A tax purposes, the $200x of income is included in gross income and incurs $10x of foreign income tax. For Federal income tax purposes, the $200x is excluded from gross income under section 103.
(ii)
Analysis.
For purposes of allocating and apportioning the $10x of Country A foreign income tax, the $200x of Country A gross income is first assigned to separate categories. There is no corresponding U.S. item because the interest income is excluded from U.S. gross income. Thus, the rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply to characterize and assign the foreign gross income to the groupings to which a corresponding U.S. item would be assigned if it were recognized under Federal income tax law in that U.S. taxable year. The interest income is excluded from U.S. gross income but is otherwise described or identified by section 103. Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the $200x of Country A gross income is assigned to the separate category to which the interest income would be assigned under Federal income tax law if the income were included in gross income. Under section 904(d)(2)(B)(i), the interest income would be passive category income. Accordingly, the $200x of Country A gross income is assigned to the passive category. Additionally, because all of the Country A taxable income is assigned to a single separate category, the $10x of Country A tax is also allocated to the passive category (subject to the rules in § 1.904-4(c)). No apportionment of the $10x is necessary because the class of gross income to which the deduction is allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping, passive category income.
(5)
Example 4: Actual distribution
—(1)
Facts.
USP owns all of the outstanding stock of CFC1, which in turn owns all of the outstanding stock of CFC2. CFC1 and CFC2 conduct business in Country A. In Year 1, CFC2 distributes $300x to CFC1. For Country A tax purposes, $100x of the distribution is the foreign dividend amount, $160x is treated as a nontaxable return of capital, and the remaining $40x is the foreign capital gain amount. CFC1 incurs $20x of foreign income tax with respect to the foreign dividend amount and $4x of foreign income tax with respect to the foreign capital gain amount. The $20x and $4x of foreign income tax are each a separate levy within the meaning of
§ 1.901-2(d). For Federal income tax purposes, $150x of the distribution is the U.S. dividend amount, $100x is the U.S. return of capital amount, and the remaining $50x is the U.S. capital gain amount. Under section 904(d)(3)(D) and §§ 1.904-4(d) and 1.904-5(c)(4), the $150x of U.S. dividend amount consists solely of general category income in the hands of CFC1. Under section 904(d)(2)(B)(i) and § 1.904-4(b)(2)(i)(A), the $50x of U.S. capital gain amount is passive category income to CFC1.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
In general.
Because the $20x of Country A foreign income tax and the $4x of Country A foreign income tax are separate levies, the taxes are allocated and apportioned separately. For purposes of allocating and apportioning each foreign income tax, the relevant item of Country A gross income (the foreign dividend amount or foreign capital gain amount) is first assigned to separate categories. The U.S. dividend amount and U.S. capital gain amount are corresponding U.S. items. However, paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section (and not paragraph (d)(1) of this section) applies to assign the items of foreign gross income arising from the distribution.
(B)
Foreign dividend amount.
Under paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section, the foreign dividend amount ($100x) is, to the extent of the U.S. dividend amount ($150x), assigned to the same separate category from which the distribution of the U.S. dividend amount is made under Federal income tax law. Thus, $100x of foreign gross income that is the foreign dividend amount is assigned to the general category. Additionally, because all of the Country A taxable income included in the base on which the $20x of foreign income tax is imposed is assigned to a single separate category, the $20x of Country A tax on the foreign dividend amount is also allocated to the general category. No apportionment of the $20x is necessary because the class of gross income to which the deduction for foreign income tax is allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping, general category income. See also section 245A(d) for rules that may apply to disallow a credit or deduction for certain foreign taxes.
(C)
Foreign capital gain amount.
Under paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section, the foreign capital gain amount ($40x) is, to the extent of the U.S. capital gain amount ($50x), assigned to the same separate category to which the U.S. capital gain is assigned under Federal income tax law. Thus, the $40x of foreign gross income that is the foreign capital gain amount is assigned to the passive category. Additionally, because all of the Country A taxable income in the base on which the $4x of foreign income tax is imposed is assigned to a single separate category, the $4x of Country A tax on the foreign dividend amount is also allocated to the passive category. No apportionment of the $4x is necessary because the class of gross income to which the deduction is allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping, passive category income.
(6)
Example 5: Foreign law distribution
—(i)
Facts.
USP owns all of the outstanding stock of CFC. In Year 1, for Country A tax purposes, CFC distributes $1,000x of its stock that is treated entirely as a dividend to USP, and Country A imposes a withholding tax on USP of $150x with respect to the $1,000x of foreign gross income. For Federal income tax purposes, the distribution is treated as a stock dividend described in section 305(a) and USP recognizes no U.S. gross income. At the time of the distribution, CFC has $800x of section 965(a) PTEP (as defined in § 1.960-3(c)(2)(vi)) in a single annual PTEP account (as defined in § 1.960-3(c)(1)), and $500x of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3). Section 965(g) is the operative section for purposes of this paragraph (g)(6). See § 1.965-5(b)(2). Section 904 is also a relevant operative section, but is not addressed in this paragraph (g)(6).
(ii)
Analysis.
For purposes of allocating and apportioning the $150x of Country A foreign income tax, the $1,000x of Country A gross income is first assigned to the relevant statutory and residual groupings for purposes of applying section 965(g) as the operative section. Under § 1.965-5(b)(2), the statutory grouping is the portion of the distribution that is attributable to section 965(a) previously taxed earnings and profits and the residual grouping is
the portion of the distribution attributable to other earnings and profits. There is no corresponding U.S. item because under section 305(a) USP recognizes no U.S. gross income with respect to the distribution. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the item of foreign gross income (the $1,000x distribution) is assigned under the rules of paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section to the same statutory or residual groupings to which the foreign gross income would be assigned if a distribution of the same amount were made for Federal income tax purposes in Year 1 on the date the distribution occurs for foreign law purposes. If recognized for Federal income tax purposes, a $1,000x distribution in Year 1 would result in a U.S. dividend amount of $1,000x. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section, the foreign dividend amount ($1,000x) is, to the extent of the U.S. dividend amount ($1,000x), assigned to the same statutory or residual groupings from which a distribution of the U.S. dividend amount would be made under Federal income tax law. Thus, $800x of foreign gross income related to the foreign dividend amount is assigned to the statutory grouping for the portion of the distribution attributable to section 965(a) previously taxed earnings and profits and $200x of foreign gross income is assigned to the residual grouping. Under paragraph (f) of this section, $120x ($150x × $800x/$1,000x) of the Country A foreign income tax is apportioned to the statutory grouping and $30x ($150x × $200x/$1,000x) of the Country A foreign income tax is apportioned to the residual grouping. See section 965(g)(2) and § 1.965-5(b) for application of the applicable percentage (as defined in § 1.965-5(d)) to the foreign income tax allocated and apportioned to the statutory grouping.

Example 6: Foreign law inclusion regime, CFC shareholder
—(i)
Facts.
USP owns all of the outstanding stock of CFC1, which in turn owns all of the outstanding stock of CFC2. CFC2 is organized and conducts business in Country B. Country A has a foreign law inclusion regime that imposes a tax on CFC1 for certain earnings of CFC2, a foreign law CFC. In Year 1, CFC2 earns $400x of interest income and $200x of royalty income. CFC2 incurs no foreign income tax. For Country A tax purposes, the $400x of interest income and $200x of royalty income are each an item of foreign law inclusion regime income of CFC2 that are included in the gross income of CFC1. CFC1 incurs $150x of Country A foreign income tax with respect to the foreign law inclusion regime income. For Federal income tax purposes, with respect to CFC2, the $400x of interest income is passive category income under section 904(d)(2)(B)(i) and the $200x of royalty income is general category income under § 1.904-4(b)(2)(iii).
(ii)
Analysis.
For purposes of allocating and apportioning CFC1's $150x of Country A foreign income tax, the $600x of Country A gross income is first assigned to separate categories. The $600x of foreign gross income is not included in the U.S. gross income of CFC1, and thus, there is no corresponding U.S. item. Under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, each item of foreign law inclusion regime income that is included in CFC1's foreign gross income is assigned to the same separate category as the items of foreign gross income of CFC2 that give rise to the foreign law inclusion regime income of CFC1. With respect to CFC2, the $400x of interest income and the $200x of royalty income would be corresponding U.S. items if CFC2 were the taxpayer. Accordingly, $400x of CFC1's foreign gross income is assigned to the passive category and $200x of CFC1's foreign gross income is assigned to the general category. Under paragraph (f) of this section, $100x ($150x × $400x/$600x) of the Country A foreign income tax is apportioned to the passive category and $50x ($150x × $200x/$600x) of the Country A foreign income tax is apportioned to the general category.
(8)
Example 7: Foreign law inclusion regime, U.S. shareholder
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 6
), except that both CFC1 and CFC2 are organized and conduct business in Country B, all of the outstanding stock of CFC1 is owned by Individual X, a U.S. citizen resident in Country A, and Country A imposes tax of $150x on foreign gross income of $600x under its foreign law inclusion regime on Individual X, rather than on
CFC1. For Federal income tax purposes, in the hands of CFC2, the $400x of interest income is passive category subpart F income and the $200x of royalty income is general category tested income (as defined in § 1.951A-2(b)(1)). CFC2's $400x of interest income gives rise to a passive category subpart F inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A), and its $200x of tested income gives rise to a GILTI inclusion amount (as defined in § 1.951A-1(c)(1)) of $200x, with respect to Individual X.
(ii)
Analysis.
The analysis is the same as in paragraph (g)(7)(ii) of this section (the analysis in
Example 6
) except that under § 1.904-6(f), because $50x of the Country A foreign income tax is allocated and apportioned under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section to CFC2's general category tested income group to which Individual X's inclusion under section 951A is attributable, the $50x of Country A foreign income tax is allocated and apportioned in the hands of Individual X to the section 951A category.

Example 8: Sale of disregarded entity
—(i)
Facts.
USP sells FDE, a disregarded entity that is organized and operates a trade or business in Country A, for $500x. FDE owns Asset X and Asset Y in Country A, each having a fair market value of $250x. For Country A tax purposes, FDE has a basis in Asset X of $100x and a basis in Asset Y of $200x, USP's basis in FDE is $100x, and the sale is treated as a sale of stock. Country A imposes foreign income tax of $40x on USP on the Country A gross income of $400x resulting from the sale of FDE, based on its rules for taxing capital gains of nonresidents selling stock of companies operating a trade or business in Country A. For Federal income tax purposes, USP has a basis of $150x in each of Assets X and Y, and so the sale of FDE results in $100x of passive category income with respect to the sale of Asset X and $100x of general category income with respect to the sale of Asset Y.
(ii)
Analysis.
For purposes of allocating and apportioning USP's $40x of Country A foreign income tax, the $400x of Country A gross income resulting from the sale of FDE is first assigned to separate categories. Under paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section, USP's $400x of Country A gross income is assigned among the statutory groupings in the same percentages as the foreign gross income in each grouping that would have resulted if the sale of FDE were treated as an asset sale for Country A tax purposes. Because for Country A tax purposes Asset X had a built-in gain of $150x and Asset Y had a built-in gain of $50x, $300x ($400x × $150x/$200x) of the Country A gross income is assigned to the passive category and $100x ($400x × $50x/$200x) is assigned to the general category. Under paragraph (f) of this section, $30x ($40x × $300x/$400x) of the Country A foreign income tax is apportioned to the passive category, and $10x ($40x × $100x/$400x) of the Country A foreign income tax is apportioned to the general category.
(10)
Example 9: Gain on disposition of stock
—(i)
Facts.
USP owns all of the outstanding stock of CFC, which conducts business in Country A. In Year 1, USP sells all of the stock of CFC to US2 for $1,000x. For Country A tax purposes, USP's basis in the stock of CFC is $200x. Accordingly, USP recognizes $800x of gain on which Country A imposes $80x of foreign income tax based on its rules for taxing capital gains of nonresidents, which satisfy the requirement in § 1.901-2(b)(5)(i)(C). For Federal income tax purposes, USP's basis in the stock of CFC is $400x. Accordingly, USP recognizes $600x of gain on the sale of the stock of CFC, of which $150x is included in the gross income of USP as a dividend under section 1248(a) that, as provided in section 1248(j), is treated as a dividend eligible for the deduction under section 245A(a). Under paragraphs (b)(20) and (21) of this section, respectively, the sale of CFC stock by USP gives rise to a $450x U.S. capital gain amount and a $150x U.S. dividend amount. Under §§ 1.904-4(d) and 1.904-5(c)(4), the $150x U.S. dividend amount is general category section 245A subgroup income, and the $450x U.S. capital gain amount is passive category income to USP. For purposes of allocating and apportioning its interest expense under §§ 1.861-9(g)(2)(i)(B) and 1.861-13, USP's stock in CFC is characterized as general category stock in the section 245A subgroup.
(ii)
Analysis.
For purposes of allocating and apportioning the $80x of Country A foreign income tax, the $800x of Country A gross income from the sale of the stock of CFC is first assigned to separate categories. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i)(D) of this section, the $800x of Country A gross income is first assigned to the separate category to which the $150x U.S. dividend amount is assigned, to the extent thereof, and is next assigned to the separate category to which the $450x U.S. capital gain amount is assigned, to the extent thereof. Accordingly, $150x of Country A gross income is assigned to the general category in the section 245A subgroup, and $450x of Country A gross income is assigned to the passive category. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i)(D) of this section, the remaining $200x of Country A gross income is assigned to the statutory and residual groupings to which earnings of CFC in that amount would be assigned if they were recognized for Federal income tax purposes in the U.S. taxable year in which the disposition occurred. These earnings are all deemed to arise in the section 245A subgroup of the general category, based on USP's characterization of its stock in CFC. Thus, under paragraph (d)(3)(i)(D) of this section the $800x of foreign gross income, and therefore the foreign taxable income, is characterized as $350x ($150x + $200x) of income in the general category section 245A subgroup and $450x of income in the passive category. This is the result even though for Country A tax purposes all $800x of Country A gross income is characterized as gain from the sale of stock, which would be passive category income under section 904(d)(2)(B)(i), because the income is assigned to a separate category based on the characterization of the gain under Federal income tax law. Under paragraph (f) of this section, the $80x of Country A tax is ratably apportioned between the general category section 245A subgroup and the passive category based on the relative amounts of foreign taxable income in each grouping. Accordingly, $35x ($80x × $350x/$800x) of the Country A tax is apportioned to the general category section 245A subgroup, and $45x ($80x × $450x/$800x) of the Country A tax is apportioned to the passive category. See also § 1.245A(d)-1 for rules that may disallow a credit or deduction for the $35x of Country A tax apportioned to the general category section 245A subgroup.

Example 10: Disregarded transfer of built-in gain property
—(i)
Facts.
USP owns FDE, a disregarded entity that is treated for Federal income tax purposes as a foreign branch operating in Country A. FDE transfers Asset F, equipment used in FDE's trade or business in Country A, for no consideration to USP in a transaction that is a remittance described in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(E) of this section for Federal income tax purposes but is treated as a distribution of Asset F from a corporation to its shareholder, USP, for Country A tax purposes. At the time of the transfer, Asset F has a fair market value of $250x and an adjusted basis of $100x for both Federal and Country A income tax purposes. Country A imposes $30x of tax on FDE with respect to the $150x of built-in gain on a deemed sale of Asset F, which is recognized for Country A tax purposes by reason of the transfer to USP. If FDE had sold Asset F for $250x in a transaction that was regarded for Federal income tax purposes, FDE would also have recognized gain of $150x for Federal income tax purposes, and that gain would have been characterized as foreign branch category income under § 1.904-4(f). Country A also imposes $25x of withholding tax, a separate levy, on USP by reason of the distribution of Asset F to USP.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Net income tax on built-in gain.
For purposes of allocating and apportioning the $30x of Country A foreign income tax imposed on FDE by reason of the transfer of Asset F to USP for Country A tax purposes, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section the $150x of Country A gross income is first assigned to a separate category. Because the transfer does not result in a deemed sale for Federal income tax purposes, there is no corresponding U.S. item. However, FDE would have recognized gain of $150x, which would have been the corresponding U.S. item, if the deemed sale had been recognized for Federal income tax purposes. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the $150x item of foreign
gross income is characterized and assigned to the grouping to which such corresponding U.S. item would have been assigned if the deemed sale were recognized under Federal income tax law. Because the sale of Asset F in a regarded transaction would have resulted in foreign branch category income, the foreign gross income is characterized as foreign branch category income. Under paragraph (f) of this section, the $30x of Country A tax is also allocated to the foreign branch category, the statutory grouping to which the $150x of Country A gross income is assigned. No apportionment of the $30x of Country A tax is necessary because the class of gross income to which the foreign gross income is allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping.
(B)
Withholding tax on distribution.
For purposes of allocating and apportioning the $25x of Country A withholding tax imposed on USP by reason of the transfer of Asset F, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section the $250x of Country A gross income arising from the transfer of Asset F is first assigned to a separate category. For Federal income tax purposes, the transfer of Asset F is a remittance from FDE to USP, and thus there is no corresponding U.S. item. Under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
i
) of this section, the item of foreign gross income is assigned to the groupings to which the income out of which the payment is made is assigned; the payment is considered to be made ratably out of all of the accumulated after-tax income of FDE, as computed for Federal income tax purposes; and the accumulated after-tax income of FDE is deemed to have arisen in the statutory and residual groupings in the same proportions as those in which the tax book value of FDE's assets in the groupings, determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section, are assigned for purposes of apportioning USP's interest expense. Because all of FDE's assets produce foreign branch category income, under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
) of this section the foreign gross income is characterized as foreign branch category income. Under paragraph (f) of this section, the $25x of Country A withholding tax is also allocated entirely to the foreign branch category, the statutory grouping to which the $250x of Country A gross income is assigned. No apportionment of the $25x is necessary because the class of gross income to which the foreign gross income is allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping.

Example 11: Disregarded payment that is a remittance
—(i)
Facts.
USP wholly owns CFC1, which is a tested unit within the meaning of § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(iv)(A) (the “CFC1 tested unit”). CFC1 wholly owns FDE, a disregarded entity that is organized in Country B, which is a tested unit within the meaning of § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(iv)(A) (the “FDE tested unit”). The sole assets of FDE (determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section) are all the outstanding stock of CFC3, a controlled foreign corporation organized in Country B. In Year 1, CFC3 pays a $400x dividend to FDE that is excluded from CFC1's foreign personal holding company income (“FPHCI”) by reason of section 954(c)(6). FDE makes no payments to CFC1 and pays no Country B tax in Year 1. In Year 2, FDE makes a $400x remittance to CFC1 as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(E) of this section. Under the laws of Country B, the remittance gives rise to a $400x dividend. Country B imposes a 5% ($20x) withholding tax (which is an eligible current year tax as defined in § 1.960-1(b)) on CFC1 on the dividend. In Year 2, CFC3 pays no dividends to FDE, and FDE earns no income. For Federal income tax purposes, the $400x payment from FDE to CFC1 is a disregarded payment and results in no income to CFC1. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(12) (
Example 11
), section 960(a) is the operative section and the income groups described in § 1.960-1(d)(2) are the statutory and residual groupings. See § 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii)(A) (applying § 1.960-1 to allocate and apportion current year taxes to income groups). For Federal income tax purposes, in Year 2 the stock of CFC3 owned by FDE has a tax book value of $1,000x, $750x of which is assigned under the asset method in § 1.861-9 (as applied by treating CFC1 as a United States person) to the general category tested income group described in § 1.960-
1(d)(2)(ii)(C), and $250x of which is assigned to a passive category FPHCI group described in § 1.960-1(d)(2)(ii)(B)(

(ii)
Analysis.
(A) The $20x Country B withholding tax on the Year 2 remittance from FDE is imposed on a $400x item of foreign gross income that CFC1 includes in foreign gross income by reason of its receipt of a disregarded payment. In order to allocate and apportion the $20x of Country B withholding tax under paragraph (c) of this section for purposes of § 1.960-1(d)(3)(ii)(A), paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section applies to assign the $400x item of foreign gross dividend income to a statutory or residual grouping. Under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
) of this section, the $400x item of foreign gross income is assigned to the statutory or residual groupings of the CFC1 tested unit that correspond to the statutory and residual groupings out of which FDE made the remittance.
(B) Under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
i
) of this section, FDE is considered to have made the remittance ratably out of all of its accumulated after-tax income, which is deemed to have arisen in the statutory and residual groupings in the same proportions as the proportions in which the tax book value of FDE's assets would be assigned (if CFC1 were a United States person) for purposes of apportioning interest expense under the asset method in Year 2, the taxable year in which FDE made the remittance. Accordingly, $300x ($400x × $750x/$1,000x) of the remittance is deemed made out of the general category tested income of the FDE tested unit, and $100x ($400x × $250x/$1,000x) of the remittance is deemed made out of the passive category FPHCI of the FDE tested unit.
(C) Under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
i
) of this section, $300x of the $400x item of foreign gross income from the remittance, and therefore an equal amount of foreign taxable income, is assigned to the income group that includes general category tested income attributable to the CFC1 tested unit, and $100x of this foreign gross income item, and therefore an equal amount of foreign taxable income, is assigned to the income group that includes passive category FPHCI attributable to the CFC1 tested unit. Under paragraph (f) of this section, the $20x of Country B withholding tax is ratably apportioned between the income groups based on the relative amounts of foreign taxable income in each grouping. Accordingly, $15x ($20x × $300x/$400x) of the Country B withholding tax is apportioned to the CFC1 tested unit's general category tested income group, and $5x ($20x × $100x/$400x) of the Country B withholding tax is apportioned to the CFC1 tested unit's passive category FPHCI income group. See § 1.960-2 for rules on determining the amount of such taxes that may be deemed paid under section 960(a) and (d).

Example 12: Disregarded payment that is a reattribution payment
—(i)
Facts.
(A) USP wholly owns CFC1, a tested unit within the meaning of § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(iv)(A)(
1
) (the “CFC1 tested unit”). CFC1 wholly owns FDE1, a disregarded entity organized in Country B, that is a tested unit within the meaning of § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(iv)(A)(
2
) (the “FDE1 tested unit”). Country B imposes a 20 percent net income tax on its residents. CFC1 also wholly owns FDE2, a disregarded entity organized in Country C, that is a tested unit within the meaning of § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(iv)(A)(
2
) (the “FDE2 tested unit”). Country C imposes a 15 percent net income tax on its residents. The net income tax imposed by each of Country B and Country C on their tax residents is a foreign income tax within the meaning of § 1.901-2(a) and a separate levy within the meaning of § 1.901-2(d). For purposes of this paragraph (g)(13) (
Example 12
), the operative section is the high-tax exclusion of section 951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(III) and § 1.951A-2(c)(7), and the statutory groupings are the tested income groups of each tested unit, as defined in § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(iv)(A).
(B) FDE2 owns Asset A, which is intangible property with a tax book value of $12,000x that is properly reflected on the separate set of books and records of FDE2. In Year 1, pursuant to a license agreement between FDE1 and FDE2 for the use of Asset A, FDE1 makes a disregarded royalty payment to FDE2 of $1,000x that would be deductible if regarded for Federal income tax purposes. Because it is disregarded
for Federal income tax purposes, the $1,000x disregarded royalty payment by FDE1 to FDE2 results in no income to CFC1 for Federal income tax purposes. Also, in Year 1, pursuant to a sub-license agreement between FDE1 and an unrelated third party for the use of Asset A, FDE1 earns $1,200x of royalty income for Federal income tax purposes (the “U.S. gross royalty”) for the use of Asset A. The $1,200 of royalty income received by FDE1 from the unrelated third party is excluded from CFC1's foreign personal holding company income by reason of the active business exception in section 954(c)(2) because CFC1 satisfies the requirements of § 1.954-2(d)(1). As a result, the $1,200x of royalty income that FDE1 earns from the sub-license agreement is gross tested income (as defined in § 1.951A-2(c)(1)), which is properly reflected on the separate set of books and records of FDE1.
(C) Under the laws of Country B, the transaction that gives rise to the $1,200x item of U.S. gross royalty income causes FDE1 to include a $1,200x item of gross royalty income in its Country B taxable income (the “Country B gross royalty”). In addition, FDE1 deducts its $1,000x disregarded royalty payment to FDE2 for Country B tax purposes. For Country B tax purposes, FDE1 therefore has $200x ($1,200x−$1,000x) of taxable income on which Country B imposes $40x (20% × $200x) of net income tax.
(D) Under the laws of Country C, the $1,000x disregarded royalty payment from FDE1 to FDE2 causes FDE2 to include a $1,000x item of gross royalty income in its Country C taxable income (the “Country C gross royalty”). FDE2 therefore has $1,000x of taxable income for Country C tax purposes, on which Country C imposes $150x (15% × $1,000x) of net income tax.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Country B net income tax.
(
1
) The Country B net income tax is imposed on foreign taxable income of FDE1 that consists of a $1,200x item of Country B gross royalty income and a $1,000x item of royalty expense. For Federal income tax purposes, the FDE1 tested unit has a $1,200x item of U.S. gross royalty income that is initially attributable to it under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(
2
) of this section and § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(ii)(B). The transaction that produced the $1,200x item of U.S. gross royalty income also produced the $1,200x item of Country B gross royalty income. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $1,200x item of U.S. gross royalty income is therefore the corresponding U.S. item for the $1,200x item of Country B gross royalty income of FDE1.
(
2
) The $1,000x disregarded royalty payment from FDE1 to FDE2 is allocated under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(
2
) of this section and § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(ii)(B) to the $1,200x of U.S. gross income of the FDE1 tested unit to the extent of that gross income. As a result, the $1,000x disregarded royalty payment causes $1,000x of the $1,200x item of U.S. gross royalty income to be reattributed from the FDE1 tested unit to the FDE2 tested unit, and results in a $1,000x reattribution amount that is also a reattribution payment.
(
3
) The $1,200x Country B gross royalty item that is included in the Country B taxable income of FDE1 is assigned under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the statutory or residual grouping to which the $1,200x corresponding U.S. item is initially assigned under § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(ii), namely, the FDE1 income group. This assignment is made without regard to the $1,000x reattribution payment from the FDE1 tested unit to the FDE2 tested unit; none of the FDE1 tested unit's $1,200x Country B gross royalty income is reattributed to the FDE2 tested unit for this purpose. See paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(
3
) of this section. Under paragraph (f) of this section, all of the $40x of Country B net income tax on the $200x of Country B taxable income is allocated to the FDE1 income group, the statutory grouping to which the $1,200x item of Country B gross royalty income of FDE1 is assigned. No apportionment of the $40x is necessary because the class of gross income to which the foreign gross income is allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping.
(B)
Country C net income tax.
The Country C net income tax is imposed on foreign taxable income of FDE2 that consists of a $1,000x item of Country C gross royalty income. For Federal income tax purposes, under paragraph
(d)(3)(v)(B)(
2
) of this section and § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(ii)(B), the FDE2 tested unit has a reattribution amount of $1,000x of U.S. gross royalty income by reason of its receipt of the $1,000x reattribution payment from FDE1. The $1,000x item of U.S. gross royalty income that is included in the taxable income of the FDE2 tested unit by reason of the $1,000x reattribution payment is assigned under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section to the statutory or residual grouping to which the $1,000x reattribution amount of U.S. gross royalty income that constitutes the reattribution payment is assigned upon receipt by the FDE2 tested unit under § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(ii), namely, the FDE2 income group. Under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section, the $1,000x item of Country C gross royalty income is assigned to the statutory grouping to which the $1,000x corresponding U.S. item is assigned. Accordingly, under paragraph (f) of this section, all of the $150x of Country C net income tax is allocated to the FDE2 income group, the statutory grouping to which the $1,000x item of Country C gross royalty income of FDE2 is assigned. No apportionment of the $150x is necessary because the class of gross income to which the foreign gross income is allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping.

Example 13: Assets of a taxable unit that owns an interest in a lower-tier taxable unit
—(i)
Facts.
USP wholly owns CFC1, a tested unit within the meaning of § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(iv)(A) (the “CFC1 tested unit”). CFC1 wholly owns FDE1, a disregarded entity that is organized in Country A, and FDE2, a disregarded entity that is organized in Country B. CFC1's interests in FDE1 and FDE2 are each tested units within the meaning of § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(iv)(A) (the “FDE1 tested unit” and “FDE2 tested unit,” respectively). The FDE1 tested unit and FDE2 tested unit each own 50% of the interests in FDE3, a disregarded entity that is organized in Country C. CFC1's indirect interests in FDE3 are also a tested unit within the meaning of § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(iv)(A) (the “FDE3 tested unit”). The FDE2 tested unit owns Asset A with a tax book value of $10,000x, and makes a reattribution payment to FDE3 that causes $5,000x of the tax book value of Asset A to be assigned to FDE3 under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(

)(
ii
) of this section. FDE3 owns Asset B, which has a tax book value of $5,000x.

Analysis
—(A)
Assets of the FDE3 tested unit.
The assets of the FDE3 tested unit consist of the portion of Asset A that is assigned to it under paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section and any other assets determined in accordance with § 1.987-6(b). The assets of the FDE3 tested unit thus consist of $5,000x of the tax book value of Asset A and all $5,000x of the tax book value of Asset B.
(B)
Assets of the FDE2 tested unit.
The assets of the FDE2 tested unit consist of the tax book value of any assets that it owns directly plus its pro rata share of the assets of the FDE3 tested unit, including the portion of reattribution assets assigned to the FDE3 tested unit. Asset A is a reattribution asset under paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
ii
) and (d)(3)(v)(E) of this section. The assets of the FDE2 tested unit therefore consist of the portion of Asset A that it owns directly and that was not assigned to the FDE3 tested unit (or $5,000x) plus its pro rata share of the portion of Asset A that was assigned to the FDE3 tested unit, or $2,500x (50% of $5,000x). In addition, the assets of the FDE2 tested unit include its pro rata share of the tax book value of Asset B, or $2,500x (50% of $5,000x).
(C)
Assets of the FDE1 tested unit.
The assets of the FDE1 tested unit consist of its pro rata share of the assets of the FDE3 tested unit, including the portion of reattribution assets assigned to the FDE3 tested unit. Asset A is a reattribution asset under paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(C)(
1
)(
ii
) and (d)(3)(v)(E) of this section. The assets of the FDE1 tested unit therefore consist of its pro rata share of the portion of Asset A that was reattributed to the FDE3 tested unit, or $2,500x (50% of $5,000x), plus its pro rata share of the tax book value of Asset B, or $2,500x (50% of $5,000x).
(h)
Allocation and apportionment of certain foreign in lieu of taxes described in section 903.
A tax that is a foreign income tax by reason of § 1.903-1(c)(1) is allocated and apportioned to statutory and residual groupings in the same proportions as the foreign taxable income
that comprises the excluded income (as defined in § 1.903-1(c)(1)). See paragraph (f) of this section for rules on allocating and apportioning certain withholding taxes described in § 1.903-1(c)(2).

§ 1.863-1
Allocation of gross income under section 863(a).
(a)
In general.
Items of gross income other than those specified in section 861(a) and section 862(a) will generally be separately allocated to sources within or without the United States. See § 1.863-2 for alternate methods to determine the income from sources within or without the United States in the case of items specified in § 1.863-2(a). See also section 865(b) for rules for sourcing income from the sale of inventory property, within the meaning of section 865(i)(1) (inventory), generally, and section 865(e)(2) and § 1.865-3 for sourcing income from the sale of personal property (including inventory) by a nonresident that is attributable to the nonresident's office or other fixed place of business in the United States. In the case of sales of property involving partners and partnerships, the rules of § 1.863-3(f) apply.
(b)
Natural resources
—(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, except to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section or § 1.865-3, gross receipts from the sale outside the United States of products derived from the ownership or operation of any farm, mine, oil or gas well, other natural deposit, or uncut timber within the United States shall be treated as from sources within the United States, and gross receipts from the sale within the United States of products derived from the ownership or operation of any farm, mine, oil or gas well, other natural deposit, or uncut timber outside the United States shall be
treated as from sources without the United States.
(2)
Additional production activities.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, gross receipts from the sale of products derived by a taxpayer who performs additional production activities as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section are allocated between sources within and without the United States based on the fair market value of the product immediately prior to the additional production activities. The source of gross receipts equal to the fair market value of the product immediately prior to the additional production activities will be from sources where the farm, mine, oil or gas well, other natural deposit, or uncut timber is located. The source of gross receipts from the sale of the product in excess of the fair market value immediately prior to the additional production activities must be determined under § 1.863-3. For purposes of applying § 1.863-3, only production assets used in the additional production activities are taken into account.
(3)
Definitions
—(i)
Production activity.
For purposes of this section, production activity means an activity that creates, fabricates, manufactures, extracts, processes, cures, or ages inventory. See § 1.864-1. Except as otherwise provided in § 1.1502-13 or 1.863-3(f)(2), only production activities conducted directly by the taxpayer are taken into account.
(ii)
Additional production activities.
For purposes of this section, additional production activities are substantial production activities performed directly by the taxpayer in addition to activities from the ownership or operation of any farm, mine, oil or gas well, other natural deposit, or uncut timber. Whether a taxpayer's activities constitute additional production activities will be determined under the principles of § 1.954-3(a)(4) (except for § 1.954-3(a)(4)(iv)). However, in no case will activities that prepare the natural resource itself for export, including those that are designed to facilitate the transportation of the natural resource, be considered additional production activities for purposes of this section.
(4)
Determination of fair market value.
For purposes of this section, fair market value depends on all of the facts and circumstances as they exist relative to a party in any particular case. Where the products are sold to a related party in a transaction subject to section 482, the determination of fair market value under this section must be consistent with the arm's length price determined under section 482.
(5)
Determination of gross income.
To determine the amount of a taxpayer's gross income from sources within or without the United States, the taxpayer's gross receipts from sources within or without the United States determined under this paragraph (b) must be reduced by the cost of goods sold properly attributable to gross receipts from sources within or without the United States.
(6)
Tax return disclosure.
A taxpayer that determines the source of its income under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall attach a statement to its return explaining the methodology used to determine fair market value under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and explaining any additional production activities (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section) performed by the taxpayer. In addition, the taxpayer must provide such other information as is required by § 1.863-3.
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b):
(i)
Example 1. No additional production, foreign source gross receipts.
U.S. Mines, a domestic corporation, operates a copper mine and mill in Country X. U.S. Mines extracts copper-bearing rocks from the ground and transports the rocks to the mill where the rocks are ground and processed to produce copper-bearing concentrate. The concentrate is transported to a port where it is dried in preparation for export, stored, and then shipped to purchasers in the United States. Because, under the facts and circumstances, none of U.S. Mines' activities constitute additional production activities, within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, paragraph (b)(2) of this section does not apply, and under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, gross receipts from the sale of the concentrate will be
treated as from sources without the United States.
(ii)
Example 2. No additional production, U.S. source gross receipts.
U.S. Gas, a domestic corporation, extracts natural gas within the United States, and transports the natural gas to a Country X port where it is liquefied in preparation for shipment. The liquefied natural gas is then transported via freighter and sold without additional production activities in a foreign country. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, liquefaction of natural gas is not an additional production activity because liquefaction prepares the natural gas for transportation. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, gross receipts from the sale of the liquefied natural gas will be treated as from sources within the United States.
(iii)
Example 3. Production in United States, foreign sales.
U.S. Gold, a domestic corporation, mines gold in Country X, produces gold jewelry using production assets located in the United States, and sells the jewelry in Country Y. Assume that the fair market value of the gold before the additional production activities in the United States is $40x and that U.S. Gold ultimately sells the gold jewelry in Country Y for $100x. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, $40x of U.S. Gold's gross receipts will be treated as from sources without the United States, and the remaining $60x of gross receipts will be treated as from sources within the United States under § 1.863-3.
(iv)
Example 4. Production and sales in United States.
U.S. Oil, a domestic corporation, extracts oil in Country X, transports the oil via a pipeline to the United States, refines the oil using production assets located in the United States, and sells the refined product in the United States to unrelated persons. Assume that the fair market value of the oil before refinement in the United States is $80x and U.S. Oil ultimately sells the refined product for $100x. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, $80x of gross receipts will be treated as from sources without the United States, and the remaining $20x of gross receipts will be treated as from sources within the United States under § 1.863-3.
(v)
Example 5. Additional production.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that U.S. Mines also operates a smelter in Country X. The concentrate output from the mill is transported to the smelter where it is transformed into smelted copper. The smelted copper is exported to purchasers in the United States. Under the facts and circumstances, all the processes applied to make copper concentrate are considered mining. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, gross receipts equal to the fair market value of the concentrate at the smelter will be treated as from sources without the United States. Under the facts and circumstances, the conversion of the concentrate into smelted copper is an additional production activity in a foreign country within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Therefore, the source of U.S. Mines's excess gross receipts will be determined under § 1.863-3, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(c)
Determination of taxable income.
The taxpayer's taxable income from sources within or without the United States will be determined under the rules of §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T for determining taxable income from sources within the United States.
(d)
Scholarships, fellowship grants, grants, prizes and awards
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (d) applies to scholarships, fellowship grants, grants, prizes and awards. The provisions of this paragraph (d) do not apply to amounts paid as salary or other compensation for services.
(2)
Source of income.
The source of income from scholarships, fellowship grants, grants, prizes and awards is determined as follows:
(i)
United States source income.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, scholarships, fellowship grants, grants, prizes and awards made by a U.S. citizen or resident, a domestic partnership, a domestic corporation, an estate or trust (other than a foreign estate or trust within the meaning of section 7701(a)(31)), the United States (or an instrumentality
or agency thereof), a State (or any political subdivision thereof), or the District of Columbia shall be treated as income from sources within the United States.
(ii)
Foreign source income.
Scholarships, fellowship grants, grants, prizes and awards made by a foreign government (or an instrumentality, agency, or any political subdivision thereof), an international organization (as defined in section 7701(a)(18)), or a person other than a U.S. person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)) shall be treated as income from sources without the United States.
(iii)
Certain activities conducted outside the United States.
Scholarships, fellowship grants, targeted grants, and achievement awards received by a person other than a U.S. person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)) with respect to activities previously conducted (in the case of achievement awards) or to be conducted (in the case of scholarships, fellowships grants, and targeted grants) outside the United States shall be treated as income from sources without the United States.
(3)

§ 1.863-2
Allocation and apportionment of taxable income.
(a)
Determination of taxable income.
Section 863(b) provides an alternate method for determining taxable income from sources within the United States in the case of gross income derived from sources partly within and partly without the United States. Under this method, taxable income is determined by deducting from such gross income the expenses, losses, or other deductions properly apportioned or allocated thereto and a ratable part of any other expenses, losses, or deductions that cannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of gross income. The income to which this section applies will consist of gains, profits, and income:
(1) From certain transportation or other services rendered partly within and partly without the United States to the extent not within the scope of section 863(c) or other specific provisions of this title;
(2) From the sale of inventory property (within the meaning of section 865(i)) produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer in the United States and sold outside the United States or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer outside the United States and sold in the United States; or
(3) Derived from the purchase of personal property within a possession of the United States and its sale within the United States, to the extent not excluded from the scope of these regulations under § 1.936-6(a)(5), Q
A 7.
(b)
Determination of source of taxable income.
Income treated as derived from sources partly within and partly without the United States under paragraph (a) of this section may be allocated or apportioned to sources within and without the United States pursuant to §§ 1.863-1, 1.863-3, 1.863-4, 1.863-8, and 1.863-9. To determine the source of certain types of income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, see § 1.863-4. To determine the source of gross income described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, see § 1.863-1 for natural resources, § 1.863-3 for other sales of inventory property, and § 1.863-8 for source of gross income from space and ocean activity. Section 1.865-3 may apply instead of the provisions in this section to source gross income from sales of personal property (including inventory property) by nonresidents attributable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States. To determine the source of income partly from sources within a possession of the United States, including income described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, see § 1.863-3(e).
(c)
Applicability date.
Except as provided in this paragraph (c), this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 30, 1996. Paragraph (b) of this section applies to taxable years ending on or after December 23, 2019. However, a taxpayer may apply paragraph (b) of this section in its entirety for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending before December 23,
2019, provided that the taxpayer and all persons related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) apply paragraph (b) of this section and §§ 1.863-1(b), 1.863-3, 1.863-8(b)(3)(ii), 1.864-5(a) and (b), 1.864-6(c)(2), and 1.865-3 in their entirety for the taxable year, and once applied, the taxpayer and all persons related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) continue to apply these regulations in their entirety for all subsequent taxable years. For regulations generally applicable to taxable years ending before December 23, 2019, see § 1.863-2 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2020.

§ 1.863-3
Allocation and apportionment of income from certain sales of inventory.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Scope.
Subject to the rules of § 1.865-3, paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section apply to determine the source of income derived from the sale of inventory property (inventory) that a taxpayer produces (in whole or in part) within the United States and sells without the United States, or that a taxpayer produces (in whole or in part) without the United States and sells within the United States (collectively, Section 863(b)(2) Sales). See section 865(i)(1) for the definition of inventory. Paragraph (b) of this section provides that the source of gross income from Section 863(b)(2) Sales is based solely on the production activities with respect to the inventory. Paragraph (c) of this section describes how to determine source based on production activity, including when inventory is produced partly within the United States and partly without the United States. Paragraph (d) of this section determines taxable income from Section 863(b)(2) Sales. Paragraph (e) of this section applies to determine the source of certain income derived from a possession of the United States. Paragraph (f) of this section provides special rules for partnerships for all sales subject to §§ 1.863-1 through 1.863-3. Paragraph (g) of this section provides applicability dates for the rules in this section.
(2)
Cross references.
To determine the source of income derived from the sale of personal property (including inventory) by a nonresident that is attributable to the nonresident's office or other fixed place of business in the United States under section 865(e)(2) and § 1.865-3(c), the rules of § 1.865-3 apply, and the rules of this section do not apply except to the extent provided in § 1.865-3. To determine the source of income from sales of property produced by the taxpayer, when the property is either produced in whole or in part in space, as defined in § 1.863-8(d)(1)(i), or international water, as defined in § 1.863-8(d)(1)(ii), or is sold in space or international water, the rules of § 1.863-8 apply, and the rules of this section do not apply except to the extent provided in § 1.863-8.
(b)
Sourcing based solely on production activities.
Subject to the rules of § 1.865-3, all income, gain, or loss derived from Section 863(b)(2) Sales is allocated and apportioned solely on the basis of the production activities with respect to the inventory.
(c)
Determination of the source of gross income from production activity
—(1)
Production only within the United States or only within foreign countries
—(i)
Source of income.
For purposes of this section, production activity means an activity that creates, fabricates, manufactures, extracts, processes, cures, or ages inventory. See § 1.864-1. Whether a taxpayer's activities constitute production activity is determined under the principles of § 1.954-3(a)(4) (except for § 1.954-3(a)(4)(iv)). Subject to the provisions in § 1.1502-13 or paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the only production activities that are taken into account for purposes of §§ 1.863-1, 1.863-2, and this section are those conducted directly by the taxpayer. Where the taxpayer's production assets are located only within the United States or only outside the United States, gross income is sourced where the taxpayer's production assets are located. For rules regarding the source of income when production assets are located both within the United States and without the United States, see paragraph (c)(2) of this section. For rules regarding the source of income when production takes place, in whole or in part, in
space or international water, the rules of § 1.863-8 apply, and the rules of this section do not apply except to the extent provided in § 1.863-8.
(ii)
Definition of production assets.
Subject to the provisions of § 1.1502-13 and paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, production assets include only tangible and intangible assets owned directly by the taxpayer that are directly used by the taxpayer to produce inventory described in paragraph (a) of this section. Production assets do not include assets that are not directly used to produce inventory described in paragraph (a) of this section. Thus, production assets do not include such assets as accounts receivables, intangibles not related to production of inventory (
e.g.,
marketing intangibles, including trademarks and customer lists), transportation assets, warehouses, the inventory itself, raw materials, or work-in-process. In addition, production assets do not include cash or other liquid assets (including working capital), investment assets, prepaid expenses, or stock of a subsidiary.
(iii)
Location of production assets.
For purposes of this section, a tangible production asset will be considered located where the asset is physically located. An intangible production asset will be considered located where the tangible production assets owned by the taxpayer to which it relates are located.
(2)
Production both within and without the United States
—(i)
Source of income.
Where the taxpayer's production assets are located both within and without the United States, income from sources without the United States will be determined by multiplying the gross income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the average adjusted basis of production assets that are located outside the United States and the denominator of which is the average adjusted basis of all production assets within and without the United States. The remaining income is treated as from sources within the United States.
(ii)
Adjusted basis of production assets
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the adjusted basis of an asset is determined by using the alternative depreciation system under section 168(g)(2). The adjusted basis of all production assets for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is determined as though the production assets were subject to the alternative depreciation system set forth in section 168(g)(2) for the entire period that such property has been in service. The adjusted basis of the production assets is determined without regard to the election to expense certain depreciable assets under section 179 and without regard to any additional first-year depreciation provision (for example, section 168(k), (l), and (m), and former sections 1400L(b) and 1400N(d)). The average adjusted basis of assets is computed by averaging the adjusted basis at the beginning and end of the taxable year, unless by reason of changes during the taxable year, as might be the case in the event of a major acquisition or disposition of assets, the average would materially distort the calculation in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. In this event, the average adjusted basis is determined upon a more appropriate basis that is weighted to reasonably reflect the period for which the assets are held by the taxpayer during the taxable year.
(B)
Production assets used to produce other property.
If a production asset is used to produce inventory sold in Section 863(b)(2) Sales and also used to produce other property during the taxable year, the portion of its adjusted basis that is included in the fraction described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section will be determined under any method that reasonably reflects the portion of the asset that produces inventory sold in Section 863(b)(2) Sales. For example, the portion of such an asset that is included in the formula may be determined by multiplying the asset's average adjusted basis by a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross receipts from sales of inventory from Section 863(b)(2) Sales produced by the asset, and the denominator of which is the gross receipts from all property produced by that asset.
(3)
Anti-abuse rule.
The purpose of paragraph (b) of this section and this paragraph (c) is to attribute the source of the taxpayer's gross income from certain sales of inventory property to
the location of the taxpayer's production activity. Therefore, if the taxpayer has entered into or structured one or more transactions with a principal purpose of reducing its U.S. tax liability in a manner inconsistent with the purpose of paragraph (b) of this section or this paragraph (c), the Commissioner may make appropriate adjustments so that the source of the taxpayer's gross income more clearly reflects the location of production activity. For example, a taxpayer may be subject to the rule in this paragraph (c)(3) if domestic production assets are acquired by a related partnership (or a subsidiary of a related partnership) with a principal purpose of reducing its U.S. tax liability by claiming that the taxpayer's income from sales of inventory is subject to section 862(a)(6) rather than section 863(b).
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c):
(i)
Example 1. Source of gross income
—(A)
Facts.
A, a U.S. corporation, produces widgets that are sold both within the United States and within a foreign country. The initial manufacture of all widgets occurs in the United States. The second stage of production of widgets that are sold within a foreign country is completed within the country of sale. A's U.S. plant and machinery which is involved in the initial manufacture of the widgets has an average adjusted basis of $200, as determined using the alternative depreciation system under section 168(g)(2). A also owns warehouses used to store work-in-process. A owns foreign equipment with an average adjusted basis of $25. A's gross receipts from all sales of widgets is $100, and its gross receipts from export sales of widgets is $25. Assume that apportioning average adjusted basis using gross receipts is reasonable. Assume A's cost of goods sold from the sale of widgets in the foreign countries is $13 and thus, its gross income from widgets sold in foreign countries is $12.
(B)
Analysis.
A determines its gross income from sources without the United States by multiplying A's $12 of gross income from sales of widgets in foreign countries by a fraction, the numerator of which is all relevant foreign production assets, or $25, and the denominator of which is all relevant production assets, or $75 ($25 foreign assets + ($200 U.S. assets × $25 gross receipts from export sales/$100 gross receipts from all sales)). Therefore, A's gross income from sources without the United States is $4 ($12 × ($25/$75)).
(ii)
Example 2. Location of intangible property.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that A employs a patented process that applies only to the initial production of widgets. In computing the formula used to determine the source of gross income, A's patent, if it has an average adjusted basis, would be located in the United States.
(iii)
Example 3. Anti-abuse rule
—(A)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
). A sells its U.S. assets to B, an unrelated U.S. corporation, with a principal purpose of reducing its U.S. tax liability by manipulating the property fraction. A then leases these assets from B. After this transaction, under the general rule of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, all of A's gross income would be considered from sources without the United States, because all of A's relevant production assets are located within a foreign country. Since the leased property is not owned by the taxpayer, it is not included in the fraction.
(B)
Analysis.
Because A has entered into a transaction with a principal purpose of reducing its U.S. tax liability by manipulating the formula described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, A's income must be adjusted to more clearly reflect the source of that income. In this case, the Commissioner may redetermine the source of A's gross income by ignoring the sale-leaseback transactions.
(d)
Determination of source of taxable income.
Once the source of gross income has been determined under paragraph (c) of this section, the taxpayer must properly allocate and apportion its expenses, losses, and other deductions to its respective amounts of gross income from sources within and without the United States from its Section 863(b)(2) Sales. See §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and 1.861-17.
(e)
Income partly from sources within a possession of the United States
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (e) relates to certain sales that give rise to income, gain, or loss that is treated as derived partly from sources within the United States and partly from sources within a possession of the United States (Section 863 Possession Sales). This paragraph (e) applies to determine the source of income derived from the sale of inventory produced (in whole or in part) by a taxpayer within the United States and sold within a possession of the United States, or produced (in whole or in part) by a taxpayer in a possession of the United States and sold within the United States (collectively, Possession Production Sales). It also applies to determine the source of income derived from the purchase of personal property within a possession of the United States and its sale within the United States (Possession Purchase Sales). A taxpayer subject to this paragraph (e) must apportion gross income from Section 863 Possession Sales under paragraph (e)(2) of this section (in the case of Possession Production Sales) or under paragraph (e)(3) of this section (in the case of Possession Purchase Sales). The source of taxable income from Section 863 Possession Sales is determined under paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Allocation or apportionment for Possession Production Sales.
The source of gross income from Possession Production Sales is determined under the rules of paragraph (c) of this section, except that the term
possession of the United States
is substituted for
foreign country
wherever it appears.
(3)
Allocation or apportionment for Possession Purchase Sales
—(i)
Determination of source of gross income from Possession Purchase Sales.
Gross income from Possession Purchase Sales is allocated in its entirety to the taxpayer's business activity, and is then apportioned between sources within the United States and sources within a possession of the United States under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Determination of source of gross income from business activity
—(A)
Source of gross income.
Gross income from the taxpayer's business activity is sourced in the possession in the same proportion that the amount of the taxpayer's business activity for the taxable year within the possession bears to the amount of the taxpayer's business activity for the taxable year both within the possession and outside the possession, with respect to Possession Purchase Sales. The remaining income is sourced in the United States.
(B)
Business activity.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), the taxpayer's business activity is equal to the sum of—
(
1
) The amounts for the taxable period paid for wages, salaries, and other compensation of employees, and other expenses attributable to Possession Purchase Sales (other than amounts that are nondeductible under section 263A, interest, and research and development);
(
2
) Cost of goods sold attributable to Possession Purchase Sales during the taxable period; and
(
3
) Possession Purchase Sales for the taxable period.
(C)
Location of business activity.
For purposes of determining the location of the taxpayer's business activity within a possession, the following rules apply:
(
1
)
Sales activity.
Receipts from gross sales will be attributed to a possession in accordance with the principles of § 1.861-7(c).
(
2
)
Cost of goods sold.
Payments for cost of goods sold will be properly attributable to gross receipts from sources within the possession only to the extent that the property purchased was manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the possession (within the meaning of section 954(d)(1)(A)).
(
3
)
Expenses.
Expenses will be attributed to a possession under the rules of §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T.
(
4
)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section relating to the determination of source of gross income from business activity:
(i)
Example 1. Purchase of goods manufactured in possession
—(A)
Facts.
U.S. Co. purchases in a possession product X for $80 from A. A manufactures X in the possession. Without further production, U.S. Co. sells X in the United States for $100. Assume U.S. Co. has sales and administrative expenses in the possession of $10.
(B)
Analysis.
To determine the source of U.S. Co.'s gross income, the $100 gross income from sales of X is allocated entirely to U.S. Co.'s business activity. Forty-seven dollars of U.S. Co.'s gross income is sourced in the possession. [Possession expenses ($10) plus possession purchases (
i.e.,
cost of goods sold) ($80) plus possessions sales ($0), divided by total expenses ($10) plus total purchases ($80) plus total sales ($100).] The remaining $53 is sourced in the United States.
(ii)
Example 2. Purchase of goods manufactured outside possession
—(A)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that A manufactures X outside the possession.
(B)
Analysis.
To determine the source of U.S. Co.'s gross income, the $100 gross income is allocated entirely to U.S. Co.'s business activity. Five dollars of U.S. Co.'s gross income is sourced in the possession. [Possession expenses ($10) plus possession purchases ($0) plus possession sales ($0), divided by total expenses ($10) plus total purchases ($80) plus total sales ($100).] The $80 purchase is not included in the numerator used to determine U.S. Co.'s business activity in the possession, since product X was not manufactured in the possession. The remaining $95 is sourced in the United States.
(5)
Special rules for partnerships.
In applying the rules of this paragraph (e) to transactions involving partners and partnerships, the rules of paragraph (f) of this section apply.
(f)
Special rules for partnerships
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of § 1.863-1 and this section, a taxpayer's production activity does not include production activities conducted by a partnership of which the taxpayer is a partner either directly or through one or more partnerships, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(3) or (f)(2) of this section.
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining the source of the partner's distributive share of partnership income or determining the source of the partner's income from the sale of inventory property which the partnership distributes to the partner in kind, the partner's production activity includes an activity conducted by the partnership. In addition, the production activity of a partnership includes the production activity of a taxpayer that is a partner either directly or through one or more partnerships, to the extent that the partner's production activity is related to inventory that the partner contributes to the partnership in a transaction described under section 721.
(ii)
Attribution of production assets to or from a partnership.
A partner will be treated as owning its proportionate share of the partnership's production assets only to the extent that, under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the partner's activity includes production activity conducted through a partnership. A partner's share of partnership assets will be determined by reference to the partner's distributive share of partnership income for the year attributable to such production assets. Similarly, to the extent a partnership's activities include the production activities of a partner, the partnership will be treated as owning the partner's production assets related to the inventory that is contributed in kind to the partnership. See paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for rules apportioning the basis of assets to Section 863 Sales.
(iii)
Basis.
For purposes of this section, in those cases where the partner is treated as owning its proportionate share of the partnership's production assets, the partner's basis in production assets held through a partnership shall be determined by reference to the partnership's adjusted basis in its assets (including a partner's special basis adjustment, if any, under section 743). Similarly, a partnership's basis in a partner's production assets is determined with reference to the partner's adjusted basis in its assets.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (f):
(i)
Example 1. Distributive share of partnership income.
A, a U.S. corporation, forms a partnership in the United States with B, a country X corporation. A and B each have a 50 percent interest in the income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of the partnership.
The partnership is engaged in the manufacture and sale of widgets. The widgets are manufactured in the partnership's plant located in the United States and are sold by the partnership outside the United States. The partnership owns the manufacturing facility and all other production assets used to produce the widgets. A's distributive share of partnership income includes 50 percent of the sales income from these sales. In applying the rules of section 863 to determine the source of its distributive share of partnership income from the export sales of widgets, A is treated as carrying on the activity of the partnership related to production of these widgets and as owning a proportionate share of the partnership's assets related to production of the widgets, based upon its distributive share of partnership income.
(ii)
Example 2. Distribution in kind.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
) except that the partnership, instead of selling the widgets, distributes the widgets to A and B. A then further processes the widgets and then sells them outside the United States. In determining the source of the income earned by A on the sales outside the United States, A is treated as conducting the activities of the partnership related to production of the distributed widgets. Thus, the source of gross income on the sale of the widgets is determined under section 863 and this section. In applying paragraph (c) of this section, A is treated as owning its proportionate share of the partnership's production assets based upon its distributive share of partnership income.
(g)
Applicability dates.
This section applies to taxable years ending on or after December 23, 2019. However, a taxpayer may apply this section in its entirety for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending before December 23, 2019, provided that the taxpayer and all persons related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) apply this section and §§ 1.863-1(b), 1.863-2(b), 1.863-8(b)(3)(ii), 1.864-5(a) and (b), 1.864-6(c)(2), and 1.865-3 in their entirety for the taxable year, and once applied, the taxpayer and all persons related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) continue to apply these regulations in their entirety for all subsequent taxable years. For regulations generally applicable to taxable years ending before December 23, 2019, see § 1.863-3 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2020.

§ 1.863-3A
Income from the sale of personal property derived partly from within and partly from without the United States.
(a)
General
—(1)
Classes of income.
Income from the sale of property to which paragraph (b)(2) and (3) of § 1.863-2 applies is divided into two classes for purposes of this section, namely, income which is treated as derived partly from sources within the United States and partly from sources within a foreign country, and income which is treated as derived partly from sources within the United States and partly from sources within a possession of the United States.
(2)
Definition.
For purposes of this section, the word “produced” includes created, fabricated, manufactured, extracted, processed, cured, or aged. For determining the time and place of sale of personal property for purposes of this section, see paragraph (c) of § 1.861-7.
(b)
Income partly from sources within a foreign country
—(1)
General.
This paragraph relates to gains, profits, and income derived from the sale of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within the United States and sold within a foreign country, or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within a foreign country and sold within the United States. Pursuant to section 863(b) such items shall be treated as derived partly from sources within the United States and partly from sources within a foreign country.
(2)
Allocation or apportionment.
The taxable income from sources within the United States, in the case of the items to which this paragraph applies, shall be determined according to the examples set forth in this subparagraph. For
such purposes, the deductions for the personal exemptions shall not be taken into account, but the special deductions described in paragraph (c) of § 1.861-8 shall be taken into account.

# Example 1.
Where the manufacturer or producer regularly sells part of his output to wholly independent distributors or other selling concerns in such a way as to establish fairly an independent factory or production price—or shows to the satisfaction of the district director (or, if applicable, the Director of International Operations) that such an independent factory or production price has been otherwise established—unaffected by considerations of tax liability and the selling or distributing branch or department of the business is located in a different country from that in which the factory is located or the production carried on, the taxable income attributable to sources within the United States shall be computed by an accounting which treats the products as sold by the factory or productive department of the business to the distributing or selling department at the independent factory price so established. In all such cases the basis of the accounting shall be fully explained in a statement attached to the return for the taxable year.

# Example 2.
(i)-(ii) [Reserved]. For guidance, see § 863-3T(b)(2)
Example
(2)(i) and (ii).
(iii) The term “gross sales”, as used in this example, refers only to the sales of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within the United States and sold within a foreign country or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within a foreign country and sold within the United States.
(iv) The term “property”, as used in this example, includes only the property held or used to produce income which is derived from such sales. Such property should be taken at its actual value, which in the case of property valued or appraised for purposes of inventory, depreciation, depletion, or other purposes of taxation shall be the highest amount at which so valued or appraised, and which in other cases shall be deemed to be its book value in the absence of affirmative evidence showing such value to be greater or less than the actual value. The average value during the taxable year or period shall be employed. The average value of property as above prescribed at the beginning and end of the taxable year or period ordinarily may be used, unless by reason of material changes during the taxable year or period such average does not fairly represent the average for such year or period, in which event the average shall be determined upon a monthly or daily basis.
(v) Bills and accounts receivable shall (unless satisfactory reason for a different treatment is shown) be assigned or allocated to the United States when the debtor resides in the United States, unless the taxpayer has no office, branch, or agent in the United States.

# Example 3.
Application for permission to base the return upon the taxpayer's books of account will be considered by the district director (or, if applicable, the Director of International Operations) in the case of any taxpayer who, in good faith and unaffected by considerations of tax liability, regularly employs in his books of account a detailed allocation of receipts and expenditures which reflects more clearly than the processes or formulas herein prescribed the taxable income derived from sources within the United States.
(c)
Income partly from sources within a possession of the United States
—(1)
General.
This paragraph relates to gains, profits, and income which, pursuant to section 863(b), are treated as derived partly from sources within the United States and partly from sources within a possession of the United States. The items so treated are described in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph.
(2)
Allocation or apportionment.
The taxable income from sources within the United States, in the case of the items to which this paragraph applies, shall be determined according to the examples set forth in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph. For such purposes, the deductions for the personal exemptions shall not be taken into account, but the special deductions described in paragraph (c) of § 1.861-8 shall be taken into account.
(3)
Personal property produced and sold.
This subparagraph relates to gross income derived from the sale of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within the United States and sold within a possession of the United States, or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within a possession of the United States and sold within the United States.

# Example 1.
Same as example 1 under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) Where an independent factory or production price has not been established as provided under example 1, the taxable income shall first be computed by deducting from the gross income derived from the sale of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within the United States and sold within a possession of
the United States, or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within a possession of the United States and sold within the United States, the expenses, losses, or other deductions properly allocated and apportioned thereto in accordance with the rules set forth in § 1.861-8.
(ii) Of the amount of taxable income so determined, one-half shall be apportioned in accordance with the value of the taxpayer's property within the United States and within the possession of the United States, the portion attributable to sources within the United States being determined by multiplying such one-half by a fraction the numerator of which consists of the value of the taxpayer's property within the United States, and the denominator of which consists of the value of the taxpayer's property both within the United States and within the possession of the United States. The remaining one-half of such taxable income shall be apportioned in accordance with the total business of the taxpayer within the United States and within the possession of the United States, the portion attributable to sources within the United States being determined by multiplying such one-half by a fraction the numerator of which consists of the amount of the taxpayer's business for the taxable year or period within the United States, and the denominator of which consists of the amount of the taxpayer's business for the taxable year or period both within the United States and within the possession of the United States.
(iii) “The business of the taxpayer”, as used in this example, shall be measured by the amounts which the taxpayer paid out during the taxable year or period for wages, salaries, and other compensation of employees and for the purchase of goods, materials, and supplies consumed in the regular course of business, plus the amounts received during the taxable year or period from gross sales, such expenses, purchases, and gross sales being limited to those attributable to the production (in whole or in part) of personal property within the United States and its sale within a possession of the United States or to the production (in whole or in part) of personal property within a possession of the United States and its sale within the United States. The term “property”, as used in this example, includes only the property held or used to produce income which is derived from such sales.

# Example 3.
Same as example 3 under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4)
Personal property purchased and sold.
This subparagraph relates to gross income derived from the purchase of personal property within a possession of the United States and its sale within the United States.

# Example 1.
(i) The taxable income shall first be computed by deducting from such gross income the expenses, losses, or other deductions properly allocated or apportioned thereto in accordance with the rules set forth in § 1.861-8.
(ii) The amount of taxable income so determined shall be apportioned in accordance with the total business of the taxpayer within the United States and within the possession of the United States, the portion attributable to sources within the United States being that percentage of such taxable income which the amount of the taxpayer's business for the taxable year or period within the United States bears to the amount of the taxpayer's business for the taxable year or period both within the United States and within the possession of the United States.
(iii) The “business of the taxpayer”, as that term is used in this example, shall be measured by the amounts which the taxpayer paid out during the taxable year or period for wages, salaries, and other compensation of employees and for the purchase of goods, materials, and supplies sold or consumed in the regular course of business, plus the amount received during the taxable year or period from gross sales, such expenses, purchases, and gross sales being limited to those attributable to the purchase of personal property within a possession of the United States and its sale within the United States.

(i) Where an independent factory or production price has not been established as provided under
Example
(1), the gross income derived from the sale of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within the United States and sold within a foreign country or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within a foreign country and sold within the United States shall be computed.
(ii) Of this gross amount, one-half shall be apportioned in accordance with the value of the taxpayer's property within the United States and within the foreign country, the
portion attributable to sources within the United States being determined by multiplying such one-half by a fraction, the numerator of which consists of the value of the taxpayer's property within the United States and the denominator of which consists of the value of the taxpayer's property both within the United States and within the foreign country. The remaining one-half of such gross income shall be apportioned in accordance with the gross sales of the taxpayer within the United States and within the foreign country, the portion attributable to sources within the United States being determined by multiplying such one-half by a fraction the numerator of which consists of the taxpayer's gross sales for the taxable year or period within the United States, and the denominator of which consists of the taxpayer's gross sales for the taxable year or period both within the United States and within the foreign country. Deductions from gross income that are allocable and apportionable to gross income described in paragraph (i) of this

§ 1.863-4
Certain transportation services.
(a)
General.
A taxpayer carrying on the business of transportation service (other than an activity giving rise to transportation income described in section 863(c) or to income subject to other specific provisions of this title) between points in the United States and points outside the United States derives income partly from sources within and partly from sources without the United States.
(b)
Gross income.
The gross income from sources within the United States derived from such services shall be determined by taking such a portion of the total gross revenues therefrom as (1) the sum of the costs or expenses of such transportation business carried on by the taxpayer within the United States and a reasonable return upon the property used in its transportation business while within the United States bears to (2) the sum of the total costs or expenses of such transportation business carried on by the taxpayer and a reasonable return upon the total property used in such transportation business. Revenues from operations incidental to transportation services, such as the sale of money orders, shall be apportioned on the same basis as direct revenues from transportation services.
(c)
Allocation of costs or expenses.
In allocating the total costs or expenses incurred in such transportation business, costs or expenses incurred in connection with that part of the services which was wholly rendered in the United States shall be assigned to the cost of transportation business within the United States. For example, expenses of loading and unloading in the United States, rentals, office expenses, salaries, and wages wholly incurred for services rendered to the taxpayer in the United States belong to this class. Costs and expenses incurred in connection with services rendered partly within and partly without the United States may be prorated on a reasonable basis between such services. For example, ship wages, charter money, insurance, and supplies chargeable to voyage expenses shall ordinarily be prorated for each voyage on the basis of the proportion which the number of days the ship was within the territorial limits of the United States bears to the total number of days on the voyage; and fuel consumed on each voyage may be prorated on the basis of the proportion which the number of miles sailed within the territorial limits of the United States bears to the total number of miles sailed on the voyage. For other expenses entering into the cost of services, only such expenses as are allowable deductions under the internal revenue laws shall be taken into account.
(d)
Items not included as costs or expenses
—(1)
Taxes and interest.
Income, war profits, and excess profits taxes shall not be regarded as costs or expenses for the purpose of determining the proportion of gross income from sources within the United States; and, for such purpose, interest and other expenses for the use of borrowed capital shall not be taken into the cost of services rendered, for the reason that the
return upon the property used measures the extent to which such borrowed capital is the source of the income. See paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
(2)
Other business activity and general expenses.
If a taxpayer subject to this section is also engaged in a business other than that of providing transportation service between points in the United States and points outside the United States, the costs and expenses, including taxes, properly apportioned or allocated to such other business shall be excluded both from the deductions and from the apportionment process prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section; but, for the purpose of determining taxable income, a ratable part of any general expenses, losses, or deductions, which cannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of gross income, may be deducted from the gross income from sources within the United States after the amount of such gross income has been determined. Such ratable part shall ordinarily be based upon the ratio of gross income from sources within the United States to the total gross income. See paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(3)
Personal exemptions and special deductions.
The deductions for the personal exemptions, and the special deductions described in paragraph (c) of § 1.861-8, shall not be taken into account for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section.
(e)
Property used while within the United States
—(1)
General.
The value of the property used shall be determined upon the basis of cost less depreciation. Eight percent may ordinarily be taken as a reasonable rate of return to apply to such property. The property taken shall be the average property employed in the transportation service between points in the United States and points outside the United States during the taxable year.
(2)
Average property.
For ships, the average shall be determined upon a daily basis for each ship, and the amount to be apportioned for each ship as assets employed within the United States shall be computed upon the proportion which the number of days the ship was within the territorial limits of the United States bears to the total number of days the ship was in service during the taxable period. For other assets employed in the transportation business, the average of the assets at the beginning and end of the taxable period ordinarily may be taken, but if the average so obtained does not, by reason of material changes during the taxable year, fairly represent the average for such year either for the assets employed in the transportation business in the United States or in total, the average must be determined upon a monthly or daily basis.
(3)
Current assets.
Current assets shall be decreased by current liabilities and allocated to services between the United States and foreign countries and to other services. The part allocated to services between the United States and foreign countries shall be based on the proportion which the gross receipts from such services bear to the gross receipts from all services. The amount so allocated to services between the United States and foreign countries shall be further allocated to services rendered within the United States and to services rendered without the United States. The portion allocable to services rendered within the United States shall be based on the proportion which the expenses incurred within the territorial limits of the United States bear to the total expenses incurred in services between the United States and foreign countries.
(f)
Taxable income
—(1)
General.
In computing taxable income from sources within the United States there shall be allowed as deductions from the gross income from such sources, determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, (i) the expenses of the transportation business carried on within the United States (as determined under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section) and (ii) the expenses and deductions determined in accordance with this paragraph.
(2)
Interest and taxes.
Interest and income, war-profits, and excess profits taxes shall be excluded from the apportionment process, as indicated in paragraph (d) of this section; but, for the purpose of computing taxable income there may be deducted from the gross income from sources within the United States, after the amount of such gross income has been determined, a ratable
part of all interest deductible under section 163 and of all income, war-profits, and excess profits taxes deductible under section 164, paid or accrued in respect of the business of transportation service between points in the United States and points outside the United States. The ratable part shall ordinarily be based upon the ratio of gross income from sources within the United States to the total gross income, from such transportation service.
(3)
General expenses.
General expenses, losses, or deductions shall be deducted under this paragraph to the extent indicated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(4)
Personal exemptions.
The deductions for the personal exemptions shall be allowed under this paragraph to the same extent as provided by paragraph (b) of § 1.861-8.
(5)
Special deductions.
The special deductions allowed in the case of a corporation by sections 241, 922, and 941 shall be allowed under this paragraph to the same extent as provided by paragraph (c) of § 1.861-8.
(g)
Allocation based on books of account.
Application for permission to base the return upon the taxpayer's books of account will be considered by the district director (or, if applicable, the Director of International Operations) in the case of any taxpayer subject to this section, who, in good faith and unaffected by considerations of tax liability, regularly employs in his books of account a detailed allocation of receipts and expenditures which more clearly reflects the income derived from sources within the United States than does the process prescribed by paragraphs (b) to (f), inclusive, of this section.

§ 1.863-6
Income from sources within a foreign country.
The principles applied in sections 861 through 863 and section 865 and the regulations thereunder for determining the gross and the taxable income from sources within and without the United States shall generally be applied in determining the gross and the taxable income from sources within and without a particular foreign country when such a determination must be made under any provision of Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, including section 952(a)(5). This section shall not apply, however, to the extent it is determined by applying § 1.863-3 that a portion of the taxable income is from sources within the United States and the balance of the taxable income is from sources within a foreign country. In the application of this section, the name of the particular foreign country shall be used instead of the term
United States
, and the term
domestic
shall be construed to mean created or organized in such foreign country. In applying section 861 and the regulations thereunder for purposes of this section, references to sections 243 and 245 shall be excluded, and the exception in section 861(a)(3) shall not apply. In the case of any item of income, the income from sources within a foreign country shall not exceed the amount which, by applying any provision of sections 861 through 863 and section 865 and the regulations thereunder without reference to this section, is treated as income from sources without the United States. See § 1.937-2T for rules for determining income from sources within a possession of the United States.
[T.D. 9194, 70 FR 18928, Apr. 11, 2005]
§ 1.863-7
Allocation of income attributable to certain notional principal contracts under section 863(a).
(a)
Scope
—(1)
Introduction.
This section provides rules relating to the source and, in certain cases, the character of notional principal contract income. However, this section does not apply to income from a section 988 transaction within the meaning of section 988 and the regulations thereunder, relating to the treatment of certain nonfunctional currency transactions. Further, this section does not apply to a dividend equivalent described in section 871(m) and the regulations thereunder. Notional principal contract income is income attributable to a notional principal contract as defined in § 1.446-3(c). An agreement between a taxpayer and a qualified business unit (as defined in section 989(a)) of the taxpayer, or among qualified business units of the same taxpayer, is
not a notional principal contract, because a taxpayer cannot enter into a contract with itself.
(2)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to notional principal contract income includible in income on or after February 13, 1991. However, any taxpayer desiring to apply paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section to notional principal contract income includible in income prior to February 13, 1991, in lieu of temporary Income Tax Regulations § 1.863-7T(b)(2)(iv) may (on a consistent basis) so choose. See paragraph (c) of this section for an election to apply the rules of this section to notional principal contract income includible in income before December 24, 1986. With respect to a dividend equivalent described in section 871(m) and the regulations thereunder, this section applies to payments made on or after January 23, 2012.
(b)
Source of notional principal contract income
—(1)
General rule.
Unless paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section applies, the source of notional principal contract income shall be determined by reference to the residence of the taxpayer as determined under section 988(a)(3)(B)(i).
(2)
Qualified business unit exception.
The source of notional principal contract income shall be determined by reference to the residence of a qualified business unit of a taxpayer if—
(i) The taxpayer's residence, determined under section 988(a)(3)(B)(i), is the United States;
(ii) The qualified business unit's residence, determined under section 988(a)(3)(B)(ii), is outside the United States;
(iii) The qualified business unit is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business where it is a resident as determined under section 988(a)(3)(B)(ii); and
(iv) The notional principal contract is properly reflected on the books of the qualified business unit. Whether a notional principal contract is properly reflected on the books of such qualified business unit is a question of fact. The degree of participation in the negotiation and acquisition of a notional principal contract shall be considered in this determination. Participation in connection with the negotiation or acquisition of a notional principal contract may be disregarded if the district director determines that a purpose for such participation was to affect the source of notional principal contract income.
(3)
Effectively connected notional principal contract income.
Notional principal contract income that under principles similar to those set forth in § 1.864-4(c) arises from the conduct of a United States trade or business shall be sourced in the United States and such income shall be treated as effectively connected to the conduct of a United States trade or business for purposes of sections 871(b) and 882(a)(1).
(c)
Election
—(1)
Eligibility and effect.
A taxpayer described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section may make an election to apply the rules of this section to all, but not part, of the taxpayer's income attributable to notional principal contracts for all taxable years (or portion thereof) beginning before December 24, 1986, for which the period of limitations for filing a claim for refund under section 6511(a) has not expired. A taxpayer not described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section that is engaged in trade or business within the United States may make an election to apply the rules of this section to all, but not part, of the taxpayer's income described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section for all taxable years (or portion thereof) beginning before December 24, 1986, for which the period of limitations for filing a claim for refund under section 6511(a) has not expired. If a taxpayer makes an election pursuant to this paragraph (c)(1) in the time and manner provided in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section, then, with respect to such taxable years (or portion thereof), no tax shall be deducted or withheld under sections 1441 and 1442 with respect to payments made by the taxpayer pursuant to a notional principal contract the income attributable to which is subject to such election. The election may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(2)
Time for making election.
The election specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be made by May 14, 1991.
(3)
Manner of making election.
The election described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be made by attaching a statement to the tax return or an
amended tax return for each taxable year beginning before December 24, 1986, in which the taxpayer accrued or received notional principal contract income. The statement shall—
(i) Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of the electing taxpayer;
(ii) Identify the election as a “Notional Principal Contract Election under § 1.863-7”; and
(iii) Specify each taxable year described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in which payments were made.
(d)
Example.
The operation of this section is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(1) On January 1, 1990, X, a calendar year domestic corporation, entered into an interest rate swap contract with FZ, an unrelated foreign corporation. X does not have a qualified business unit outside the United States. Under the contract, X is required to pay FZ fixed rate dollar amounts, and FZ is required to pay X floating rate dollar amounts, each determined solely by reference to a notional dollar denominated principal amount specified under the contract. The contract is a notional principal contract under § 1.863-7(a) because the contract provides for the payment of amounts at specified intervals calculated by reference to a specified index upon a notional principal amount in exchange for a promise to pay similar amounts.
(2) Assume that during 1990 X had notional principal contract income of $100 in connection with the notional principal contract described in (1) above. Also assume that the contract provides that payments more than 30 days late give rise to a $5 fee, and that X receives such a fee in 1990. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the source of X's $100 of income attributable to the swap agreement is domestic. The $5 fee is not notional principal contract income.
(e)
Cross references.

§ 1.863-8
Source of income derived from space and ocean activity under section 863(d).
(a)
In general.
Income of a United States or a foreign person derived from space and ocean activity (space and ocean income) is sourced under the rules of this section, notwithstanding any other provision, including sections 861, 862, 863, and 865. A taxpayer will not be considered to derive income from space or ocean activity, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, if such activity is performed by another person, subject to the rules for the treatment of consolidated groups in § 1.1502-13.
(b)
Source of gross income from space and ocean activity
—(1)
Space and ocean income derived by a United States person.
Space and ocean income derived by a United States person is income from sources within the United States. However, space and ocean income derived by a United States person is income from sources without the United States to the extent the income, based on all the facts and circumstances, is attributable to functions performed, resources employed, or risks assumed in a foreign country or countries.
(2)
Space and ocean income derived by a foreign person
—(i)
In general.
Space and ocean income derived by a person other than a United States person is income from sources without the United States, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2).
(ii)
Space and ocean income derived by a controlled foreign corporation.
Space and ocean income derived by a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is income from sources within the United States. However, space and ocean income derived by a CFC is income from sources without the United States to the extent the income, based on all the facts and circumstances, is attributable to functions performed, resources employed, or risks assumed in a foreign country or countries. For purposes of this section, a CFC has the meaning provided in section 957, determined without applying section 318(a)(3)(A), (B), and (C) so as to consider a United States person as owning stock which is owned by a person who is not a United States person.
(iii)
Space and ocean income derived by foreign persons engaged in a trade or business within the United States.
Space and ocean income derived by a foreign person (other than a CFC) engaged in a trade or business within the United States is income from sources within the United States to the extent the income, based on all the facts and circumstances, is attributable to functions performed, resources employed, or risks assumed within the United States.
(3)
Source rules for income from certain sales of property
—(i)
Sales of purchased property.
When a taxpayer sells purchased property in space or international water, the source of gross income from the sale generally will be determined under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable. However, if such property is inventory property within the meaning of section 1221(a)(1) (inventory property) and is sold for use, consumption, or disposition outside space and international water, the source of income from the sale will be determined under § 1.861-7(c).
(ii)
Sales of property produced by the taxpayer
—(A)
General.
If the taxpayer both produces property and sells such property and either the production (in whole or in part) or the sale takes place in space or international water, the taxpayer must allocate and apportion all income, gain, or loss derived from sales of such property solely on the basis of the production activities with respect to such property, and the source of that income will be determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section. To determine the source of income derived from the sale of personal property (including inventory) by a nonresident that is attributable to the nonresident's office or other fixed place of business in the United States under section 865(e)(2), the rules of § 1.865-3 apply, and the rules of this section do not apply.
(B)
Production only in space or international water, or only outside space and international water.
When production occurs only in space or international water, gross income is sourced under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable. When production occurs only outside space and international water, gross income is sourced under § 1.863-3(c).
(C)
Production both in space or international water and outside space and international water.
When property is produced both in space or international water and outside space and international water, gross income must be allocated to production occurring in space or international water and production occurring outside space and international water. Such gross income is allocated to production activity occurring in space or international water to the extent the income, based on all the facts and circumstances, is attributable to functions performed, resources employed, or risks assumed in space or international water. The balance of such gross income is allocated to production activity occurring outside space and international water. The source of gross income in space or international water is determined under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable. The source of gross income occurring outside space and international water is determined under § 1.863-3(c).
(4)
Special rule for determining the source of gross income from services.
To the extent a transaction characterized as the performance of a service constitutes a space or ocean activity, as determined under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the source of gross income derived from such transaction is determined under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(5)
Special rule for determining source of income from communications activity (other than income from international communications activity).
Space and ocean activity, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, includes activity that occurs in space or international water that is characterized as a communications activity as defined in § 1.863-9(h)(1) (other than international communications activity). The source of space and ocean income that is also communications income as defined in § 1.863-9(h)(2) (but not space/ocean communications income as defined in § 1.863-9(h)(3)(v)) is determined under the rules of § 1.863-9(c), (d), and (f), as applicable, rather than under paragraph (b) of this section. The source of space and ocean income that is also
space/ocean communications income as defined in § 1.863-9(h)(3)(v) is determined under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. See § 1.863-9(e).
(c)
Taxable income.
When a taxpayer allocates gross income under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(ii), or (b)(4) of this section, the taxpayer must allocate expenses, losses, and other deductions as prescribed in §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T to the class or classes of gross income that include the income so allocated in each case. A taxpayer must then apply the rules of §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T to apportion properly amounts of expenses, losses, and other deductions so allocated to such gross income between gross income from sources within the United States and gross income from sources without the United States.
(d)
Space and ocean activity
—(1)
Definition
—(i)
Space activity.
In general, space activity is any activity conducted in space. For purposes of this section, space means any area not within the jurisdiction (as recognized by the United States) of a foreign country, possession of the United States, or the United States, and not in international water. For purposes of determining space activity, the Commissioner may separate parts of a single transaction into separate transactions or combine separate transactions as part of a single transaction. Paragraph (d)(3) of this section lists specific exceptions to the general definition of space activity. Activities that constitute space activity include but are not limited to—
(A) Performance and provision of services in space, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section;
(B) Leasing of equipment located in space, including spacecraft (for example, satellites) or transponders located in space;
(C) Licensing of technology or other intangibles for use in space;
(D) Production, processing, or creation of property in space, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section;
(E) Activity occurring in space that is characterized as communications activity (other than international communications activity) under § 1.863-9(h)(1);
(F) Underwriting income from the insurance of risks on activities that produce space income; and
(G) Sales of property in space (see § 1.861-7(c)).
(ii)
Ocean activity.
In general, ocean activity is any activity conducted on or under water not within the jurisdiction (as recognized by the United States) of a foreign country, possession of the United States, or the United States (collectively, in international water). For purposes of determining ocean activity, the Commissioner may separate parts of a single transaction into separate transactions or combine separate transactions as part of a single transaction. Paragraph (d)(3) of this section lists specific exceptions to the general definition of ocean activity. Activities that constitute ocean activity include but are not limited to—
(A) Performance and provision of services in international water, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section;
(B) Leasing of equipment located in international water, including underwater cables;
(C) Licensing of technology or other intangibles for use in international water;
(D) Production, processing, or creation of property in international water, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section;
(E) Activity occurring in international water that is characterized as communications activity (other than international communications activity) under § 1.863-9(h)(1);
(F) Underwriting income from the insurance of risks on activities that produce ocean income;
(G) Sales of property in international water (see § 1.861-7(c));
(H) Any activity performed in Antarctica;
(I) The leasing of a vessel that does not transport cargo or persons for hire between ports-of-call (for example, the leasing of a vessel to engage in research activities in international water); and
(J) The leasing of drilling rigs, extraction of minerals, and performance and provision of services related thereto, except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.
(2)
Determining a space or ocean activity
—(i)
Production of property in space or international water.
For purposes of this section, production activity means an activity that creates, fabricates, manufactures, extracts, processes, cures, or ages property within the meaning of section 864(a) and § 1.864-1.
(ii)
Special rule for performance of services
—(A)
General.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, if a transaction is characterized as the performance of a service, then such service will be treated as a space or ocean activity in its entirety when any part of the service is performed in space or international water. Services are performed in space or international water if functions are performed, resources are employed, or risks are assumed in space or international water, regardless of whether performed by personnel, equipment, or otherwise.
(B)
Exception to the general rule.
If the taxpayer can demonstrate the value of the service attributable to performance occurring in space or international water, and the value of the service attributable to performance occurring outside space and international water, then such service will be treated as space or ocean activity only to the extent of the activity performed in space or international water. The value of the service is attributable to performance occurring in space or international water to the extent the performance of the service, based on all the facts and circumstances, is attributable to functions performed, resources employed, or risks assumed in space or international water. In addition, if the taxpayer can demonstrate, based on all the facts and circumstances, that the value of the service attributable to performance in space and international water is de minimis, such service will not be treated as space or ocean activity.
(3)
Exceptions to space or ocean activity.
Space or ocean activity does not include the following types of activities:
(i) Any activity giving rise to transportation income as defined in section 863(c).
(ii) Any activity with respect to mines, oil and gas wells, or other natural deposits, to the extent the mines, wells, or natural deposits are located within the jurisdiction (as recognized by the United States) of any country, including the United States and its possessions.
(iii) Any activity giving rise to international communications income as defined in § 1.863-9(h)(3)(ii).
(e)
Treatment of partnerships.
This section is applied at the partner level.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:
(1)
Example 1. Space activity—activity occurring on land and in space—
(i)
Facts.
S, a United States person, owns satellites in orbit. S leases one of its satellites to A. S, as lessor, will not operate the satellite. Part of S's performance as lessor in this transaction occurs on land. Assume that the combination of S's activities is characterized as the lease of equipment.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because the leased equipment is located in space, the transaction is defined in its entirety as space activity under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. Income derived from the lease will be sourced under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's space income is sourced outside the United States to the extent the income, based on all the facts and circumstances, is attributable to functions performed, resources employed, or risks assumed in a foreign country or countries.
(2)
Example 2. Space activity—
(i)
Facts.
X is an Internet service provider. X offers a service that permits a customer (C) to connect to the Internet via a telephone call, initiated by the modem of C's personal computer, to a control center. X transmits information requested by C to C's personal computer, in part using satellite capacity leased by X from S. X performs the uplink and downlink functions. X charges its customers a flat monthly fee. Assume that neither X nor S derive international communications income within the meaning of § 1.863-9(h)(3)(ii). In addition, assume that X is able to demonstrate, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the extent to which the value of the service is attributable to functions performed, resources employed, and risks assumed in space.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the service performed by X constitutes space activity to the extent the value of the service is attributable to functions performed, resources employed, and risks assumed in space. To the extent the service performed by X constitutes space activity, the source of X's income from the service transaction is determined under paragraph (b) of this section. To the extent the service performed by X does not constitute space or ocean activity, the source of X's income from the service is determined under sections 861, 862, and 863, as applicable. To the extent that X derives space and ocean income that is also communications income within the meaning of § 1.863-9(h)(2), the source of X's income is determined under paragraph (b) of this section and § 1.863-9(c), (d), and (f), as applicable, as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. S derives space and ocean income that is also communications income within the meaning of § 1.863-9(h)(2), and the source of S's income is therefore determined under paragraph (b) of this section and § 1.863-9(c), (d), and (f), as applicable, as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(3)
Example 3. Services as space activity—de minimis value attributable to performance occurring in space—
(i)
Facts.
R owns a retail outlet in the United States. R engages S to provide a security system for R's premises. S operates its security system by transmitting images from R's premises directly to a satellite, and from the satellite to a group of S employees located in Country B, who monitor the premises by viewing the transmitted images. The satellite is used as a medium of delivery and not as a method of surveillance. O provides S with transponder capacity on O's satellite, which S uses to transmit those images. Assume that S's transaction with R is characterized as the performance of a service. Assume that O's provision of transponder capacity is also viewed as the provision of a service. Assume also that S is able to demonstrate, pursuant to § 1.863-9(h)(1), that the value of the transaction with R attributable to communications activities is de minimis.
(ii)
Analysis.
S derives income from providing monitoring services. S can demonstrate, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, that based on all the facts and circumstances, the value of S's service transaction attributable to performance in space is de minimis. Thus, S is not treated as engaged in a space activity, and none of S's income from the service transaction is space income. In addition, because S demonstrates that the value of the transaction with R attributable to communications activities is de minimis, S is not required under § 1.863-9(h)(1)(ii) to treat the transaction as separate communications and non-communications transactions, and none of S's gross income from the transaction is treated as communications income within the meaning of § 1.863-9(h)(2). O's provision of transponder capacity is viewed as the provision of a service. Based on all the facts and circumstances, the value of O's service transaction attributable to performance in space is not de minimis. Thus, O's activity will be considered space activity, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, to the extent the value of the services transaction is attributable to performance in space (unless O's activity in space is international communications activity). To the extent that O derives communications income, the source of such income is determined under paragraph (b) of this section and § 1.863-9(b), (c), (d), and (f), as applicable, as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. R does not derive any income from space activity.
(4)
Example 4. Space activity—
(i)
Facts.
L, a domestic corporation, offers programming and certain other services to customers located both in the United States and in foreign countries. Assume that L's provision of programming and other services in paragraph (f)(4)(i) (
Example 4
) is characterized as the provision of a service, and that no part of the service transaction occurs in space or international water. Assume that the delivery of the programming constitutes a separate transaction also characterized as the performance of a service. L uses satellite capacity acquired from S to deliver the
programming service directly to customers' television sets. L performs the uplink and downlink functions, so that part of the value of the delivery transaction derives from functions performed and resources employed in space. Assume that these contributions to the value of the delivery transaction occurring in space are not considered de minimis under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. Customer C pays L to provide and deliver programming to C's residence in the United States. Assume S's provision of satellite capacity in paragraph (f)(4)(i) (
Example 4
) is viewed as the provision of a service, and also that S does not derive international communications income within the meaning of § 1.863-9(h)(3)(ii).
(ii)
Analysis.
S's activity will be considered space activity. To the extent that S derives space and ocean income that is also communications income under § 1.863-9(h)(2), the source of S's income is determined under paragraph (b) of this section and § 1.863-9(c), (d), and (f), as applicable, as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. On these facts, L's activities are treated as two separate service transactions: the provision of programming (and other services), and the delivery of programming. L's income derived from provision of programming and other services is not income derived from space activity. L's delivery of programming and other services is considered space activity, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, to the extent the value of the delivery transaction is attributable to performance in space. To the extent that the delivery of programming is treated as a space activity, the source of L's income derived from the delivery transaction is determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. To the extent that L derives space and ocean income that is also communications income within the meaning of § 1.863-9(h)(2), the source of such income is determined under paragraph (b) of this section and § 1.863-9(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f), as applicable, as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(5)
Example 5. Space activity—
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 4
), except that L does not deliver the programming service directly but instead engages R, a domestic corporation specializing in content delivery, to deliver by transmission its programming. For all portions of a transmission which require satellite capacity, R, in turn, contracts out such functions to S. S performs the uplink and downlink functions, so that part of the value of the delivery transaction derives from functions performed and resources employed in space.
(ii)
Analysis.
L's activity will not be considered space activity because none of L's activity occurs in space. Thus, L does not derive any space and ocean income. L does, however, derive communications income within the meaning of § 1.863-9(h)(2). This is the case even though L does not perform the transmission function because L is paid by Customer C to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications or data. To the extent that L's activity consists in part of non-de minimis communications and non-de minimis non-communications activity, each part of the transaction must be treated as a separate transaction and gross income is allocated accordingly under § 1.863-9(h)(1)(ii). In addition, L must also allocate expenses, losses, and other deductions, for example, payments to R, to the class or classes of gross income that include the income so allocated. R's activity will not be considered space activity. Since R contracts out all of the functions involving satellite capacity to S, no part of R's activity occurs in space. Thus, R does not derive any space and ocean income. R does, however, derive communications income within the meaning of § 1.863-9(h)(2). This is the case even though R does not perform the transmission function because R is paid by L to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications or data. S's activity will be considered space activity. To the extent that S derives space and ocean income that is also communications income within the meaning of § 1.863-9(h)(2), the source of such income is determined under paragraph (b) of this section and
§ 1.863-9(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f), as applicable, as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(6)
Example 6. Space activity—treatment of land activity—
(i)
Facts.
S, a United States person, offers remote imaging products and services to its customers. In year 1, S uses its satellite's remote sensors to gather data on certain geographical terrain. In year 3, C, a construction development company, contracts with S to obtain a satellite image of an area for site development work. S pulls data from its archives and transfers to C the images gathered in year 1, in a transaction that is characterized as a sale of the data. S's rights, title, and interest in the data pass to C in the United States. Before transferring the images to C, S uses computer software in its land-based office to enhance the images so that the images can be used.
(ii)
Analysis.
The collection of data and creation of images in space is characterized as the creation of property in space. Because S both produces and sells the data, the source of the gross income from the sale of the data is determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section solely on the basis of the production activities. The source of S's gross income is determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section because production activities occur both in space and on land.
(7)
Example 7. Use of intangible property in space—
(i)
Facts.
X acquires a license to use a particular satellite slot or orbit, which X sublicenses to C. C pays X a royalty.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because the royalty is paid for the right to use intangible property in space, the source of the royalty paid by C to X is determined under paragraph (b) of this section.
(8)
Example 8. Performance of services—
(i)
Facts.
E, a domestic corporation, operates satellites with sensing equipment that can determine how much heat and light particular plants emit and reflect. Based on the data, E will provide F, a U.S. farmer, a report analyzing the data, which F will use in growing crops. E analyzes the data from offices located in the United States. Assume that E's combined activities are characterized as the performance of services.
(ii)
Analysis.
Based on all the facts and circumstances, the value of E's service transaction attributable to performance in space is not de minimis. Thus, E's activities will be considered space activities, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, to the extent the value of E's service transaction is attributable to performance in space. To the extent E's service transaction constitutes a space activity, the source of E's income derived from the service transaction will be determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, by reference to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. To the extent that E's service transaction does not constitute a space or ocean activity, the source of E's income derived from the service transaction is determined under sections 861, 862, and 863, as applicable.
(9)
Example 9. Separate transactions—
(i)
Facts.
The same facts as in paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 8
), except that E provides the raw data to F in a transaction characterized as a sale of a copyrighted article. In addition, E provides an analysis in the form of a report to F. The price F pays E for the raw data is separately stated.
(ii)
Analysis.
To the extent that the provision of raw data and the analysis of the data are each treated as separate transactions, the source of income from the production and sale of data is determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The provision of services would be analyzed in the same manner as in paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section (the analysis in
Example 8
).
(10)
Example 10. Sale of property in international water—
(i)
Facts.
T purchased and owns transatlantic cable that lies in international water. T sells the cable to B, with T's rights, title, and interest in the cable passing to B in international water. Assume that the transatlantic cable is not inventory property within the meaning of section 1221(a)(1).
(ii)
Analysis.
Because T's rights, title, and interest in the property pass to B in international water, the sale takes place in international water under § 1.861-7(c), and the sale transaction is ocean activity under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. The source of T's sales income is determined under
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, by reference to paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(11)
Example 11. Sale of property in space—
(i)
Facts.
S, a United States person, manufactures a satellite in the United States and sells it to a customer who is not a United States person. S's rights, title, and interest in the satellite pass to the customer in space.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because S's rights, title, and interest in the satellite pass to the customer in space, the sale takes place in space under § 1.861-7(c), and the sale transaction is space activity under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. The source of income derived from the sale of the satellite manufactured in the United States and sold in space is determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section solely on the basis of the production activities with respect to the satellite.
(12)
Example 12. Sale of property in space—
(i)
Facts.
S has a right to operate from a particular position (satellite slot or orbit) in space. S sells the right to operate from that position to P. Assume that the sale of the satellite slot is characterized as a sale of property and that S's rights, title, and interest in the satellite slot pass to P in space.
(ii)
Analysis.
The sale of the satellite slot takes place in space under § 1.861-7(c) because S's rights, title, and interest in the satellite slot pass to P in space. The sale of the satellite slot is space activity under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, and income or gain from the sale is sourced under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, by reference to paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(13)
Example 13. Source of income of a foreign person—
(i)
Facts.
FP, a foreign corporation that is not a CFC, derives income from the operation of satellites. FP operates ground stations in the United States and in foreign Country FC. Assume that FP is considered engaged in a trade or business within the United States based on FP's operation of the ground station in the United States.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, FP's space income is sourced in the United States to the extent the income, based on all the facts and circumstances, is attributable to functions performed, resources employed, or risks assumed within the United States.
(14)
Example 14. Source of income of a foreign person—
(i)
Facts.
FP, a foreign corporation that is not a CFC, operates remote sensing satellites in space to collect data and images for its customers. FP uses an independent agent, A, in the United States who provides marketing, order-taking, and other customer service functions. Assume that FP is considered engaged in a trade or business within the United States based on A's activities on FP's behalf in the United States.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, FP's space income is sourced in the United States to the extent the income, based on all the facts and circumstances, is attributable to functions performed, resources employed, or risks assumed within the United States.
(g)
Reporting and documentation requirements
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer making an allocation of gross income under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(ii), or (b)(4) of this section must satisfy the requirements in paragraphs (g)(2), (3), and (4) of this section.
(2)
Required documentation.
In all cases, a taxpayer must prepare and maintain documentation in existence when its return is filed regarding the allocation of gross income and allocation and apportionment of expenses, losses, and other deductions, the methodologies used, and the circumstances justifying use of those methodologies. The taxpayer must make available such documentation within 30 days upon request.
(3)
Access to software.
If the taxpayer or any third party used any computer software, within the meaning of section 7612(d), to allocate gross income, or to allocate or apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions, the taxpayer must make available upon request—
(i) Any computer software executable code, within the meaning of section 7612(d), used for such purposes, including an executable copy of the version of the software used in the preparation of the taxpayer's return (including any plug-ins, supplements, etc.) and a copy
of all related electronic data files. Thus, if software subsequently is upgraded or supplemented, a separate executable copy of the version used in preparing the taxpayer's return must be retained;
(ii) Any related computer software source code, within the meaning of section 7612(d), acquired or developed by the taxpayer or a related person, or primarily for internal use by the taxpayer or such person rather than for commercial distribution; and
(iii) In the case of any spreadsheet software or similar software, any formulae or links to supporting worksheets.
(4)
Use of allocation methodology.
In general, when a taxpayer allocates gross income under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(ii), or (b)(4) of this section, it does so by making the allocation on a timely filed original return (including extensions). However, a taxpayer will be permitted to make changes to such allocations made on its original return with respect to any taxable year for which the statute of limitations has not closed as follows:
(i) In the case of a taxpayer that has made a change to such allocations prior to the opening conference for the audit of the taxable year to which the allocation relates or who makes such a change within 90 days of such opening conference, if the IRS issues a written information document request asking the taxpayer to provide the documents and such other information described in paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section with respect to the changed allocations and the taxpayer complies with such request within 30 days of the request, then the IRS will complete its examination, if any, with respect to the allocations for that year as part of the current examination cycle. If the taxpayer does not provide the documents and information described in paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section within 30 days of the request, then the procedures described in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section shall apply.
(ii) If the taxpayer changes such allocations more than 90 days after the opening conference for the audit of the taxable year to which the allocations relate or the taxpayer does not provide the documents and information with respect to the changed allocations as requested in accordance with paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section, then the IRS will, in a separate cycle, determine whether an examination of the taxpayer's allocations is warranted and complete any such examination. The separate cycle will be worked as resources are available and may not have the same estimated completion date as the other issues under examination for the taxable year. The IRS may ask the taxpayer to extend the statute of limitations on assessment and collection for the taxable year to permit examination of the taxpayer's method of allocation, including an extension limited, where appropriate, to the taxpayer's method of allocation.
(h)
Applicability dates.
Except as provided in this paragraph (h), this section applies to taxable years beginning on or after December 27, 2006. The provisions in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section relating to the meaning of a CFC apply to taxable years of foreign corporations ending on or after October 1, 2019. For taxable years of foreign corporations ending before October 1, 2019, a taxpayer may apply such provisions to the last taxable year of a foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, and each subsequent taxable year of the foreign corporation, provided that the taxpayer and United States persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) to the taxpayer consistently apply such provisions with respect to all foreign corporations. For taxable years of foreign corporations ending before October 1, 2019, where the taxpayer does not apply the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section relating to the meaning of a CFC, see paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2020. Paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section applies to taxable years ending on or after December 23, 2019. However, a taxpayer may apply paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section in its entirety for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending before December 23, 2019, provided that the taxpayer and all persons related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) apply paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and §§ 1.863-1(b),
1.863-2(b), 1.863-3, 1.864-5(a) and (b), 1.864-6(c)(2), and 1.865-3 in their entirety for the taxable year, and once applied, the taxpayer and all persons related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) continue to apply these regulations in their entirety for all subsequent taxable years. For regulations generally applicable to taxable years ending before December 23, 2019, see § 1.863-8 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2020.
[T.D. 9305, 71 FR 77603, Dec. 27, 2006, as amended by T.D. 9908, 85 FR 59434, Sept. 22, 2020; T.D. 9921, 85 FR 79849, Dec. 11, 2020]
§ 1.863-9
Source of income derived from communications activity under section 863(a), (d), and (e).
(a)
In general.
Income of a United States or a foreign person derived from each type of communications activity, as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, is sourced under the rules of this section, notwithstanding any other provision including sections 861, 862, 863, and 865. Notwithstanding that a communications activity would qualify as space or ocean activity under section 863(d) and the regulations thereunder, the source of income derived from such communications activity is determined under this section, and not under section 863(d) and the regulations thereunder, except to the extent provided in § 1.863-8(b)(5).
(b)
Source of international communications income
—(1)
International communications income derived by a United States person.
Income derived from international communications activity (international communications income) by a United States person is one-half from sources within the United States and one-half from sources without the United States.
(2)
International communications income derived by foreign persons
—(i)
In general.
International communications income derived by a person other than a United States person is, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2), wholly from sources without the United States.
(ii)
International communications income derived by a controlled foreign corporation.
International communications income derived by a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is one-half from sources within the United States and one-half from sources without the United States. For purposes of this section, a CFC has the meaning provided in section 957, determined without applying section 318(a)(3)(A), (B), and (C) so as to consider a United States person as owning stock which is owned by a person who is not a United States person.
(iii)
International communications income derived by foreign persons with a fixed place of business in the United States.
International communications income derived by a foreign person, other than a CFC, that is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business of the foreign person in the United States is from sources within the United States. The principles of section 864(c)(5) apply in determining whether a foreign person has an office or fixed place of business in the United States. See § 1.864-7. International communications income is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business to the extent of functions performed, resources employed, or risks assumed by the office or other fixed place of business.
(iv)
International communications income derived by foreign persons engaged in a trade or business within the United States.
International communications income derived by a foreign person (other than a CFC) engaged in a trade or business within the United States is income from sources within the United States to the extent the income, based on all the facts and circumstances, is attributable to functions performed, resources employed, or risks assumed within the United States.
(c)
Source of U.S. communications income.
Income derived by a United States or foreign person from U.S. communications activity is from sources within the United States.
(d)
Source of foreign communications income.
Income derived by a United States or foreign person from foreign communications activity is from sources without the United States.
(e)
Source of space/ocean communications income.
The source of income derived by a United States or foreign person from space/ocean communications activity is determined under section 863(d) and the regulations thereunder.
(f)
Source of communications income when taxpayer cannot establish the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit the communication.
Income derived by a United States or foreign person from communications activity, when the taxpayer cannot establish the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit the communication as required in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, is from sources within the United States.
(g)
Taxable income.
When a taxpayer allocates gross income under paragraph (b)(2)(iii), (b)(2)(iv), or (h)(1)(ii) of this section, the taxpayer must allocate expenses, losses, and other deductions as prescribed in §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T to the class or classes of gross income that include the income so allocated in each case. A taxpayer must then apply the rules of §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T properly to apportion amounts of expenses, losses, and other deductions so allocated to such gross income between gross income from sources within the United States and gross income from sources without the United States. For amounts of expenses, losses, and other deductions allocated to gross income derived from international communications activity, when the source of income is determined under the 50/50 method of paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section, taxpayers generally must apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions between sources within the United States and sources without the United States pro rata based on the relative amounts of gross income from sources within the United States and gross income from sources without the United States. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to research and experimental expenditures qualifying under § 1.861-17, which are to be allocated and apportioned under the rules of that section.
(h)
Communications activity and income derived from communications activity
—(1)
Communications activity
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of this part,
communications activity
consists solely of the delivery by transmission of communications or data (communications). Delivery of communications other than by transmission (for example, by delivery of physical packages and letters) is not communications activity within the meaning of this section. Communications activity also includes the provision of capacity to transmit communications. Provision of content or any other additional service provided along with, or in connection with, a non-de minimis communications activity must be treated as a separate non-communications activity unless de minimis. Communications activity or non-communications activity will be treated as de minimis to the extent, based on the facts and circumstances, the value attributable to such activity is de minimis.
(ii)
Separate transaction.
To the extent that a taxpayer's transaction consists in part of non-de minimis communications activity and in part of non-de minimis non-communications activity, each such part of the transaction must be treated as a separate transaction. Gross income is allocated to each such communications activity transaction and non-communications activity transaction to the extent the income, based on all the facts and circumstances, is attributable to functions performed, resources employed, or risks assumed in each such activity.
(2)
Income derived from communications activity. Income derived from communications activity
(communications income) is income derived from the delivery by transmission of communications, including income derived from the provision of capacity to transmit communications. Income may be considered derived from a communications activity even if the taxpayer itself does not perform the transmission function, but in all cases, the taxpayer derives communications income only if the taxpayer is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications.
(3)
Determining the type of communications activity
—(i)
In general.
Whether income is derived from international communications activity, U.S. communications activity, foreign communications activity, or space/ocean communications activity is determined by identifying the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit the communication. The taxpayer must establish the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit,
and bears the risk of transmitting, the communication. Whether the taxpayer contracts out part or all of the transmission function is not relevant. A taxpayer may satisfy the requirement that the taxpayer establish the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communication by using any consistently applied reasonable method to establish one or both endpoints. In evaluating the reasonableness of such method, consideration will be given to all the facts and circumstances, including whether the endpoints would otherwise be identifiable absent this reasonable method provision and the reliability of the data. Depending on the facts and circumstances, methods based on, for example, records of port or transport charges, customer billing records, a satellite footprint, or records of termination fees made pursuant to an international settlement agreement may be reasonable. In addition, practices used by taxpayers to classify or categorize certain communications activity in connection with preparation of statements and analyses for the use of management, creditors, minority shareholders, joint ventures, or other parties or governmental agencies in interest may be reliable indicators of the reasonableness of the method chosen, but need not be accorded conclusive weight by the Commissioner. In all cases, the method chosen to establish the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communication must be supported by sufficient documentation to permit verification by the Commissioner.
(ii)
Income derived from international communications activity. Income derived by a taxpayer from international communications activity
(international communications income) is income derived from communications activity, as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, when the taxpayer is paid to transmit—
(A) Between a point in the United States and a point in a foreign country (or a possession of the United States); or
(B) Foreign-originating communications (communications with a beginning point in a foreign country or a possession of the United States) from a point in space or international water to a point in the United States.
(iii)
Income derived from U.S. communications activity.
Income derived by a taxpayer from U.S. communications activity (U.S. communications income) is income derived from communications activity, as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, when the taxpayer is paid to transmit—
(A) Between two points in the United States; or
(B) Between the United States and a point in space or international water, except as provided in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(iv)
Income derived from foreign communications activity. Income derived by a taxpayer from foreign communications activity
(foreign communications income) is income derived from communications activity, as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, when the taxpayer is paid to transmit—
(A) Between two points in a foreign country or countries (or a possession or possessions of the United States);
(B) Between a foreign country and a possession of the United States; or
(C) Between a foreign country (or a possession of the United States) and a point in space or international water.
(v)
Income derived from space/ocean communications activity. Income derived by a taxpayer from space/ocean communications activity
(space/ocean communications income) is income derived from communications activity, as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, when the taxpayer is paid to transmit between a point in space or international water and another point in space or international water.
(i)
Treatment of partnerships.
This section is applied at the partner level.
(j)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1. Income derived from non-communications activity—remote data base access.
(i)
Facts.
D provides its customers in various foreign countries with access to its data base, which contains information on certain individuals' health care insurance coverage. Customer C obtains access to D's data base by placing a call to D's telephone number. Assume that C's telephone service, used to access D's data base, is provided by a third party, and that D assumes no responsibility
for the transmission of the information via telephone.
(ii)
Analysis.
D is not paid to transmit communications and does not derive income from communications activity within the meaning of paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Rather, D derives income from provision of content or provision of services to its customers. Therefore, the rules of this section do not apply to determine the source of D's income.

# Example 2. Income derived from U.S. communications activity—U.S. portion of international communication.
(i)
Facts.
TC, a local telephone company, receives an access fee from an international carrier for picking up a call from a local telephone customer and delivering the call to a U.S. point of presence (POP) of the international carrier. The international carrier picks up the call from its U.S. POP and delivers the call to a foreign country.
(ii)
Analysis.
TC is not paid to carry the transmission between the United States and a foreign country. TC is paid to transmit a communication between two points in the United States. TC derives U.S. communications income as defined in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section, which is sourced under paragraph (c) of this section as U.S. source income.

# Example 3. Income derived from international communications activity—underwater cable.
(i)
Facts.
TC, a domestic corporation, owns an underwater fiber optic cable. Pursuant to contracts, TC makes available to its customers capacity to transmit communications via the cable. TC's customers then solicit telephone customers and arrange to transmit the telephone customers' calls. The cable runs in part through U.S. waters, in part through international waters, and in part through foreign country waters.
(ii) Analysis. TC derives international communications income as defined in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section because TC is paid to make available capacity to transmit communications between the United States and a foreign country. Because TC is a United States person, TC's international communications income is sourced under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as one-half from sources within the United States and one-half from sources without the United States.

# Example 4. Income derived from international communications activity—satellite.
(i)
Facts.
S, a United States person, owns satellites in orbit and uplink facilities in Country X, a foreign country. B, a resident of Country X, pays S to deliver B's programming from S's uplink facility, located in Country X, to a downlink facility in the United States owned by C, a customer of B.
(ii)
Analysis.
S derives international communications income under paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section because S is paid to transmit the communications between a beginning point in a foreign country and an endpoint in the United States. Because S is a United States person, the source of S's international communications income is determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as one-half from sources within the United States and one-half from sources without the United States.

# Example 5. The paid-to-do rule—foreign communications via domestic route.
(i)
Facts.
TC is paid to transmit communications from Toronto, Canada, to Paris, France. TC transmits the communications from Toronto to New York. TC pays another communications company, IC, to transmit the communications from New York to Paris.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under the
paid-to-do
rule of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, TC derives foreign communications income under paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section because TC is paid to transmit communications between two points in foreign countries, Toronto and Paris. Under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, the character of TC's communications activity is determined without regard to the fact that TC pays IC to transmit the communications for some portion of the delivery path. IC has international communications income under paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section because IC is paid to transmit the communications between a point in the United States and a point in a foreign country.

# Example 6. The paid-to-do rule—domestic communication via foreign route.
(i)
Facts.
TC is paid to transmit a call between two points in the United States, but routes the call through Canada.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, the character of income derived from communications activity is determined by the two points between which the taxpayer is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications, without regard to the path of the transmission between those two points. Thus, under paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section, TC derives income from U.S. communications activity because it is paid to transmit the communications between two U.S. points.

# Example 7. The paid-to-do rule—foreign-originating communications.
(i)
Facts.
Under an international settlement agreement, G, a Country X international carrier, pays T to receive all calls originating in Country X that are bound for the United States and to terminate such calls in the United States. Due to Country X legal restrictions, the international settlement agreement specifies that G carries the transmission to a point outside the territory of Country X and that T carries the foreign-originating transmission from such point to the destined point in the United States. T, in turn, contracts out with another communications company, S, to transmit the U.S. portion of
the communications. Tracing and identifying the endpoints of each transmission is not possible or practical. T does, however, keep records of termination fees received from G for terminating the foreign-originating calls.
(ii)
Analysis.
T derives communications income as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Based on all the facts and circumstances, T can establish that T is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, foreign-originating calls from a point in space or international water to a point in the United States using a reasonable method to establish the endpoints, assuming that this method is consistently applied. In this case, T can reasonably establish that T is paid to receive foreign-originating calls and terminate such calls in the United States based on the records of termination fees pursuant to an international settlement agreement. Under paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, a taxpayer derives income from international communications activity when the taxpayer is paid to transmit foreign-originating communications from space or international water to the United States. Thus, under paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, T derives income from international communications. If, based on all the facts and circumstances, T could reasonably trace and identify the endpoints, then T would have to directly establish that each call originated in a foreign country. Assuming T is able to do so, the rest of the analysis in this
Example 7
remains the same. Under paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section, S derives income from U.S. communications activity because S is paid to transmit the communications between two U.S. points.

# Example 8. Indeterminate endpoints—prepaid telephone calling cards.
(i)
Facts.
S purchases capacity from TC to transmit telephone calls. S sells prepaid telephone calling cards that give customers access to TC's telephone lines for a certain number of minutes. Assume that S cannot establish the endpoints of its customers' telephone calls, even under the reasonable method rule of paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
S derives communications income as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section because S makes capacity to transmit communications available to its customers. In this case, S cannot establish the two points between which the communications are transmitted. Therefore, S's communications income is U.S. source income, as provided by paragraph (f) of this section.

# Example 9. Reasonable methods—minutes of use data on long distance calling plans.
(i)
Facts.
B provides both domestic and international long distance services in a calling plan for a limited number of minutes for a set amount each month. Tracing and identifying the endpoints of each transmission is not possible or practical. B is, however, able to establish that the calling plan generated $10,000 of revenue for 25,000 minutes based on reports derived from customer billing records. Based on minutes of use data in these reports, B is able to establish that of the total 25,000 minutes, 60 percent or 15,000 minutes were for U.S. long distance calls and 40 percent or 10,000 minutes were for international calls.
(ii)
Analysis.
B derives communications income as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Based on all the facts and circumstances, B can establish the two points between which B is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications using a reasonable method to establish the endpoints, assuming that this method is consistently applied. In this case, B can reasonably establish that 60 percent of the income derived from the long distance calling plan is U.S. communications income and 40 percent is international communications income based on the minutes of use data derived from customer billing records to establish the endpoints of the communications. If, based on all the facts and circumstances, B could reasonably trace and identify the endpoints, then B would have to directly identify the endpoints between which B is paid to transmit the communications.

# Example 10. Reasonable methods—system design.
(i)
Facts.
D operates satellites which are designed to transmit signals through two separate ranges of signal frequencies (bands). Due to technological limitations, requirements, and practicalities, one band is designed to only transmit signals within the United States. The other band is designed to transmit signals between foreign countries and the United States. D cannot trace and identify the endpoints of each individual transmission. D does, however, track the total transmission through each band and the total income derived from transmitting signals through each band.
(ii)
Analysis.
D derives communications income as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Based on all the facts and circumstances, D can establish the two points between which D is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications using a reasonable method to establish endpoints, assuming that this method is consistently applied. In this case, D can reasonably establish that income derived from transmissions through the first band is U.S. communications income and income derived from transmissions through the second band is international communications income based on the design of the bands to establish the endpoints of the communications.

# Example 11. Reasonable methods—port locations.
(i)
Facts.
X provides its customer, C, with a virtual private network (VPN) so that C's U.S. headquarter office can connect and
communicate with offices in the United States, Country X, Country Y, and Country Z. Assume that the VPN is only for communications with the U.S. headquarter office. X cannot trace and identify the endpoints of each transmission. C pays X a set amount each month for the entire service, regardless of the magnitude of the usage or the geographic points between which C uses the service.
(ii)
Analysis.
X derives communications income as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Based on the facts and circumstances, X can establish the two points between which X is paid to transmit, and bears the risk of transmitting, the communications using a reasonable method to establish endpoints, assuming that this method is consistently applied. In this case, X can reasonably establish that one-fourth of the income derived from the VPN service is U.S. communications income and three-fourths is international communications income based on the location of the VPN ports to establish the endpoints of the communications.

# Example 12. Indeterminate endpoints—Internet access.
(i)
Facts.
B, a domestic corporation, is an Internet service provider. B charges its customer, C, a monthly lump sum for Internet access. C accesses the Internet via a telephone call, initiated by the modem of C's personal computer, to one of B's control centers, which serves as C's portal to the Internet. B transmits data sent by C from B's control center in France to a recipient in England, over the Internet. B does not maintain records as to the beginning and endpoints of the transmission.
(ii)
Analysis.
B derives communications income as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The source of B's communications income is determined under paragraph (f) of this section as income from sources within the United States because B cannot establish the two points between which it is paid to transmit the communications.

# Example 13. De minimis non-communications activity.
(i)
Facts.
The same facts as in Example 12.
Assume in addition that B replicates frequently requested sites on B's own servers, solely to speed up response time. Assume that B's replication of frequently requested sites would be considered a de minimis non-communications activity under this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
On these facts, because B's replication of frequently requested sites would be considered a
de minimis
non-communications activity, B is not required to treat the replication activity as a separate non-communications activity transaction under paragraph (h)(1) of this section. B derives communications income under paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The character and source of B's communications income are determined by demonstrating the points between which B is paid to transmit the communications, under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section.

# Example 14. Income derived from communications and non-communications activity—bundled services.
(i)
Facts.
A, a domestic corporation, offers customers local and long distance phone service, video, and Internet services. Customers pay a flat monthly fee plus 10 cents a minute for all long-distance calls, including international calls.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, to the extent that A's transaction with its customer consists in part of non-de minimis communications activity and in part of non-de minimis non-communications activity, each such part of the transaction must be treated as a separate transaction. A's gross income from the transaction is allocated to each such communications activity transaction and non-communications activity transaction in accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section. To the extent A can establish that it derives international communications income as defined in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section, A would determine the source of such income under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If A cannot establish the points between which it is paid to transmit communications, as required by paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, A's communications income is from sources within the United States, as provided by paragraph (f) of this section.

# Example 15. Income derived from communications and non-communications activity.
(i)
Facts.
B, a domestic corporation, is paid by D, a cable system operator in Foreign Country, to provide television programs and to transmit the television programs to Foreign Country. Using its own satellite transponder, B transmits the television programs from the United States to downlink facilities owned by D in Foreign Country. D receives the transmission, unscrambles the signals, and distributes the broadcast to D's customers in Foreign Country. Assume that B's provision of television programs is a non-de minimis non-communications activity, and that B's transmission of television programs is a non-de minimis communications activity.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, B must treat its communications and non-communications activities as separate transactions. B's gross income is allocated to each such separate communications and non-communications activity transaction in accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section. Income derived by B from the transmission of television programs to D's Foreign Country downlink facility is international communications income as defined in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section because B is paid to transmit communications from the United States to a foreign country.

# Example 16. Income derived from foreign communications activity.
(i)
Facts.
STS provides satellite capacity to B, a broadcaster located in Australia. B beams programming from Australia to the satellite. S's satellite picks the communications up in space and beams the programming over a footprint covering Southeast Asia.
(ii)
Analysis.
S derives communications income as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. S's income is characterized as foreign communications income under paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section because S picks up the communication in space, and beams it to a footprint entirely covering a foreign area. Under paragraph (d) of this section, S's foreign communications income is from sources without the United States. If S were beaming the programming over a satellite footprint that covered area both in the United States and outside the United States, S would be required to allocate the income derived from the different types of communications activity.
(k)
Reporting and documentation requirements
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer making an allocation of gross income under paragraph (b)(2)(iii), (b)(2)(iv), or (h)(1)(ii) of this section must satisfy the requirements in paragraphs (k)(2), (3), and (4) of this section.
(2)
Required documentation.
In all cases, a taxpayer must prepare and maintain documentation in existence when its return is filed regarding the allocation of gross income, and allocation and apportionment of expenses, losses, and other deductions, the methodologies used, and the circumstances justifying use of those methodologies. The taxpayer must make available such documentation within 30 days upon request.
(3)
Access to software.
If the taxpayer or any third party used any computer software, within the meaning of section 7612(d), to allocate gross income, or to allocate or apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions, the taxpayer must make available upon request—
(i) Any computer software executable code, within the meaning of section 7612(d), used for such purposes, including an executable copy of the version of the software used in the preparation of the taxpayer's return (including any plug-ins, supplements, etc.) and a copy of all related electronic data files. Thus, if software subsequently is upgraded or supplemented, a separate executable copy of the version used in preparing the taxpayer's return must be retained;
(ii) Any related computer software source code, within the meaning of section 7612(d), acquired or developed by the taxpayer or a related person, or primarily for internal use by the taxpayer or such person rather than for commercial distribution; and
(iii) In the case of any spreadsheet software or similar software, any formulae or links to supporting worksheets.
(4)
Use of allocation methodology.
In general, when a taxpayer allocates gross income under paragraph (b)(2)(iii), (b)(2)(iv), or (h)(1)(ii) of this section, it does so by making the allocation on a timely filed original return (including extensions). However, a taxpayer will be permitted to make changes to such allocations made on its original return with respect to any taxable year for which the statute of limitations has not closed as follows:
(i) In the case of a taxpayer that has made a change to such allocations prior to the opening conference for the audit of the taxable year to which the allocation relates or who makes such a change within 90 days of such opening conference, if the IRS issues a written information document request asking the taxpayer to provide the documents and such other information described in paragraphs (k)(2) and (3) of this section with respect to the changed allocations and the taxpayer complies with such request within 30 days of the request, then the IRS will complete its examination, if any, with respect to the allocations for that year as part of the current examination cycle. If the taxpayer does not provide the documents and information described in paragraphs (k)(2) and (3) of this section within 30 days of the request, then the procedures described in paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section shall apply.
(ii) If the taxpayer changes such allocations more than 90 days after the opening conference for the audit of the taxable year to which the allocations relate or the taxpayer does not provide the documents and information with respect to the changed allocations as requested in accordance with paragraphs (k)(2) and (3) of this section,
then the IRS will, in a separate cycle, determine whether an examination of the taxpayer's allocations is warranted and complete any such examination. The separate cycle will be worked as resources are available and may not have the same estimated completion date as the other issues under examination for the taxable year. The IRS may ask the taxpayer to extend the statute of limitations on assessment and collection for the taxable year to permit examination of the taxpayer's method of allocation, including an extension limited, where appropriate, to the taxpayer's method of allocation.
(l)
Applicability dates.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (l), this section applies to taxable years beginning on or after December 27, 2006. The provisions in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section relating to the meaning of a CFC apply to taxable years of foreign corporations ending on or after October 1, 2019. For taxable years of foreign corporations ending before October 1, 2019, a taxpayer may apply such provisions to the last taxable year of a foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, and each subsequent taxable year of the foreign corporation, provided that the taxpayer and United States persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) to the taxpayer consistently apply such provisions with respect to all foreign corporations. For taxable years of foreign corporations ending before October 1, 2019, where the taxpayer does not apply the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section relating to the meaning of a CFC, see paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2020.

§ 1.863-10
Source of income from a qualified fails charge.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the source of income from a qualified fails charge shall be determined by reference to the residence of the taxpayer as determined under section 988(a)(3)(B)(i).
(b)
Qualified business unit exception.
The source of income from a qualified fails charge shall be determined by reference to the residence of a qualified business unit (as defined in section 989) of a taxpayer if—
(1) The taxpayer's residence, determined under section 988(a)(3)(B)(i), is the United States;
(2) The qualified business unit's residence, determined under section 988(a)(3)(B)(ii), is outside the United States;
(3) The qualified business unit is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the country where it is a resident; and
(4) The transaction to which the qualified fails charge relates is attributable to the qualified business unit.

(c)
Effectively connected income exception.
Qualified fails charge income that arises from a transaction any income from which is (or would be if the transaction produced income) effectively connected with a United States trade or business pursuant to § 1.864-4(c) is treated as from sources within the United States, and the income from the qualified fails charge is treated as effectively connected to the conduct of a United States trade or business.
(d)
Qualified fails charge.
For purposes of this section, a qualified fails charge is a payment that—
(1) Compensates a party to a transaction that provides for delivery of a designated security (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) in exchange for the payment of cash (delivery-versus-payment settlement) for another party's failure to deliver the specified designated security on the settlement date specified in the relevant agreement; and
(2) Is made pursuant to—
(i) A trading practice or similar guidance approved or adopted by either an agency of the United States government or the Treasury Market Practices Group, or
(ii) Any trading practice, program, policy or procedure approved by the
Commissioner in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(e)
Designated security.
For purposes of this section, a
designated security

§ 1.864-1
Meaning of sale, etc.
For purposes of §§ 1.861 through 1.864-7, the word “sale” includes “exchange”; the word “sold” includes “exchanged”; the word “produced” includes “created”, “fabricated”, “manufactured”, “extracted”, “processed”, “cured”, and “aged”.
[T.D. 6948, 33 FR 5090, Mar. 28, 1968]
§ 1.864-2
Trade or business within the United States.
(a)
In general.
As used in part I (section 861 and following) and part II (section 871 and following), subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code, and chapter 3 (section 1441 and following) of the Code, and the regulations thereunder, the term “engaged in trade or business within the United States” does not include the activities described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, but includes the performance of personal services within the United States at any time within the taxable year except to the extent otherwise provided in this section.
(b)
Performance of personal services for foreign employer
—(1)
Excepted services.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term “engaged in trade or business within the United States” does not include the performance of personal services—
(i) For a nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation, not engaged in trade or business within the United States at any time during the taxable year, or
(ii) For an office or place of business maintained in a foreign country or in a possession of the United States by an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States or by a domestic partnership or a domestic corporation, by a nonresident alien individual who is temporarily present in the United States for a period or periods not exceeding a total of 90 days during the taxable year and whose compensation for such services does not exceed in the aggregate gross amount of $3,000.
(2)
Rules of application.
(i) As a general rule, the term “day”, as used in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, means a calendar day during any portion of which the nonresident alien individual is physically present in the United States.
(ii) Solely for purposes of applying this paragraph, the nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation for which the nonresident alien individual is performing personal services in the United States shall not be considered to be engaged in trade or business in the United States by reason of the performance of such services by such individual.
(iii) In applying subparagraph (1) of this paragraph it is immaterial whether the services performed by the nonresident alien individual are performed as an employee for his employer or under any form of contract with the person for whom the services are performed.
(iv) In determining for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph whether compensation received by the nonresident alien individual exceeds in the aggregate a gross amount of $3,000, any amounts received by the individual from an employer as advances or reimbursements for travel expenses incurred on behalf of the employer shall be omitted from the compensation received by the individual, to the extent of expenses incurred, where he was required to account and did account to his employer for such expenses and has
met the tests for such accounting provided in § 1.162-17 and paragraph (e)(4) of § 1.274-5. If advances or reimbursements exceed such expenses, the amount of the excess shall be included as compensation for personal services for purposes of such subparagraph. Pensions and retirement pay attributable to personal services performed in the United States are not to be taken into account for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(v) See section 7701(a)(5) and § 301.7701-5 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations) for the meaning of “foreign” when applied to a corporation or partnership.
(vi) As to the source of compensation for personal services, see §§ 1.861-4 and 1.862-1.
(3)
Illustrations.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
During 1967, A, a nonresident alien individual, is employed by the London office of a domestic partnership. A, who uses the calendar year as his taxable year, is temporarily present in the United States during 1967 for 60 days performing personal service in the United States for the London office of the partnership and is paid by that office a total gross salary of $2,600 for such services. During 1967, A is not engaged in trade or business in the United States solely by reason of his performing such personal services for the London office of the domestic partnership.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that A's total gross salary for the services performed in the United States during 1967 amounts to $3,500, of which $2,625 is received in 1967 and $875 is received in 1968. During 1967, is engaged in trade or business in the United States by reason of his performance of personal services in the United States.
(c)
Trading in stocks or securities.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section—
(1)
In general.
The term “engaged in trade or business within the United States” does not include the effecting of transactions in the United States in stocks or securities through a resident broker, commission agent, custodian, or other independent agent. This subparagraph shall apply to any taxpayer, including a broker or dealer in stocks or securities, except that it shall not apply if at any time during the taxable year the taxpayer has an office or other fixed place of business in the United States through which, or by the direction of which, the transactions in stocks or securities are effected. The volume of stock or security transactions effected during the taxable year shall not be taken into account in determining under this subparagraph whether the taxpayer is engaged in trade or business within the United States.
(2)
Trading for taxpayer's own account
—(i)
In general.
The term “engaged in trade or business within the United States” does not include the effecting of transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for the taxpayer's own account, irrespective of whether such transactions are effected by or through—
(
a
) The taxpayer himself while present in the United States,
(
b
) Employees of the taxpayer, whether or not such employees are present in the United States while effecting the transactions, or
(
c
) A broker, commission agent, custodian, or other agent of the taxpayer, whether or not such agent while effecting the transactions is (
1
) dependent or independent, or (
2
) resident, nonresident, or present, in the United States, and irrespective of whether any such employee or agent has discretionary authority to make decisions in effecting such transactions. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “securities” means any note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness, or any evidence of an interest in or right to subscribe to or purchase any of the foregoing; and the effecting of transactions in stocks or securities includes buying, selling (whether or not by entering into short sales), or trading in stocks, securities, or contracts or options to buy or sell stocks or securities, on margin or otherwise, for the account and risk of the taxpayer, and any other activity closely related thereto (such as obtaining credit for the purpose of effectuating such buying, selling, or trading). The volume of stock of security transactions effected during the taxable year shall not be taken into account in determining under this subparagraph whether the
taxpayer is engaged in trade or business within the United States. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A, a nonresident alien individual who is not a dealer in stocks or securities, authorizes B, an individual resident of the United States, as his agent to effect transactions in the United States in stocks and securities for the account of A. B is empowered with complete authority to trade in stocks and securities for the account of A and to use his own discretion as to when to buy or sell for A's account. This grant of discretionary authority from A to B is also communicated in writing by A to various domestic brokerage firms through which A ordinarily effects transactions in the United States in stocks or securities. Under the agency arrangement B has the authority to place orders with the brokers, and all confirmations are to be made by the brokers to B, subject to his approval. The brokers are authorized by A to make payments to B and to charge such payments to the account of A. In addition, B is authorized to obtain and advance the necessary funds, if any, to maintain credits with the brokerage firms. Pursuant to his authority B carries on extensive trading transactions in the United States during the taxable year through the various brokerage firms for the account of A. During the taxable year A makes several visits to the United States in order to discuss with B various aspects of his trading activities and to make necessary changes in his trading policy. A is not engaged in trade or business within the United States during the taxable year solely because of the effecting by B of transactions in the United States in stocks or securities during such year for the account of A.
(ii)
Partnerships.
A nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, foreign estate, foreign trust, or foreign corporation shall not be considered to be engaged in trade or business within the United States solely because such person is a member of a partnership (whether domestic or foreign) which, pursuant to discretionary authority granted to such partnership by such person, effects transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for the partnership's own account or solely because an employee of such partnership, or a broker, commission agent, custodian, or other agent, pursuant to discretionary authority granted by such partnership, effects transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for the account of such partnership. This subdivision shall not apply, however, to any member of (
a
) a partnership which is a dealer in stocks or securities or (
b
) a partnership (other than a partnership in which, at any time during the last half of its taxable year, more than 50 percent of either the capital interest or the profits interest is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer partners who are individuals) the principal business of which is trading in stocks or securities for its own account, if the principal office of such partnership is in the United States at any time during the taxable year. The principles of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for determining whether a foreign corporation has its principal office in the United States shall apply in determining under this subdivision whether a partnership has its principal office in the United States. See section 707(b)(3) and paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.707-1 for rules for determining the extent of the ownership by a partner of a capital interest or profits interest in a partnership. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
B, a nonresident alien individual, is a member of partnership X, the members of which are U.S. citizens, nonresident alien individuals, and foreign corporations. The principal business of partnership X is trading in stocks or securities for its own account. Pursuant to discretionary authority granted by B, partnership X effects transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for its own account. Partnership X is not a dealer in stocks or securities, and more than 50 percent of either the capital interest or the profits interest in partnership X is owned throughout its taxable year by five or fewer partners who are individuals. B is not engaged in trade or business within the United States solely by reason of such effecting of transactions in the United States in stocks or securities by partnership X for its own account.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that not more than 50 percent of either the capital interest or the profits interest in partnership X is owned throughout the taxable year by five or fewer partners who are individuals. However, partnership X does not maintain its principal office in the United States at any time during the taxable year. B is not engaged in trade or business within the United States solely by reason of the trading in stocks or securities by partnership X for its own account.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that, pursuant to discretionary authority granted by partnership X, domestic broker D effects transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for the account of partnership X. B is not engaged in trade or business in the United States solely by reason of such trading in stocks or securities for the account of partnership X.
(iii)
Dealers in stocks or securities and certain foreign corporations.
This subparagraph shall not apply to the effecting of transactions in the United States for the account of (
a
) a dealer in stocks or securities or (
b
) a foreign corporation (other than a corporation which is, or but for section 542(c)(7) or 543(b)(1)(C) would be, a personal holding company) the principal business of which is trading in stocks or securities for its own account, if the principal office of such corporation is in the United States at any time during the taxable year. Whether a foreign corporation's principal office is in the United States for this purpose is to be determined by comparing the activities (other than trading in stocks or securities) which the corporation conducts from its office or other fixed place of business located in the United States with the activities it conducts from its offices or other fixed places of business located outside the United States. For purposes of this subdivision, a foreign corporation is considered to have only one principal office, and an office of such corporation will not be considered to be its principal office merely because it is a statutory office of such corporation. For example, a foreign corporation which carries on most or all of its investment activities in the United States but maintains a general business office or offices outside the United States in which its management is located will not be considered as having its principal office in the United States if all or a substantial portion of the following functions is carried on at or from an office or offices located outside the United States:
(
1
) Communicating with its shareholders (including the furnishing of financial reports),
(
2
) Communicating with the general public,
(
3
) Soliciting sales of its own stock,
(
4
) Accepting the subscriptions of new stockholders,
(
5
) Maintaining its principal corporate records and books of account,
(
6
) Auditing its books of account,
(
7
) Disbursing payments of dividends, legal fees, accounting fees, and officers' and directors' salaries,
(
8
) Publishing or furnishing the offering and redemption price of the shares of stock issued by it,
(
9
) Conducting meetings of its shareholders and board of directors, and
(
10
) Making redemptions of its own stock.
The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(a) Foreign corporation X (not a corporation which is, or but for section 542(c)(7) or 543(b)(1)(C) would be, a personal holding company) was organized to sell its shares to nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations and to invest the proceeds from the sale of such shares in stocks or securities in the United States. Foreign corporation X is engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, and trading in stocks or securities for its own account.
(b) For a period of three years, foreign corporation X irrevocably authorizes domestic corporation Y to exercise its discretion in effecting transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for the account and risk of foreign corporation X. Foreign corporation X issues a prospectus in which it is stated that its funds will be invested pursuant to an investment advisory contract with domestic corporation Y and otherwise advertises its services. Shares of foreign corporation X are sold to nonresident aliens and foreign corporations who are customers of the United States brokerage firms unrelated to domestic corporation Y or foreign corporation X. The principal functions performed for foreign corporation X by domestic corporation Y are the rendering of investment advice and the effecting of transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for the account of foreign corporation X. Moreover, domestic corporation Y occasionally communicates with prospective foreign investors in foreign corporation X (through speaking engagements abroad by management of domestic corporation Y, and otherwise) for the purpose of explaining the investment techniques and policies used by domestic corporation Y in investing the funds of foreign corporation X. However, domestic corporation Y does not participate in the day-to-day conduct of other business activities of foreign corporation X.
(c) Foreign corporation X maintains a general business office or offices outside the United States in which its management is
permanently located and from which it carries on, except to the extent noted heretofore, the functions enumerated in (
b
)(
1
) through (
10
) of this subdivision. The management of foreign corporation X at all times retains the independent power to cancel the investment advisory contract with domestic corporation Y subject to the contractual limitations contained therein and is in all other respects independent of the management of domestic corporation Y. The managing personnel of foreign corporation X communicate on a regular basis with domestic corporation Y, and periodically visit the offices of domestic corporation Y, in connection with the business activities of foreign corporation X.
(d) The principal office of foreign corporation X will not be considered to be in the United States; and, therefore, foreign corporation X is not engaged in trade or business within the United States solely by reason of its relationship with domestic corporation Y.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that, in lieu of having the investment advisory contract with domestic corporation Y, foreign corporation X has an office in the United States in which its employees perform the same functions as are performed by domestic corporation Y in example 1. Foreign corporation X is not engaged in trade or business within the United States during the taxable year solely because the employees located in its United States office effect transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for the account of that corporation.
(iv)
Definition of dealer in stocks or securities
—(
a
)
In general.
For purposes of this subparagraph, a dealer in stocks or securities is a merchant of stocks or securities, with an established place of business, regularly engaged as a merchant in purchasing stocks or securities and selling them to customers with a view to the gains and profits that may be derived therefrom. Persons who buy and sell, or hold, stocks or securities for investment or speculation, irrespective of whether such buying or selling constitutes the carrying on of a trade or business, and officers of corporations, members of partnerships, or fiduciaries, who in their individual capacities buy and sell, or hold, stocks or securities for investment or speculation are not dealers in stocks or securities within the meaning of this subparagraph solely by reason of that activity. In determining under this subdivision whether a person is a dealer in stocks or securities such person's transactions in stocks or securities effected both in and outside the United States shall be taken into account.
(
b
)
Underwriting syndicates and dealers trading for others.
A foreign person who otherwise may be considered a dealer in stocks or securities under (a) of this subdivision shall not be considered a dealer in stocks or securities for purposes of this subparagraph—
(
1
) Solely because he acts as an underwriter, or as a selling group member, for the purpose of making a distribution of stocks or securities of a domestic issuer to foreign purchasers of such stocks or securities, irrespective of whether other members of the selling group distribute the stocks or securities of the domestic issuer to domestic purchasers, or
(
2
) Solely because of transactions effected in the United States in stocks or securities pursuant to his grant of discretionary authority to make decisions in effecting those transactions, if he can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the broker, commission agent, custodian, or other agent through whom the transactions were effected acted pursuant to his written representation that the funds in respect of which such discretion was granted were the funds of a customer who is neither a dealer in stocks or securities, a partnership described in subdivision (ii)(
b
) of this subparagraph, or a foreign corporation described in subdivision (iii)(
b
) of this subparagraph.
For purposes of this (
b
), a foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, or a partnership any member of which is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation. This (
b
) shall apply only if the foreign person at no time during the taxable year has an office or other fixed place of business in the United States through which, or by the direction of which, the transactions in stocks or securities are effected.
(
c
)
Illustrations.
The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Foreign corporation X is a member of an underwriting syndicate organized to distribute stock issued by domestic corporation Y. Foreign corporation X distributes the stock of domestic corporation Y to
foreign purchasers only. Domestic corporation M is syndicate manager of the underwriting syndicate and, pursuant to the terms of the underwriting agreement, reserves the right to sell certain quantities of the underwritten stock on behalf of all the members of the syndicate so as to engage in stabilizing transactions and to take certain other actions which may result in the realization of profit by all members of the underwriting syndicate. Foreign corporation X is not engaged in trade or business within the United States solely by reason of its participation as a member of such underwriting syndicate for the purpose of distributing the stock of domestic corporation Y to foreign purchasers or by reason of the exercise by M corporation of its discretionary authority as manager of such syndicate.

# Example 2.
Foreign corporation Y, a calendar year taxpayer, is a bank which trades in stocks or securities both for its own account and for the account of others. During 1967 foreign corporation Y authorizes domestic corporation M, a broker, to exercise its discretion in effecting transactions in the United States in stocks or securities for the account of B, a nonresident alien individual who has a trading account with foreign corporation Y. Foreign corporation Y furnishes a written representation to domestic corporation M to the effect that the funds in respect of which foreign corporation Y has authorized domestic corporation M to use its discretion in trading in the United States in stocks or securities are not funds in respect of which foreign corporation Y is trading for its own account but are the funds of one of its customers who is neither a dealer in stocks or securities, a partnership described in subdivision (ii)(
b
) of this subparagraph, or a foreign corporation described in subdivision (iii)(
b
) of this subparagraph. Pursuant to the discretionary authority so granted, domestic corporation M effects transactions in the United States during 1967 in stocks or securities for the account of the customer of foreign corporation Y. At no time during 1967 does foreign corporation Y have an office or other fixed place of business in the United States through which, or by the direction of which, such transactions in stocks or securities are effected by domestic corporation M. During 1967 foreign corporation Y is not engaged in trade or business within the United States solely by reason of such trading in stocks or securities during such year by domestic corporation M for the account of the customer of foreign corporation Y. Copies of the written representations furnished to domestic corporation M should be retained by foreign corporation Y for inspection by the Commissioner, if inspection is requested.
(d)
Trading in commodities.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section—
(1)
In general.
The term “engaged in trade or business within the United States” does not include the effecting of transactions in the United States in commodities (including hedging transactions) through a resident broker, commission agent, custodian, or other independent agent if (i) the commodities are of a kind customarily dealt in on an organized commodity exchange, such as a grain futures or a cotton futures market, (ii) the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated at such place, and (iii) the taxpayer at no time during the taxable year has an office or other fixed place of business in the United States through which, or by the direction of which, the transactions in commodities are effected. The volume of commodity transactions effected during the taxable year shall not be taken into account in determining under this subparagraph whether the taxpayer is engaged in trade or business in the United States.
(2)
Trading for taxpayer's own account
—(i)
In general.
The term “engaged in trade or business within the United States” does not include the effecting of transactions in the United States in commodities (including hedging transactions) for the taxpayer's own account if the commodities are of a kind customarily dealt in on an organized commodity exchange and if the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated at such place. This rule shall apply irrespective of whether such transactions are effected by or through—
(
a
) The taxpayer himself while present in the United States,
(
b
) Employees of the taxpayer, whether or not such employees are present in the United States while effecting the transactions, or
(
c
) A broker, commission, agent, custodian, or other agent of the taxpayer, whether or not such agent while effecting the transactions is (
1
) dependent or independent, or (
2
) resident, nonresident, or present, in the United States, and irrespective of whether any such employee or agent has discretionary authority to make decisions in effecting such transactions. The volume of commodity transactions effected during the taxable year shall not be taken into account in determining
under this subparagraph whether the taxpayer is engaged in trade or business within the United States. This subparagraph shall not apply to the effecting of transactions in the United States for the account of a dealer in commodities.
(ii)
Partnerships.
A nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, foreign estate, foreign trust, or foreign corporation shall not be considered to be engaged in trade or business within the United States solely because such person is a member of a partnership (whether domestic or foreign) which, pursuant to discretionary authority granted to such partnership by such person, effects transactions in the United States in commodities for the partnership's account or solely because an employee of such partnership, or a broker, commission agent, custodian, or other agent, pursuant to discretionary authority granted by such partnership, effects transactions in the United States in commodities for the account of such partnership. This subdivision shall not apply to any member of a partnership which is a dealer in commodities.
(iii)
Illustration.
The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Foreign corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged as a merchant in the business of purchasing grain in South America and selling such cash grain outside the United States under long-term contracts for delivery in foreign countries. Foreign corporation X consummates a sale of 100,000 bushels of cash grain in February 1967 for July delivery to Sweden. Because foreign corporation X does not actually own such grain at the time of the sales transaction, such corporation buys as a hedge a July “futures contract” for delivery of 100,000 bushels of grain, in order to protect itself from loss by reason of a possible rise in the price of grain between February and July. The “futures contract” is ordered through domestic corporation Y, a futures commission merchant registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. Foreign corporation X is not engaged in trade or business within the United States during 1967 solely by reason of its effecting of such futures contract for its own account through domestic corporation Y.
(3)
Definition of commodity.
For purposes of section 864(b)(2)(B) and this paragraph the term “commodities” does not include goods or merchandise in the ordinary channels of commerce.
(e)
Other rules.
The fact that a person is not determined by reason of this section to be not engaged in trade or business with the United States is not to be considered a determination that such person is engaged in trade or business within the United States. Whether or not such person is engaged in trade or business within the United States shall be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances in each case. For other rules relating to the determination of whether a taxpayer is engaged in trade or business in the United States see section 875 and the regulations thereunder.
(f)
Effective date.
The provisions of this section shall apply only in the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966.
[T.D. 6948, 33 FR 5090, Mar. 28, 1968, as amended by T.D. 7378, 40 FR 45435, Oct. 2, 1975]
§ 1.864-3
Rules for determining income effectively connected with U.S. business of nonresident aliens or foreign corporations.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, in the case of a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation that is engaged in a trade or business in the United States at any time during the taxable year, the rules set forth in §§ 1.864-4 through 1.864-7 and this section shall apply in determining whether income, gain, or loss shall be treated as effectively connected for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Except as provided in sections 871 (c) and (d) and 882 (d) and (e), and the regulations thereunder, in the case of a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation that is at no time during the taxable year engaged in a trade or business in the United States, no income, gain, or loss shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. The general rule prescribed by the preceding sentence shall apply even though the income, gain, or loss would have been treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States
if such income or gain had been received or accrued, or such loss had been sustained, in an earlier taxable year when the taxpayer was engaged in a trade or business in the United States. In applying §§ 1.864-4 through 1.864-7 and this section, the determination whether an item of income, gain, or loss is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States shall not be controlled by any administrative, judicial, or other interpretation made under the laws of any foreign country.
(b)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
During 1967 foreign corporation N, which uses the calendar year as the taxable year, is engaged in the business of purchasing and selling household equipment on the installment plan. During 1967 N is engaged in business in the United States by reason of the sales activities it carries on in the United States for the purpose of selling therein some of the equipment which it has purchased. During 1967 N receives installment payments of $800,000 on sales it makes that year in the United States, and the income from sources within the United States for 1967 attributable to such payments is $200,000. By reason of section 864(c)(3) and paragraph (b) of § 1.864-4 this income of $200,000 is effectively connected for 1967 with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by N. In December of 1967, N discontinues its efforts to make any further sales of household equipment in the United States, and at no time during 1968 is N engaged in a trade or business in the United States. During 1968 N receives installment payments of $500,000 on the sales it made in the United States during 1967, and the income from sources within the United States for 1968 attributable to such payments is $125,000. By reason of section 864(c)(1)(B) and this section, this income of $125,000 is not effectively connected for 1968 with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by N, even though such amount, if it had been received by N during 1967, would have been effectively connected for 1967 with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation.

# Example 2.
R, a foreign holding company, owns all of the voting stock in five corporations, two of which are domestic corporations. All of the subsidiary corporations are engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. R has an office in the United States where its chief executive officer, who is also the chief executive officer of one of the domestic corporations, spends a substantial portion of the taxable year supervising R's investment in its operating subsidiaries and performing his function as chief executive officer of the domestic operating subsidiary. R is not considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the taxable year by reason of the activities carried on in the United States by its chief executive officer in the supervision of its investment in its operating subsidiary corporations. Accordingly, the dividends from sources within the United States received by R during the taxable year from its domestic subsidiary corporations are not effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by R.

# Example 3.
During the months of June through December 1971, B, a nonresident alien individual who uses the calendar year as the taxable year and the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, is employed in the United States by domestic corporation M for a salary of $2,000 per month, payable semimonthly. During 1971, B receives from M salary payments totaling $13,000, all of which income by reason of section 864(c)(2) and paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of § 1.864-4, is effectively connected for 1971 with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by B. On December 31, 1971, B terminates his employment with M and departs from the United States. At no time during 1972 is B engaged in a trade or business in the United States. In January of 1972, B receives from M salary of $1,000 for the last half of December 1971, and a bonus of $1,000 in consideration of the services B performed in the United States during 1971 for that corporation. By reason of section 864(c)(1)(B) and this section, the $2,000 received by B during 1972 from sources within the United States is not effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, even though such amount, if it had been received by B during 1971, would have been effectively connected for 1971 with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by B.
[T.D. 7216, 37 FR 23424, Nov. 3, 1972]
§ 1.864-4
U.S. source income effectively connected with U.S. business.
(a)
In general.
This section applies only to a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation that is engaged in a trade or business in the United States at some time during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, and to the income, gain, or loss of such person from sources within the United States. If the income, gain, or loss of such person for the taxable year from sources within the United States consists of (1) gain or loss from the sale
or exchange of capital assets or (2) fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income or certain other gains described in section 871(a)(1) or 881(a), certain factors must be taken into account, as prescribed by section 864(c)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section, in order to determine whether the income, gain, or loss is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that person. All other income, gain, or loss of such person for the taxable year from sources within the United States shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that person, as prescribed by section 864(c)(3) and paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Income other than fixed or determinable income and capital gains.
All income, gain, or loss for the taxable year derived by a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation engaged in a trade or business in the United States from sources within the United States which does not consist of income, gain, or loss described in section 871(a)(1) or 881(a), or of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of capital assets, shall, for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. This income, gain, or loss shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, whether or not the income, gain, or loss is derived from the trade or business being carried on in the United States during the taxable year. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
M, a foreign corporation which uses the calendar year as the taxable year, is engaged in the business of manufacturing machine tools in a foreign country. It establishes a branch office in the United States during 1968 which solicits orders from customers in the United States for the machine tools manufactured by that corporation. All negotiations with respect to such sales are carried on in the United States. By reason of its activity in the United States M is engaged in business in the United States during 1968. The income or loss from sources within the United States from such sales during 1968 is treated as effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a business in the United States by M. Occasionally, during 1968 the customers in the United States write directly to the home office of M, and the home office makes sales directly to such customers without routing the transactions through its branch office in the United States. The income or loss from sources within the United States for 1968 from these occasional direct sales by the home office is also treated as effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a business in the United States by M.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that during 1967 M was also engaged in the business of purchasing and selling office machines and that it used the installment method of accounting for the sales made in this separate business. During 1967 M was engaged in business in the United States by reason of the sales activities it carried on in the United States for the purpose of selling therein a number of the office machines which it had purchased. Although M discontinued this business activity in the United States in December of 1967, it received in 1968 some installment payments on the sales which it had made in the United States during 1967. The income of M for 1968 from sources within the United States which is attributable to such installment payments is effectively connected for 1968 with the conduct of a business in the United States, even though such income is not connected with the business carried on in the United States during 1968 through its sales office located in the United States for the solicitation of orders for the machine tools it manufactures.

# Example 3.
Foreign corporation S, which uses the calendar year as the taxable year, is engaged in the business of purchasing and selling electronic equipment. The home office of such corporation is also engaged in the business of purchasing and selling vintage wines. During 1968, S establishes a branch office in the United States to sell electronic equipment to customers, some of whom are located in the United States and the balance, in foreign countries. This branch office is not equipped to sell, and does not participate in sales of, wine purchased by the home office. Negotiations for the sales of the electronic equipment take place in the United States. By reason of the activity of its branch office in the United States, S is engaged in business in the United States during 1968. As a result of advertisements which the home office of S places in periodicals sold in the United States, customers in the United States frequently place orders for the purchase of wines with the home office in the foreign country, and the home office makes sales of wine in 1968 directly to such customers without routing the transactions through its branch office in the United
States. The income or loss from sources within the United States for 1968 from sales of electronic equipment by the branch office, together with the income or loss from sources within the United States for that year from sales of wine by the home office, is treated as effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a business in the United States by S.
(c)
Fixed or determinable income and capital gains
—(1)
Principal factors to be taken into account
—(i)
In general.
In determining for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section whether any income for the taxable year from sources within the United States which is described in section 871(a)(1) or 881(a), relating to fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income and certain other gains, or whether gain or loss from sources within the United States for the taxable year from the sale or exchange of capital assets, is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, the principal tests to be applied are (a) the asset-use test, that is, whether the income, gain, or loss is derived from assets used in, or held for use in, the conduct of the trade or business in the United States, and (b) the business-activities test, that is, whether the activities of the trade or business conducted in the United States were a material factor in the realization of the income, gain, or loss.
(ii)
Special rule relating to interest on certain deposits.
For purposes of determining under section 861(a)(1)(A) (relating to interest on deposits with banks, savings and loan associations, and insurance companies paid or credited before January 1, 1976) whether the interest described therein is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, such interest shall be treated as income from sources within the United States for purposes of applying this paragraph and § 1.864-5. If by reason of the application of this paragraph such interest is determined to be income which is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, it shall then be treated as interest from sources without the United States which is not subject to the application of § 1.864-5.
(2)
Application of the asset-use test
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the asset-use test ordinarily shall apply in making a determination with respect to income, gain, or loss of a passive type where the trade or business activities as such do not give rise directly to the realization of the income, gain, or loss. However, even in the case of such income, gain, or loss, any activities of the trade or business which materially contribute to the realization of such income, gain, or loss shall also be taken into account as a factor in determining whether the income, gain, or loss is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. The asset-use test is of primary significance where, for example, interest income is derived from sources within the United States by a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation that is engaged in the business of manufacturing or selling goods in the United States. See also subparagraph (5) of this paragraph for rules applicable to taxpayers conducting a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States.
(ii)
Cases where applicable.
Ordinarily, an asset shall be treated as used in, or held for use in, the conduct of a trade or business in the United States if the asset is—
(
a
) Held for the principal purpose of promoting the present conduct of the trade or business in the United States; or
(
b
) Acquired and held in the ordinary course of the trade or business conducted in the United States, as, for example, in the case of an account or note receivable arising from that trade or business; or
(
c
) Otherwise held in a direct relationship to the trade or business conducted in the United States, as determined under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
(iii)
Application of asset-use test to stock
—(
a
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(
b
) of this section, stock of a corporation (whether domestic or foreign) shall not be treated as an asset used in, or held for use in, the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
(
b
)
Stock held by foreign insurance companies.
This paragraph (c)(2)(iii) shall not apply to stock of a corporation (whether domestic or foreign) held by a foreign insurance company unless the foreign insurance company owns 10 percent or more of the total voting power or value of all classes of stock of such corporation. For purposes of this section, section 318(a) shall be applied in determining ownership, except that in applying section 318(a)(2)(C), the phrase “10 percent” is used instead of the phrase “50 percent.”
(iv)
Direct relationship between holding of asset and trade or business
—(
a
)
In general.
In determining whether an asset is held in a direct relationship to the trade or business conducted in the United States, principal consideration shall be given to whether the asset is needed in that trade or business. An asset shall be considered needed in a trade or business, for this purpose, only if the asset is held to meet the present needs of that trade or business and not its anticipated future needs. An asset shall be considered as needed in the trade or business conducted in the United States if, for example, the asset is held to meet the operating expenses of that trade or business. Conversely, an asset shall be considered as not needed in the trade or business conducted in the United States if, for example, the asset is held for the purpose of providing for (
1
) future diversification into a new trade or business, (
2
) expansion of trade or business activities conducted outside of the United States, (
3
) future plant replacement, or (
4
) future business contingencies.
(
b
) Presumption of direct relationship. Generally, an asset will be treated as held in a direct relationship to the trade or business if (
1
) the asset was acquired with funds generated by that trade or business, (
2
) the income from the asset is retained or reinvested in that trade or business, and (
3
) personnel who are present in the United States and actively involved in the conduct of that trade or business exercise significant management and control over the investment of such asset.
(v)
Illustration.
The application of paragraph (iv) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
M, a foreign corporation which uses the calendar year as the taxable year, is engaged in industrial manufacturing in a foreign country. M maintains a branch in the United States which acts as importer and distributor of the merchandise it manufactures abroad; by reason of these branch activities. M is engaged in business in the United States during 1968. The branch in the United States is required to hold a large current cash balance for business purposes, but the amount of the cash balance so required varies because of the fluctuating seasonal nature of the branch's business. During 1968 at a time when large cash balances are not required the branch invests the surplus amount in U.S. Treasury bills. Since these Treasury bills are held to meet the present needs of the business conducted in the United States they are held in a direct relationship to that business, and the interest for 1968 on these bills is effectively connected for that year with the conduct of the business in the United States by M.

# Example 2.
Foreign corporation M, which uses the calendar year as the taxable year, has a branch office in the United States where it sells to customers located in the United States various products which are manufactured by that corporation in a foreign country. By reason of this activity M is engaged in business in the United States during 1997. The U.S. branch establishes in 1997 a fund to which are periodically credited various amounts which are derived from the business carried on at such branch. The amounts in this fund are invested in various securities issued by domestic corporations by the managing officers of the U.S. branch, who have the responsibility for maintaining proper investment diversification and investment of the fund. During 1997, the branch office derives from sources within the United States interest on these securities, and gains and losses resulting from the sale or exchange of such securities. Since the securities were acquired with amounts generated by the business conducted in the United States, the interest is retained in that business, and the portfolio is managed by personnel actively involved in the conduct of that business, the securities are presumed under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(
b
) of this section to be held in a direct relationship to that business. However, M is able to rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the fund was established to carry out a program of future expansion and not to meet the present needs of the business conducted in the United States. Consequently, the income, gains, and losses from the securities for 1997 are not effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by M.
(3)
Application of the business-activities test
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the business-activities test shall ordinarily apply in making a determination with respect to income, gain, or loss which, even though generally of the passive type, arises directly from the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business in the United States. The business-activities test is of primary significance, for example, where (
a
) dividends or interest are derived by a dealer in stocks or securities, (
b
) gain or loss is derived from the sale or exchange of capital assets in the active conduct of a trade or business by an investment company, (
c
) royalties are derived in the active conduct of a business consisting of the licensing of patents or similar intangible property, or (
d
) service fees are derived in the active conduct of a servicing business. In applying the business-activities test, activities relating to the management of investment portfolios shall not be treated as activities of the trade or business conducted in the United States unless the maintenance of the investments constitutes the principal activity of that trade or business. See also subparagraph (5) of this paragraph for rules applicable to taxpayers conducting a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States.
(ii)
Illustrations.
The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Foreign corporation S is a foreign investment company organized for the purpose of investing in stocks and securities. S is not a personal holding company or a corporation which would be a personal holding company but for section 542(c)(7) or 543(b)(1)(C). Its investment portfolios consist of common stocks issued by both foreign and domestic corporations and a substantial amount of high grade bonds. The business activity of S consists of the management of its portfolios for the purpose of investing, reinvesting, or trading in stocks and securities. During the taxable year 1968, S has its principal office in the United States within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of § 1.864-2 and, by reason of its trading in the United States in stocks and securities, is engaged in business in the United States. The dividends and interest derived by S during 1968 from sources within the United States, and the gains and losses from sources within the United States for such year from the sale of stocks and securities from its investment portfolios, are effectively connected for 1968 with the conduct of the business in the United States by that corporation, since its activities in connection with the management of its investment portfolios are activities of that business and such activities are a material factor in the realization of such income, gains, and losses.

# Example 2.
N, a foreign corporation which uses the calendar year as the taxable year, has a branch in the United States which acts as an importer and distributor of merchandise; by reason of the activities of that branch, N is engaged in business in the United States during 1968. N also carries on a business in which it licenses patents to unrelated persons in the United States for use in the United States. The businesses of the licensees in which these patents are used have no direct relationship to the business carried on in N's branch in the United States, although the merchandise marketed by the branch is similar in type to that manufactured under the patents. The negotiations and other activities leading up to the consummation of these licenses are conducted by employees of N who are not connected with the U.S. branch of that corporation, and the U.S. branch does not otherwise participate in arranging for the licenses. Royalties received by N during 1968 from these licenses are not effectively connected for that year with the conduct of its business in the United States because the activities of that business are not a material factor in the realization of such income.
(4)
Method of accounting as a factor.
In applying the asset-use test or the business-activities test described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, due regard shall be given to whether or not the asset, or the income, gain, or loss, is accounted for through the trade or business conducted in the United States, that is, whether or not the asset, or the income, gain, or loss, is carried on books of account separately kept for that trade or business, but this accounting test shall not by itself be controlling. In applying this subparagraph, consideration shall be given to whether the accounting treatment of an item reflects the consistent application of generally accepted accounting principles in a particular trade or business in accordance with accepted conditions or practices in that trade or business and whether there is a consistent accounting treatment of that item from year to year by the taxpayer.
(5)
Special rules relating to banking, financing, or similar business activity
—(i)
Definition of banking, financing, or similar business.
A nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation shall be considered for purposes of this section and paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.864-5 to be engaged in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States if at some time during the taxable year the taxpayer is engaged in business in the United States and the activities of such business consist of any one or more of the following activities carried on, in whole or in part, in the United States in transactions with persons situated within or without the United States:
(
a
) Receiving deposits of funds from the public,
(
b
) Making personal, mortgage, industrial, or other loans to the public,
(
c
) Purchasing, selling, discounting, or negotiating for the public on a regular basis, notes, drafts, checks, bills of exchange, acceptances, or other evidences of indebtedness,
(
d
) Issuing letters of credit to the public and negotiating drafts drawn thereunder,
(
e
) Providing trust services for the public, or
(
f
) Financing foreign exchange transactions for the public.
Although the fact that the taxpayer is subjected to the banking and credit laws of a foreign country shall be taken into account in determining whether he is engaged in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business, the character of the business actually carried on during the taxable year in the United States shall determine whether the taxpayer is actively conducting a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States. A foreign corporation which acts merely as a financing vehicle for borrowing funds for its parent corporation or any other person who would be a related person within the meaning of section 954(d)(3) if such foreign corporation were a controlled foreign corporation shall not be considered to be engaged in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States.
(ii)
Effective connection of income from stocks or securities with active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business.
Notwithstanding the rules in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph with respect to the asset-use test and the business-activities test, any dividends or interest from stocks or securities, or any gain or loss from the sale or exchange of stocks or securities which are capital assets, which is from sources within the United States and derived by a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation in the active conduct during the taxable year of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States shall be treated as effectively connected for such year with the conduct of that business only if the stocks or securities giving rise to such income, gain, or loss are attributable to the U.S. office through which such business is carried on and—
(
a
) Were acquired—
(
1
) As a result of, or in the course of making loans to the public,
(
2
) In the course of distributing such stocks or securities to the public, or
(
3
) For the purpose of being used to satisfy the reserve requirements, or other requirements similar to reserve requirements, established by a duly constituted banking authority in the United States, or
(
b
) Consist of securities (as defined in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph) which are—
(
1
) Payable on demand or at a fixed maturity date not exceeding 1 year from the date of acquisition,
(
2
) Issued by the United States, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or
(
3
) Not described in (
a
) or in (
1
) or (
2
) of this (
b
).
However, the amount of interest from securities described in (
b
)(
3
) of this subdivision (ii) which shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States shall be an amount (but not in excess of the entire interest for the taxable year from sources within the United States from such securities) determined by multiplying the entire interest for the taxable year from sources within the United States from such securities by a fraction the numerator of which is 10 percent and the
denominator of which is the same percentage, determined on the basis of a monthly average for the taxable year, as the book value of the total of such securities held by the U.S. office through which such business is carried on bears to the book value of the total assets of such office. The amount of gain or loss, if any, for the taxable year from the sale or exchange of such securities which shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States shall be an amount (but not in excess of the entire gain or loss for the taxable year from sources within the United States from the sale or exchange of such securities) determined by multiplying the entire gain or loss for the taxable year from sources within the United States from the sale or exchange of such securities by the fraction described in the immediately preceding sentence. The percentage of the denominator of the limiting fraction for such purposes shall be the percentage obtained by separately adding the book value of such securities and such total assets held at the close of each month in the taxable year, dividing each such sum by 12, and then dividing the amount of securities so obtained by the amount of assets so obtained. This subdivision does not apply to dividends from stock owned by a foreign corporation in a domestic corporation of which more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote is owned by such foreign corporation and which is engaged in the active conduct of a banking business in the United States. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Foreign corporation M, created under the laws of foreign country Y, has in the United States a branch, B, which during the taxable year is engaged in the active conduct of the banking business in the United States within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. During the taxable year M derives from sources within the United States through the activities carried on through B, $7,500,000 interest from securities described in subdivision (
b
)(
3
) of this subdivision (ii) and $7,500,000 gain from the sale or exchange of such securities. The monthly average, determined as of the last day of each month in the taxable year, of such securities held by B divided by the monthly average, as so determined, of the total assets held by B equals 15 percent. Under this subdivision, the amount of interest income from such securities that shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the active conduct by M of a banking business in the United States is $5 million ($7,500,000 interest × 10% / 15%), and the amount of gain from the sale or exchange of such securities that shall be treated as effectively connected for such year with the active conduct of such business is $5 million ($7,500,000 gain × 10% / 15%).
(iii)
Stocks or securities attributable to U.S. office
—(
a
)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, a stock or security shall be deemed to be attributable to a U.S. office only if such office actively and materially participated in soliciting, negotiating, or performing other activities required to arrange the acquisition of the stock or security. The U.S. office need not have been the only active participant in arranging the acquisition of the stock or security.
(
b
)
Exceptions.
A stock or security shall not be deemed to be attributable to a U.S. office merely because such office conducts one or more of the following activities:
(
1
) Collects or accounts for the dividends, interest, gain, or loss from such stock or security,
(
2
) Exercises general supervision over the activities of the persons directly responsible for carrying on the activities described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(
a
) of this section,
(
3
) Performs merely clerical functions incident to the acquisition of such stock or security,
(
4
) Exercises final approval over the execution of the acquisition of such stock or security, or
(
5
) Holds such stock or security in the United States or records such stock or security on its books or records as having been acquired by such office or for its account.
(
c
)
Effective date.
This paragraph (c)(5)(iii) shall be effective for income includible in taxable years beginning on or after June 18, 1984, except that 26 CFR 1.864-4 (c)(5)(iii) as it appeared in the Code of Federal Regulations revised as of April 1, 1983, shall apply to income received or accrued under a
loan made by the taxpayer on or before May 18, 1984, or pursuant to a written binding commitment entered into on or before May 18, 1984.
(iv)
Acquisitions in course of making loans to the public.
For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph—
(
a
) A stock or security shall be considered to have been acquired in the course of making a loan to the public where, for example, such stock or security was acquired as additional consideration for the making of the loan,
(
b
) A stock or security shall be considered to have been acquired as a result of making a loan to the public if, for example, such stock or security was acquired by foreclosure upon a bona fide default of the loan and is held as an ordinary and necessary incident to the active conduct of the banking, financing, or similar business in the United States, and
(
c
) A stock or security acquired on a stock exchange or organized over-the-counter market shall be considered not to have been acquired as a result of, or in the course of, making loans to the public.
(v)
Security defined.
For purposes of this subparagraph, a security is any bill, note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness, or any evidence of an interest in, or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing items.
(vi)
Limitations on application of subparagraph—(a) Other business activity.
This subparagraph provides rules for determining when certain income from stocks or securities is effectively connected with the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States. Any dividends, interest, gain, or loss from sources within the United States which by reason of the application of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is not effectively connected with the active conduct by a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States may be effectively connected for the taxable year, under subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph with the conduct by such taxpayer of another trade or business in the United States, such as, for example, the business of selling or manufacturing goods or merchandise or of trading in stocks or securities for the taxpayer's own account.
(
b
)
Other income.
For rules relating to income, gain, or loss from sources within the United States (other than dividends or interest from, or gain or loss from the sale or exchange of, stocks or securities referred to in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) derived in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States, see subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph and paragraph (b) of this section.
(vii)
Illustrations.
The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Foreign corporation F, which is created under the laws of foreign country X and engaged in the active conduct of the banking business in country X and a number of other foreign countries, has in the United States a branch, B, which during the taxable year is engaged in the active conduct of the banking business in the United States within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. In the course of its banking business in foreign countries, F receives at its branches located in country X and other foreign countries substantial deposits in U.S. dollars which are transferred to the accounts of B in the United States. During the taxable year, B actively participates in negotiating loans to residents of the United States, such as call loans to U.S. brokers, which are financed from the U.S. dollar deposits transferred to B by F. In addition, B actively participates in purchasing on the New York Stock Exchange and over-the-counter markets long-term bonds and notes issued by the U.S. Government, U.S. Treasury bills, and long-term interest-bearing bonds issued by domestic corporations and having a maturity date of less than 1 year from the date of acquisition, all of which are purchased from the deposits transferred to B by F. All of the securities so acquired are held by B and recorded on its books in the United States. Pursuant to subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the interest received by F during the taxable year on these loans, bonds, notes, and bills is effectively connected for such year with the active conduct by F of a banking business in the United States.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that B also actively participates in using part of the U.S. dollar deposits, which are transferred to it by F, to purchase on the New York Stock Exchange shares of common stock issued by various domestic corporations. All of the shares so purchased are considered to be capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 and are
recorded on B's books in the United States. None of the shares so purchased were acquired for the purpose of meeting reserve or other similar requirements. During the taxable year some of the shares are sold by B on the stock exchange. Pursuant to subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the dividends and gains received by F during the taxable year on these shares of stock are not effectively connected with the active conduct by F of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that B also uses part of the U.S. dollar deposits, which are transferred to it by F, to make a loan to domestic corporation M. As part of the consideration for the loan, M gives to B a number of shares of common stock issued by M. All of these shares of stock are considered to be capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 and are recorded on B's books in the United States. During the taxable year one-half of these shares of stock is sold by B on the New York Stock Exchange. Pursuant to subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the dividends and gains received by F during the taxable year on these shares of stock are effectively connected for such year with the active conduct by F of a banking business in the United States.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that during the taxable year the home office of F in country X actively participates in negotiating loans to residents of the United States, such as call loans to U.S. brokers, which are financed by the U.S. dollar deposits received at the home office and are recorded on the books of the home office. B does not participate in negotiating these loans. Pursuant to subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph the interest received by F during the taxable year on these loans made by the home office in country X is not effectively connected with the active conduct by F of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States.

# Example 5.
Foreign corporation
Y,
which is created under the laws of foreign country X and is engaged in the active conduct of a banking business in country X and other foreign countries, has a branch,
C,
in the United States that is engaged in the active conduct of a banking business in the United States, within the meaning of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, during the taxable year.
C
handles the negotiation and acquisition of securities involved in loans made by
Y
to U.S. persons.
C
also presents interest coupons with respect to such securities for payment, presents all such securities for payment at maturity, and maintains compete photocopy files with respect to such securities. The activities of the office of
Y
in country X with respect to these securities consist of giving pro forma approval of the loans, storing the original securities, and recording the securities on the books of the country X office. Pursuant to paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) and (c)(5)(iii) of this section, the U.S. source interest income received by
Y
during the taxable year on these securities is effectively connected for such year with the active conduct by
Y
of a banking business in the United States.
(6)
Income related to personal services of an individual
—(i)
Income, gain, or loss from assets.
Income or gains from sources within the United States described in section 871(a)(1) and derived from an asset, and gain or loss from sources within the United States from the sale or exchange of capital assets, realized by a nonresident alien individual engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the taxable year solely by reason of his performing personal services in the United States shall not be treated as income, gain, or loss which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, unless there is a direct economic relationship between his holding of the asset from which the income, gain, or loss results and his trade or business of performing the personal services.
(ii)
Wages, salaries, and pensions.
Wages, salaries, fees, compensations, emoluments, or other remunerations, including bonuses, received by a nonresident alien individual for performing personal services in the United States which, under paragraph (a) of § 1.864-2, constitute engaging in a trade or business in the United States, and pensions and retirement pay attributable to such personal services, constitute income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that individual if he is engaged in a trade or business in the United States at some time during the taxable year in which such income is received.
(7)
Effective date.
Paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(6)(i) of this section are effective for taxable years beginning on or after June 6, 1996.
[T.D. 7216, 37 FR 23425, Nov. 3, 1972, as amended by T.D. 7332, 39 FR 44232, Dec. 23, 1974; T.D. 79-58, 49 FR 21052, May 18, 1984; T.D. 8657, 61 FR 9337, Mar. 8, 1996; T.D. 9226, 70 FR 57510, Oct. 3, 2005]
§ 1.864-5
Foreign source income effectively connected with U.S. business.
(a)
In general.
This section applies only to a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation that is engaged in a trade or business in the United States at some time during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, and to the income, gain, or loss of such person from sources without the United States. The income, gain, or loss of such person for the taxable year from sources without the United States which is specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, only if he also has in the United States at some time during the taxable year, but not necessarily at the time the income, gain, or loss is realized, an office or other fixed place of business, as defined in § 1.864-7, to which such income, gain, or loss is attributable in accordance with § 1.864-6. The income of such person for the taxable year from sources without the United States which is specified in paragraph (c) of this section shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States when derived by a foreign corporation carrying on a life insurance business in the United States. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, no income, gain, or loss of a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation for the taxable year from sources without the United States shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that person. Any income, gain, or loss described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section which, if it were derived by the taxpayer from sources within the United States for the taxable year, would not be treated under § 1.864-4 as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States shall not be treated under this section as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. To determine the source of income, gain or loss from the sale of personal property (including inventory property) attributable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States by nonresidents, as defined in section 865(g)(1)(B), see § 1.865-3.
(b)
Income other than income attributable to U.S. life insurance business.
Income, gain, or loss from sources without the United States other than income described in paragraph (c) of this section or income from section 865(e)(2) sales, as defined in § 1.865-3(c), shall be taken into account pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section in applying §§ 1.864-6 and 1.864-7 only if it consists of—
(1)
Rents, royalties, or gains on sales of intangible property.
(i) Rents or royalties for the use of, or for the privilege of using, intangible personal property located outside the United States or from any interest in such property, including rents or royalties for the use, or for the privilege of using, outside the United States, patents, copyrights, secret processes and formulas, good will, trademarks, trade brands, franchises, and other like properties, if such rents or royalties are derived in the active conduct of the trade or business in the United States.
(ii) Gains or losses on the sale or exchange of intangible personal property located outside the United States or from any interest in such property, including gains or losses on the sale or exchange of the privilege of using, outside the United States, patents, copyrights, secret processes and formulas, good will, trademarks, trade brands, franchises, and other like properties, if such gains or losses are derived in the active conduct of the trade or business in the United States.
(iii) Whether or not such an item of income, gain, or loss is derived in the active conduct of a trade or business in the United States shall be determined from the facts and circumstances of each case. The frequency with which a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation enters into transactions of the type from which the income, gain, or loss is derived shall not of itself determine that the income, gain, or loss is derived in the active conduct of a trade or business.
(iv) This subparagraph shall not apply to rents or royalties for the use of, or for the privilege of using, real
property or tangible personal property, or to gain or loss from the sale or exchange of such property.
(2)
Dividends or interest, or gains or loss from sales of stocks or securities
—(i)
In general.
Dividends or interests from any transaction, or gains or losses on the sale or exchange of stocks or securities, realized by (
a
) a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States or (
b
) a foreign corporation engaged in business in the United States whose principal business is trading in stocks or securities for its own account. Whether the taxpayer is engaged in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States for purposes of this subparagraph shall be determined in accordance with the principles of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of § 1.864-4.
(ii)
Substitute payments.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)92), a substitute interest payment (as defined in § 1.861-2(a)(7)) received by a foreign person subject to tax under this paragraph (b) pursuant to a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction (as defined in § 1.861-2(a)(7)) with respect to a security (as defined in § 1.864-6(b)(2)(ii)(c)) shall have the same character as interest income paid or accrued with respect to the terms of the transferred security. Similarly, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), a substitute dividend payment (as defined in § 1.861-3(a)(6)) received by a foreign person pursuant to a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction (as defined in § 1.861-3(a)(6)) with respect to a stock shall have the same character as a distribution with respect to the transferred security. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii) is applicable to payments made after November 13, 1997.
(iii)
Incidental investment activity.
This subparagraph shall not apply to income, gain, or loss realized by a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation on stocks or securities held, sold, or exchanged in connection with incidental investment activities carried on by that person. Thus, a foreign corporation which is primarily a holding company owning significant percentages of the stocks or securities issued by other corporations shall not be treated under this subparagraph as a corporation the principal business of which is trading in stocks or securities for its own account, solely because it engages in sporadic purchases or sales of stocks or securities to adjust its portfolio. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
F, a foreign corporation, owns voting stock in foreign corporations M, N, and P, its holdings in such corporations constituting 15, 20, and 100 percent, respectively, of all classes of their outstanding voting stock. Each of such stock holdings by F represents approximately 20 percent of its total assets. The remaining 40 percent of F's assets consist of other investments, 20 percent being invested in securities issued by foreign governments and in stocks and bonds issued by other corporations in which F does not own a significant percentage of their outstanding voting stock, and 20 percent being invested in bonds issued by N. None of the assets of F are held primarily for sale; but if the officers of that corporation were to decide that other investments would be preferable to its holding of such assets, F would sell the stocks and securities and reinvest the proceeds therefrom in other holdings. Any income, gain, or loss which F may derive from this investment activity is not considered to be realized by a foreign corporation described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(3)
Sale of goods or merchandise through U.S. office.
(i) Income, gain, or loss from the sale of inventory items or of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, as described in section 1221(1), where the sale is outside the United States but through the office or other fixed place of business which the nonresident alien or foreign corporation has in the United States, irrespective of the destination to which such property is sent for use, consumption, or disposition.
(ii) This subparagraph shall not apply to income, gain, or loss resulting from a sales contract entered into on or before February 24, 1966. See section 102(e)(1) of the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 1547). Thus, for example, the sales office in the United States of a foreign corporation enters into negotiations for the sale of 500,000 industrial bearings which the corporation produces in a foreign country for
consumption in the Western Hemisphere. These negotiations culminate in a binding agreement entered into on January 1, 1966. By its terms delivery under the contract is to be made over a period of 3 years beginning in March of 1966. Payment is due upon delivery. The income from sources without the United States resulting from this sale negotiated by the U.S. sales office of the foreign corporation shall not be taken into account under this subparagraph for any taxable year.
(iii) This subparagraph shall not apply to gains or losses on the sale or exchange of intangible personal property to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies or of stocks or securities to which subparagraph (2) of this paragraph applies.
(c)
Income attributable to U.S. life insurance business.
(1) All of the income for the taxable year of a foreign corporation described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph from sources without the United States, which is attributable to its U.S. life insurance business, shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation. Thus, in determining its life insurance company taxable income from its U.S. business for purposes of section 802, the foreign corporation shall include all of its items of income from sources without the United States which would appropriately be taken into account in determining the life insurance company taxable income of a domestic corporation. The income to which this subparagraph applies shall be taken into account for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section without reference to §§ 1.864-6 and 1.864-7.
(2) A foreign corporation to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies is a foreign corporation carrying on an insurance business in the United States during the taxable year which—
(i) Without taking into account its income not effectively connected for that year with the conduct of any trade or business in the United States, would qualify as a life insurance company under part I (section 801 and following) of subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, if it were a domestic corporation, and
(ii) By reason of section 842 is taxable under that part on its income which is effectively connected for that year with its conduct of any trade or business in the United States.
(d)
Excluded foreign source income.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, no income from sources without the United States shall be treated as effectively connected for any taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation if the income consists of—
(1)
Dividends, interest, or royalties paid by a related foreign corporation.
Dividends, interest, or royalties paid by a foreign corporation in which the nonresident alien individual or the foreign corporation described in paragraph (a) of this section owns, within the meaning of section 958(a), or is considered as owning, by applying the ownership rules of section 958(b), at the time such items are paid more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote.
(2)
Subpart F income of a controlled foreign corporation.
Any income of the foreign corporation described in paragraph (a) of this section which is subpart F income for the taxable year, as determined under section 952(a), even though part of the income is attributable to amounts which, if distributed by the foreign corporation, would be distributed with respect to its stock which is owned by shareholders who are not U.S. shareholders within the meaning of section 951(b). This subparagraph shall not apply to any income of the foreign corporation which is excluded in determining its subpart F income for the taxable year for purposes of section 952(a). Thus, for example, this subparagraph shall not apply to—
(i) Foreign base company shipping income which is excluded under section 954(b)(2),
(ii) Foreign base company income amounting to less than 10 percent (30 percent in the case of taxable years of foreign corporations ending before January 1, 1976) of gross income which by reason of section 954(b)(3)(A) does not become subpart F income for the taxable year,
(iii) Any income excluded from foreign base company income under section 954(b)(4), relating to exception for foreign corporations not availed of to reduce taxes,
(iv) Any income derived in the active conduct of a trade or business which is excluded under section 954(c)(3), or
(v) Any income received from related persons which is excluded under section 954(c)(4).
This subparagraph shall apply to the foreign corporation's entire subpart F income for the taxable year determined under section 952(a), even though no amount is included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder under section 951(a) with respect to that subpart F income because of the minimum distribution provisions of section 963(a) or because of the reduction under section 970(a) with respect to an export trade corporation. This subparagraph shall apply only to a foreign corporation which is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957 and the regulations thereunder. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Controlled foreign corporation M, incorporated under the laws of foreign country X, is engaged in the business of purchasing and selling merchandise manufactured in foreign country Y by an unrelated person. M negotiates sales, through its sales office in the United States, of its merchandise for use outside of country X. These sales are made outside the United States, and the merchandise is sold for use outside the United States. No office maintained by M outside the United States participates materially in the sales made through its U.S. sales office. These activities constitute the only activities of M. During the taxable year M derives $100,000 income from these sales made through its U.S. sales office, and all of such income is foreign base company sales income by reason of section 954(d)(2) and paragraph (b) of § 1.954-3. The entire $100,000 is also subpart F income, determined under section 952(a). In addition, all of this income would, without reference to section 864(c)(4)(D)(ii) and this subparagraph, be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by M. Through its entire taxable year 60 percent of the one class of stock of M is owned within the meaning of section 958(a) by U.S. shareholders, as defined in section 951(b), and 40 percent of its one class of stock is owned within the meaning of section 958(a) by persons who are not U.S. shareholders, as defined in section 951(b). Although only $60,000 of the subpart F income of M for the taxable year is includible in the income of the U.S. shareholders under section 951(a), the entire subpart F income of $100,000 constitutes income which, by reason of section 864(c)(4)(D)(ii) and this subparagraph, is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by M.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that the foreign base company sales income amounts to $150,000 determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(i) of § 1.954-1, and that M also has gross income from sources without the United States of $50,000 from sales, through its sales office in the United States, of merchandise for use in country X. These sales are made outside the United States. All of this income would, without reference to section 864(c)(4)(D)(ii) and this subparagraph, be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by M. Since the foreign base company income of $150,000 amounts to 75 percent of the entire gross income of $200,000, determined as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of § 1.954-1, the entire $200,000 constitutes foreign base company income under section 954(b)(3)(B). Assuming that M has no amounts to be taken into account under paragraphs (1), (2), (4), and (5) of section 954(b), the $200,000 is also subpart F income, determined under section 952(a). This subpart F income of $200,000 constitutes income which, by reason of section 864(c)(4)(D)(ii) and this subparagraph, is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by M.
(3)
Interest on certain deposits.
Interest which, by reason of section 861(a)(1)(A) (relating to interest on deposits with banks, savings and loan associations, and insurance companies paid or credited before January 1, 1976) and paragraph (c) of § 1.864-4, is determined to be income from sources without the United States because it is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation.
(e)
Applicability dates.
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to taxable years ending on or after December 23, 2019. However, a taxpayer may apply paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section in
their entirety for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending before December 23, 2019, provided that the taxpayer and all persons related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) apply paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and §§ 1.863-1(b), 1.863-2(b), 1.863-3, 1.863-8(b)(3)(ii), 1.864-6(c)(2), and 1.865-3 in their entirety for the taxable year, and once applied, the taxpayer and all persons related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) continue to apply these regulations in their entirety for all subsequent taxable years. For regulations generally applicable to taxable years ending before December 23, 2019, see § 1.864-5 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2020.

§ 1.864-6
Income, gain, or loss attributable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States.
(a)
In general.
Income, gain, or loss from sources without the United States which is specified in paragraph (b) of § 1.864-5 and received by a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation engaged in a trade or business in the United States at some time during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States only if the income, gain, or loss is attributable under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to an office or other fixed place of business, as defined in § 1.864-7, which the taxpayer has in the United States at some time during the taxable year.
(b)
Material factor test
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, income, gain, or loss is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business which a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation has in the United States only if such office or other fixed place of business is a material factor in the realization of the income, gain, or loss, and if the income, gain, or loss is realized in the ordinary course of the trade or business carried on through that office or other fixed place of business. For this purpose, the activities of the office or other fixed place of business shall not be considered to be a material factor in the realization of the income, gain, or loss unless they provide a significant contribution to, by being an essential economic element in, the realization of the income, gain, or loss. Thus, for example, meetings in the United States of the board of directors of a foreign corporation do not of themselves constitute a material factor in the realization of income, gain, or loss. It is not necessary that the activities of the office or other fixed place of business in the United States be a major factor in the realization of the income, gain, or loss. An office or other fixed place of business located in the United States at some time during a taxable year may be a material factor in the realization of an item of income, gain, or loss for that year even though the office or other fixed place of business is not present in the United States when the income, gain, or loss is realized.
(2)
Application of material factor test to specific classes of income.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an office or other fixed place of business which a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, engaged in a trade or business in the United States at some time during the taxable year, had in the United States, shall be considered a material factor in the realization of income, gain, or loss consisting of—
(i)
Rents, royalties, or gains on sales of intangible property.
Rents, royalties, or gains or losses, from intangible personal property specified in paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.864-5, if the office or other fixed place of business either actively participates in soliciting, negotiating, or performing other activities required to arrange, the lease, license, sale, or exchange from which such income, gain, or loss is derived or performs significant services incident to such lease, license, sale, or exchange. An office or other fixed place of business in the United States shall not be considered to be a material factor in the realization of income, gain, or loss for purposes of this subdivision merely because the office or other fixed place of
business conducts one or more of the following activities: (
a
) Develops, creates, produces, or acquires and adds substantial value to, the property which is leased, licensed, or sold, or exchanged, (
b
) collects or accounts for the rents, royalties, gains, or losses, (
c
) exercises general supervision over the activities of the persons directly responsible for carrying on the activities or services described in the immediately preceding sentence, (
d
) performs merely clerical functions incident to the lease, license, sale, or exchange or (
e
) exercises final approval over the execution of the lease, license, sale, or exchange. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
F, a foreign corporation, is engaged in the active conduct of the business of licensing patents which it has either purchased or developed in the United States. F has a business office in the United States. Licenses for the use of such patents outside the United States are negotiated by offices of F located outside the United States, subject to approval by an officer of such corporation located in the U.S. office. All services which are rendered to F's foreign licensees are performed by employees of F's offices located outside the United States. None of the income, gain, or loss resulting from the foreign licenses so negotiated by F is attributable to its business office in the United States.

# Example 2.
N, a foreign corporation, is engaged in the active conduct of the business of distributing motion picture films and television programs. N does not distribute such films or programs in the United States. The foreign distribution rights to these films and programs are acquired by N's U.S. business office from the U.S. owners of these films and programs. Employees of N's offices located in various foreign countries carry on in such countries all the solicitations and negotiations for the licensing of these films and programs to licensees located in such countries and provide the necessary incidental services to the licensees. N's U.S. office collects the rentals from the foreign licensees and maintains the necessary records of income and expense. Officers of N located in the United States also maintain general supervision over the employees of the foreign offices, but the foreign employees conduct the day to day business of N outside the United States of soliciting, negotiating, or performing other activities required to arrange the foreign licenses. None of the income, gain, or loss resulting from the foreign licenses so negotiated by N is attributable to N's U.S. office.
(ii)
Dividends or interest, or gains or losses from sales of stock or securities—(a) In general.
Dividends or interest from any transaction, or gains or losses on the sale or exchange of stocks or securities, specified in paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.864-5, if the office or other fixed place of business either actively participates in soliciting, negotiating, or performing other activities required to arrange, the issue, acquisition, sale, or exchange, of the asset from which such income, gain, or loss is derived or performs significant services incident to such issue, acquisition, sale, or exchange. An office or other fixed place of business in the United States shall not be considered to be a material factor in the realization of income, gain, or loss for purposes of this subdivision merely because the office or other fixed place of business conducts one or more of the following activities: (
1
) Collects or accounts for the dividends, interest, gains, or losses, (
2
) exercises general supervision over the activities of the persons directly responsible for carrying on the activities or services described in the immediately preceding sentence, (
3
) performs merely clerical functions incident to the issue, acquisition, sale, or exchange, or (
4
) exercises final approval over the execution of the issue, acquisition, sale, or exchange.
(
b
)
Effective connection of income from stocks or securities with active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business.
Notwithstanding (
a
) of this subdivision (ii), the determination as to whether any dividends or interest from stocks or securities, or gain or loss from the sale or exchange of stocks or securities which are capital assets, which is from sources without the United States and derived by a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation in the active conduct during the taxable year of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States, shall be treated as effectively connected for such year with the active conduct of that business shall be made by applying the principles of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of § 1.864-4 for determining whether income, gain, or loss of such type from sources within the United States is effectively connected for such year with the active conduct of that business.
(
c
)
Security defined.
For purposes of this subdivision (ii), a security is any bill, note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness, or any evidence of an interest in, or right to subscribe or to purchase, any of the foregoing items.
(
d
)
Limitations on application of rules on banking, financing, or similar business
—(
1
)
Trading for taxpayer's own account.
The provisions of (
b
) of this subdivision (ii) apply for purposes of determining when certain income, gain, or loss from stocks or securities is effectively connected with the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States. Any dividends, interest, gain, or loss from sources without the United States which by reason of the application of (
b
) of this subdivision (ii) is not effectively connected with the active conduct by a foreign corporation of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States may be effectively connected for the taxable year, under (
a
) of this subdivision (ii), with the conduct by such taxpayer of a trade or business in the United States which consists of trading in stocks or securities for the taxpayer's own account.
(
2
)
Other income.
For rules relating to dividends or interest from sources without the United States (other than dividends or interest from, or gain or loss from the sale or exchange of, stocks or securities referred to in (
b
) of this subdivision (ii)) derived in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United States, see (
a
) of this subdivision (ii).
(iii)
Sale of goods or merchandise through U.S. office.
Income, gain, or loss from sales of goods or merchandise specified in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.864-5, if the office or other fixed place of business actively participates in soliciting the order, negotiating the contract of sale, or performing other significant services necessary for the consummation of the sale which are not the subject of a separate agreement between the seller and the buyer. The office or other fixed place of business in the United States shall be considered a material factor in the realization of income, gain, or loss from a sale made as a result of a sales order received in such office or other fixed place of business except where the sales order is received unsolicited and that office or other fixed place of business is not held out to potential customers as the place to which such sales orders should be sent. The income, gain, or loss must be realized in the ordinary course of the trade or business carried on through the office or other fixed place of business in the United States. Thus, if a foreign corporation is engaged solely in a manufacturing business in the United States, the income derived by its office in the United States as a result of an occasional sale outside the United States is not attributable to the U.S. office if the sales office of the manufacturing business is located outside the United States. On the other hand, if a foreign corporation establishes a sales office in the United States to sell for consumption in the Western Hemisphere merchandise which the corporation produces in Africa, the income derived by the sales office in the United States as a result of an occasional sale made by it in Europe shall be attributable to the U.S. sales office. An office or other fixed place of business in the United States shall not be considered to be a material factor in the realization of income, gain, or loss for purposes of this subdivision merely because of one or more of the following activities: (
a
) The sale is made subject to the final approval of such office or other fixed place of business, (
b
) the property sold is held in, and distributed from, such office or other fixed place of business, (
c
) samples of the property sold are displayed (but not otherwise promoted or sold) in such office or other fixed place of business, or (
d
) such office or other fixed place of business performs merely clerical functions incident to the sale. Activities carried on by employees of an office or other fixed place of business constitute activities of that office or other fixed place of business.
(3)
Limitation where foreign office is a material factor in realization of income
—(i)
Goods or merchandise destined for foreign use, consumption, or disposition.
Notwithstanding subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, an office or other fixed place of business which a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation has in the United States
shall not be considered, for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, to be a material factor in the realization of income, gain, or loss from sales of goods or merchandise specified in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.864-5 if the property is sold for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States and an office or other fixed place of business, as defined in § 1.864-7, which such nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation has outside the United States participates materially in the sale. For this purpose an office or other fixed place of business which the taxpayer has outside the United States shall be considered to have participated materially in a sale made through the office or other fixed place of business in the United States if the office or other fixed place of business outside the United States actively participates in soliciting the order resulting in the sale, negotiating the contract of sale, or performing other significant services necessary for the consummation of the sale which are not the subject of a separate agreement between the seller and buyer. An office or other fixed place of business which the taxpayer has outside the United States shall not be considered to have participated materially in a sale merely because of one or more of the following activities: (
a
) The sale is made subject to the final approval of such office or other fixed place of business, (
b
) the property sold is held in, and distributed from, such office or other fixed place of business, (
c
) samples of the property sold are displayed (but not otherwise promoted or sold) in such office or other fixed place of business, (
d
) such office or other fixed place of business is used for purposes of having title to the property pass outside the United States, or (
e
) such office or other fixed place of business performs merely clerical functions incident to the sale.
(ii)
Rules for determining country of use, consumption, or disposition—(a) In general.
As a general rule, personal property which is sold to an unrelated person shall be presumed for purposes of this subparagraph to have been sold for use, consumption, or disposition in the country of destination of the property sold; for such purpose, the occurrence in a country of a temporary interruption in shipment of property shall not cause that country to be considered the country of destination. However, if at the time of a sale of personal property to an unrelated person the taxpayer knew, or should have known from the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, that the property probably would not be used, consumed, or disposed of in the country of destination, the taxpayer must determine the country of ultimate use, consumption, or disposition of the property or the property shall be presumed to have been sold for use, consumption, or disposition in the United States. A taxpayer who sells personal property to a related person shall be presumed to have sold the property for use, consumption, or disposition in the United States unless the taxpayer establishes the use made of the property by the related person; once he has established that the related person has disposed of the property, the rules in the two immediately preceding sentences relating to sales to an unrelated person shall apply at the first stage in the chain of distribution at which a sale is made by a related person to an unrelated person. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subdivision (
a
), a taxpayer who sells personal property to any person whose principal business consists of selling from inventory to retail customers at retail outlets outside the United States may assume at the time of the sale to that person that the property will be used, consumed, or disposed of outside the United States. For purposes of this (
a
), a person is related to another person if either person owns or controls directly or indirectly the other, or if any third person or persons own or control directly or indirectly both. For this purpose, the term “control” includes any kind of control, whether or not legally enforceable, and however, exercised or exercisable. For illustrations of the principles of this subdivision, see paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of § 1.954-3.
(
b
)
Fungible goods.
For purposes of this subparagraph, a taxpayer who sells to a purchaser personal property which because of its fungible nature cannot reasonably be specifically traced to other purchasers and to the countries
of ultimate use, consumption, or disposition shall, unless the taxpayer establishes a different disposition as being proper, treat that property as being sold, for ultimate use, consumption, or disposition in those countries, and to those other purchasers, in the same proportions in which property from the fungible mass of the first purchaser is sold in the ordinary course of business by such first purchaser. No apportionment is required to be made, however, on the basis of sporadic sales by the first purchaser. This (
b
) shall apply only in a case where the taxpayer knew, or should have known from the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, the manner in which the first purchaser disposes of property from the fungible mass.
(iii)
Illustration.
The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Foreign corporation M has a sales office in the United States during the taxable year through which it sells outside the United States for use in foreign countries industrial electrical generators which such corporation manufactures in a foreign country. M is not a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957 and the regulations thereunder, and, by reason of its activities in the United States, is engaged in business in the United States during the taxable year. The generators require specialized installation and continuous adjustment and maintenance services. M has an office in foreign country X which is the only organization qualified to perform these installation, adjustment, and maintenance services. During the taxable year M sells several generators through its U.S. office for use in foreign country Y under sales contracts which also provide for installation, adjustment, and maintenance by its office in country X. The generators are installed in country Y by employees of M's office in country X, who also are responsible for the servicing of the equipment. Since the office of M in country X performs significant services incident to these sales which are necessary for their consummation and are not the subject of a separate agreement between M and the purchaser, the U.S. office of M is not considered to be a material factor in the realization of the income from the sales and, for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, such income is not attributable to the U.S. office of that corporation.
(c)
Amount of income, gain, or loss allocable to U.S. office
—(1)
In general.
If, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, an office or other fixed place of business which a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation has in the United States at some time during the taxable year is a material factor in the realization for that year of an item of income, gain, or loss specified in paragraph (b) of § 1.864-5, such item of income, gain, or loss shall be considered to be allocable in its entirety to that office or other fixed place of business. In no case may any income, gain, or loss for the taxable year from sources without the United States, or part thereof, be allocable under this paragraph to an office or other fixed place of business which a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation has in the United States if the taxpayer is at no time during the taxable year engaged in a trade or business in the United States.
(2)
Special limitation in case of sales of goods or merchandise through U.S. office.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the special rules described in this paragraph (c)(2) apply with respect to a sale of goods or merchandise specified in § 1.864-5(b)(3), to which paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section does not apply. In the case of a nonresident alien with a tax home within the United States, as defined in section 911(d)(3), the amount of income from the sale of goods or merchandise that is properly allocable to the individual's U.S. office is determined under § 1.865-3(d).
(3)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples—
(i)
Example 1. Sales of produced inventory through a U.S. sales office.
Individual A, who is a nonresident alien within the meaning of section 7701(b)(1)(B) and has a tax home in the United States, manufactures machinery in a foreign country and sells the machinery outside the United States through A's sales office in the United States for use in foreign countries. A is not a nonresident within the meaning of section 865(g)(1)(B). Therefore, § 1.865-3 does not apply to A's sale of the machinery, except to the extent provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Title to the property sold is transferred to the foreign purchaser outside the United States, but no office
or other fixed place of business of A in a foreign country materially participates in the sale made through A's U.S. office. By reason of its sales activities in the United States, A is engaged in business in the United States during the taxable year. During the taxable year, A derives a total income of $250,000x from these sales. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount of income that is allocable to A's U.S. office is determined under § 1.865-3(d)(2). The taxpayer does not allocate income from the sale under the books and records method described in § 1.865-3(d)(2)(ii). Thus, 50 percent of A's foreign source income of $250,000x, plus any additional income allocable based on the location of production activities under §§ 1.865-3(d)(2)(i) and 1.863-3 (in this case, $0x), is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of A's U.S. trade or business, or $125,000x.
(ii)
Example 2. Sales of inventory purchased and resold through a U.S. sales office by a nonresident alien with a tax home in the United States.
Individual B, who is a nonresident alien within the meaning of section 7701(b)(1)(B) and has a tax home in the United States, has an office in a foreign country that purchases merchandise and sells it through B's sales office in the United States for use in various foreign countries, with title to the property passing outside the United States. B is not a nonresident within the meaning of section 865(g)(1)(B). Therefore, § 1.865-3 does not apply to B's sale of the merchandise, except to the extent provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. No other office of B materially participates in these sales made through its U.S. office. By reason of its sales activities in the United States, B is engaged in business in the United States during the taxable year. During the taxable year, B derives income of $300,000x from these sales made through its U.S. sales office. All of B's income from these sales is foreign source as B purchases the merchandise outside the United States and title to the merchandise also passes outside the United States. The amount of income properly allocable to B's U.S. office determined under § 1.865-3(d)(3) is $300,000x, and thus $300,000x is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of B's U.S. trade or business.
(iii)
Example 3. Foreign sales office also materially participates in sale.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section (the facts in
Example 2
), except that B also has an office in a foreign country that is a material factor in the realization of income from the sales made through B's U.S. office. No income from the sale of merchandise is allocable to B's U.S. sales office for the taxable year, by reason of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, and thus none of the $300,000x is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of B's U.S. trade or business.
(iv)
Example 4. Sales of inventory purchased and resold through a U.S. sales office by a foreign corporation.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section (the facts in
Example 2
), except that B is a foreign corporation. B is a nonresident within the meaning of section 865(g)(1)(B). The income from such sales will be sourced in accordance with § 1.865-3(a) and (d)(3).
(4)
Applicability date.
Paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies to taxable years ending on or after December 23, 2019. However, a taxpayer may apply paragraph (c)(2) of this section in its entirety for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending before December 23, 2019, provided that the taxpayer and all persons related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) apply paragraph (c)(2) of this section and §§ 1.863-1(b), 1.863-2(b), 1.863-3, 1.863-8(b)(3)(ii), 1.864-5(a) and (b), and 1.865-3 in their entirety for the taxable year, and once applied, the taxpayer and all persons related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) continue to apply these regulations in their entirety for all subsequent taxable years. For regulations generally applicable to taxable years ending before December 23, 2019, see § 1.864-6 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2020.

nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation that is engaged in a trade or business in the United States at some time during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, has an office or other fixed place of business in the United States for purposes of applying section 864(c)(4)(B) and § 1.864-6 to income, gain, or loss specified in paragraph (b) of § 1.864-5 from sources without the United States or has an office or other fixed place of business outside the United States for purposes of applying section 864(c)(4)(B)(iii) and paragraph (b)(3)(i) of § 1.864-6 to sales of goods or merchandise for use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States.
(2) In making a determination under this section due regard shall be given to the facts and circumstances of each case, particularly to the nature of the taxpayer's trade or business and the physical facilities actually required by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the conduct of his trade or business.
(3) The law of a foreign country shall not be controlling in determining whether a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation has an office or other fixed place of business.
(b)
Fixed facilities
—(1)
In general.
As a general rule, an office or other fixed place of business is a fixed facility, that is, a place, site, structure, or other similar facility, through which a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation engages in a trade or business. For this purpose an office or other fixed place of business shall include, but shall not be limited to, a factory; a store or other sales outlet; a workshop; or a mine, quarry, or other place of extraction of natural resources. A fixed facility may be considered an office or other fixed place of business whether or not the facility is continuously used by a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation.
(2)
Use of another person's office or other fixed place of business.
A nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation shall not be considered to have an office or other fixed place of business merely because such alien individual or foreign corporation uses another person's office or other fixed place of business, whether or not the office or place of business of a related person, through which to transact a trade or business, if the trade or business activities of the alien individual or foreign corporation in that office or other fixed place of business are relatively sporadic or infrequent, taking into account the overall needs and conduct of that trade or business.
(c)
Management activity.
A foreign corporation shall not be considered to have an office or other fixed place of business merely because a person controlling that corporation has an office or other fixed place of business from which general supervision and control over the policies of the foreign corporation are exercised. The fact that top management decisions affecting the foreign corporation are made in a country shall not of itself mean that the foreign corporation has an office or other fixed place of business in that country. For example, a foreign sales corporation which is a wholly owned subsidiary of a domestic corporation shall not be considered to have an office or other fixed place of business in the United States merely because of the presence in the United States of officers of the domestic parent corporation who are generally responsible only for the policy decisions affecting the foreign sales corporation, provided that the foreign corporation has a chief executive officer, whether or not he is also an officer of the domestic parent corporation, who conducts the day-to-day trade or business of the foreign corporation from a foreign office. The result in this example would be the same even if the executive officer should (1) regularly confer with the officers of the domestic parent corporation, (2) occasionally visit the U.S. office of the domestic parent corporation, and (3) during such visits to the United States temporarily conduct the business of the foreign subsidiary corporation out of the domestic parent corporation's office in the United States.
(d)
Agent activity
—(1)
Dependent agents
—(i)
In general.
In determining whether a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation has an office or other fixed place of business, the office or other fixed place of business of an agent who is not an independent agent, as defined in subparagraph (3) of
this paragraph, shall be disregarded unless such agent (
a
) has the authority to negotiate and conclude contracts in the name of the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation, and regularly exercises that authority, or (
b
) has a stock of merchandise belonging to the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation from which orders are regularly filed on behalf of such alien individual or foreign corporation. A person who purchases goods from a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation shall not be considered to be an agent for such alien individual or foreign corporation for purposes of this paragraph where such person is carrying on such purchasing activities in the ordinary course of its own business, even though such person is related in some manner to the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation. For example, a wholly owned domestic subsidiary corporation of a foreign corporation shall not be treated as an agent of the foreign parent corporation merely because the subsidiary corporation purchases goods from the foreign parent corporation and resells them in its own name. However, if the domestic subsidiary corporation regularly negotiates and concludes contracts in the name of its foreign parent corporation or maintains a stock of merchandise from which it regularly fills orders on behalf of the foreign parent corporation, the office or other fixed place of business of the domestic subsidiary corporation shall be treated as the office or other fixed place of business of the foreign parent corporation unless the domestic subsidiary corporation is an independent agent within the meaning of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(ii)
Authority to conclude contracts or fill orders.
For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, an agent shall be considered regularly to exercise authority to negotiate and conclude contracts or regularly to fill orders on behalf of his foreign principal only if the authority is exercised, or the orders are filled, with some frequency over a continuous period of time. This determination shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances in each case, taking into account the nature of the business of the principal; but, in all cases, the frequency and continuity tests are to be applied conjunctively. Regularity shall not be evidenced by occasional or incidental activity. An agent shall not be considered regularly to negotiate and conclude contracts on behalf of his foreign principal if the agent's authority to negotiate and conclude contracts is limited only to unusual cases or such authority must be separately secured by the agent from his principal with respect to each transaction effected.
(2)
Independent agents.
The office or other fixed place of business of an independent agent, as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, shall not be treated as the office or other fixed place of business of his principal who is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, irrespective of whether such agent has authority to negotiate and conclude contracts in the name of his principal, and regularly exercises that authority, or maintains a stock of goods from which he regularly fills orders on behalf of his principal.
(3)
Definition of independent agent
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “independent agent” means a general commission agent, broker, or other agent of an independent status acting in the ordinary course of his business in that capacity. Thus, for example, an agent who, in pursuance of his usual trade or business, and for compensation, sells goods or merchandise consigned or entrusted to his possession, management, and control for that purpose by or for the owner of such goods or merchandise is an independent agent.
(ii)
Related persons.
The determination of whether an agent is an independent agent for purposes of this paragraph shall be made without regard to facts indicating that either the agent or the principal owns or controls directly or indirectly the other or that a third person or persons own or control directly or indirectly both. For example, a wholly owned domestic subsidiary corporation of a foreign corporation which acts as an agent for the foreign parent corporation may be treated as acting in the capacity of
independent agent for the foreign parent corporation. The facts and circumstances of a specific case shall determine whether the agent, while acting for his principal, is acting in pursuance of his usual trade or business and in such manner as to constitute him an independent agent in his relations with the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation.
(iii)
Exclusive agents.
Where an agent who is otherwise an independent agent within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph acts in such capacity exclusively, or almost exclusively, for one principal who is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, the facts and circumstances of a particular case shall be taken into account in determining whether the agent, while acting in that capacity, may be classified as an independent agent.
(e)
Employee activity.
Ordinarily, an employee of a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation shall be treated as a dependent agent to whom the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section apply if such employer does not in and of itself have a fixed facility (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) in the United States or outside the United States, as the case may be. However, where the employee, in the ordinary course of his duties, carries on the trade or business of his employer in or through a fixed facility of such employer which is regularly used by the employee in the course of carrying out such duties, such fixed facility shall be considered the office or other fixed place of business of the employer, irrespective of the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
M, a foreign corporation, opens a showroom office in the United States for the purpose of promoting its sales of merchandise which it purchases in foreign country X. The employees of the U.S. office, consisting of salesmen and general clerks, are empowered only to run the office, to arrange for the appointment of distributing agents for the merchandise offered by M, and to solicit orders generally. These employees do not have the authority to negotiate and conclude contracts in the name of M, nor do they have a stock of merchandise from which to fill orders on behalf of M. Any negotiations entered into by these employees are under M's instructions and subject to its approval as to any decision reached. The only independent authority which the employees have is in the appointment of distributors to whom M is to sell merchandise, but even this authority is subject to the right of M to approve or disapprove these buyers on receipt of information as to their business standing. Under the circumstances, this office used by a group of salesmen for sales promotion is a fixed place of business which M has in the United States.
(f)
Office or other fixed place of business of a related person.
The fact that a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation is related in some manner to another person who has an office or other fixed place of business shall not of itself mean that such office or other fixed place of business of the other person is the office or other fixed place of business of the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation. Thus, for example, the U.S. office of foreign corporation M, a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of foreign corporation N, shall not be considered the office or other fixed place of business of N unless the facts and circumstances show that N is engaged in trade or business in the United States through that office or other fixed place of business. However, see paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(g)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
S, a foreign corporation, is engaged in the business of buying and selling tangible personal property. S is a wholly owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation engaged in the business of buying and selling similar property, which has an office in the United States. Officers of P are generally responsible for the policies followed by S and are directors of S, but S has an independent group of officers, none of whom are regularly employed in the United States. In addition to this group of officers, S has a chief executive officer, D, who is also an officer of P but who is permanently stationed outside the United States. The day-to-day conduct of S's business is handled by D and the other officers of such corporation, but they regularly confer with the officers of P and on occasion temporarily visit P's offices in the United States, at which time they continue to conduct the business of S. S does not have an office or other fixed place of business in the United States for purposes of this section.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that, on rare occasions, an employee of P receives an order which he, after consultation with officials of S and because P cannot fill the order, accepts on behalf of S rather than on behalf of P. P does not hold itself out as a person which those wishing to do business with S should contact. Assuming that orders for S are seldom handled in this manner and that they do not constitute a significant part of that corporation's business, S shall not be considered to have an office or other fixed place of business in the United States because of these activities of an employee of P.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that all orders received by S are subject to review by an officer of P before acceptance. S has a business office in the United States.

# Example 4.
S, a foreign corporation organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, is engaged in the business of manufacturing dresses in Puerto Rico and is entitled to an income tax exemption under the Puerto Rico Industrial Incentive Act of 1963. S is a wholly owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation engaged in the business of buying and selling dresses to customers in the United States. S sells most of the dresses it produces to P, the assumption being made that the income from these sales is derived from sources without the United States. P in turn sells these dresses in the United States in its name and through the efforts of its own employees and of distributors appointed by it. S does not have a fixed facility in the United States, and none of its employees are stationed in the United States. On occasion, employees of S visit the office of P in the United States, and executives of P visit the office of S in Puerto Rico, to discuss with one another matters of mutual business interest involving both corporations, including the strategy for marketing the dresses produced by S. These matters are also regularly discussed by such persons by telephone calls between the United States and Puerto Rico. S's employees do not otherwise participate in P's marketing activities. Officers of P are generally responsible for the policies followed by S and are directors of S, but S has a chief executive officer in Puerto Rico who, from its office therein, handles the day-to-day conduct of S's business. Based upon the facts presented, and assuming there are no other facts which would lead to a different determination, S shall not be considered to have an office or other fixed place of business in the United States for purposes of this section.

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in example 4 except that the dresses are manufactured by S in styles and designs furnished by P and out of goods and raw materials purchased by P and sold to S. Based upon the facts presented, and assuming there are no other facts which would lead to a different determination, S shall not be considered to have an office or other fixed place of business in the United States for purposes of this section.

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in example 5 except that, pursuant to the instructions of P, the dresses sold by P are shipped by S directly to P's customers in the United States. Based upon the facts presented, and assuming there are no other facts which would lead to a different determination, S shall not be considered to have an office or other fixed place of business in the United States for purposes of this section.

§ 1.864-8T
Treatment of related person factoring income (temporary).
(a)
Applicability
—(1)
General rule.
This section applies for purposes of determining the treatment of income derived by a person from a trade or service receivable acquired from a related person. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if a person acquires (directly or indirectly) a trade or service receivable from a related person, any income (including any stated interest, discount or service fee) derived from the trade or service receivable shall be treated as if it were interest received on a loan to the obligor under the receivable. The characterization of income as interest pursuant to this section shall apply only for purposes of sections 551-558 (relating to foreign personal holding companies), sections 951-964 (relating to controlled foreign corporations), and section 904 (relating to the limitation on the foreign tax credit) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. The principles of sections 861 through 863 and the regulations thereunder shall be applied to determine the source of such interest income for purposes of section 904.
(2)
Override.
With respect to income characterized as interest under this section, the special rules of section 864(d) and this section override any conflicting provisions of the Code and regulations relating to foreign personal holding companies, controlled foreign corporations, and the foreign tax credit limitation. Thus, for example, pursuant to section 864(d)(5) and paragraph (e) of this section, stated interest derived from a factored trade or service receivable is not eligible for the subpart F de minimis rule of section
954(b)(3), the same country exception of section 954(c)(3)(A)(i), or the special rules for export financing interest of sections 904(d)(2) and 954(c)(2)(B), even if in the absence of this section the treatment of such stated interest would be governed by those sections.
(3)
Limitation.
Section 864(d) and this section apply only with respect to the tax treatment of income derived from a trade or service receivable acquired from a related person. Therefore, neither section 864(d) nor this section affects the characterization of an expense or loss of either the seller of a receivable or the obligor under a receivable. Accordingly, the obligor under a trade or service receivable shall not be allowed to treat any part of the purchase price of property or services as interest (other than amounts treated as interest under provisions other than section 864(d)).
(b)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section and § 1.956-3T.
(1)
Trade or service receivable.
The term “trade or service receivable” means any account receivable or evidence of indebtedness, whether or not issued at a discount and whether or not bearing stated interest, arising out of the disposition by a related person of property described in section 1221(l) (hereinafter referred to as “inventory property”) or the performance of services by a related person.
(2)
Related person.
A “related person” is:
(i) A person who is a related person within the meaning of section 267(b) and the regulations thereunder;
(ii) A United States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)); or
(iii) A person who is related (within the meaning of section 267(b) and the regulations thereunder) to a United States shareholder.
(c)
Acquisition of a trade or service receivable
—(1)
General rule.
A trade or service receivable is considered to be acquired by a person at the time when that person is entitled to receive all or a portion of the income from the trade or service receivable. A person who acquires a trade or service receivable (hereinafter referred to as the “factor”) is considered to have acquired a trade or service receivable regardless of whether:
(i) The acquisition is characterized for federal income tax purposes as a sale, a pledge of collateral for a loan, an assignment, a capital contribution, or otherwise;
(ii) The factor takes title to or obtains physical possession of the trade or service receivable;
(iii) The related person assigns the trade or service receivable with or without recourse:
(iv) The factor or some other person is obligated to collect the payments due under the trade or service receivable;
(v) The factor is liable for all property, excise, sales, or similar taxes due upon collection of the receivable;
(vi) The factor advances the entire face amount of the trade or service receivable transferred;
(vii) All trade or service receivables assigned by the related person are assigned to one factor; and
(viii) The obligor under the trade or service receivable is notified of the assignment.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c)(1) of this section.

# Example.
P, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS, a controlled foreign corporation. P manufactures and sells paper products to customers, including X, an unrelated domestic corporation. As part of a sales transaction, P takes back a trade receivable from X and sells the receivable to FS. Because FS has acquired a trade or service receivable from a related person, the income derived by FS from P's receivable is interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(3)
Indirect acquisitions
—(i)
Acquisition through unrelated person.
A trade or service receivable will be considered to be acquired from a related person if it is acquired from an unrelated person who acquired (directly or indirectly) such receivable from a person who is a related person to the factor. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(3)(i).

# Example.
A, a United States citizen, owns all of the outstanding stock of FPHC, a foreign personal holding company. A performs engineering services within and without the United States for customers, including X, an
unrelated corporation. A performs engineering services for X and takes back a service receivable. A sells the receivable to Y, an unrelated corporation engaged in the factoring business. Y resells the receivable to FPHC. Because FPHC has indirectly acquired a service receivable from a related person, the income derived by FPHC from A's receivable is interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Acquisition by nominee or pass-through entity.
A factor will be considered to have acquired a trade or service receivable held on its behalf by a nominee or by a partnership, simple trust, S corporation or other pass-through entity to the extent the factor owns (directly or indirectly) a beneficial interest in such partnership or other pass-through entity. The rule of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) does not limit the application of paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section regarding the characterization of trade or service receivables of unrelated persons acquired pursuant to certain swap or pooling arrangements. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii).

# Example.
FS1, a controlled foreign corporation, acquires a 20 percent limited partnership interest in PS, a partnership. PS purchases trade or service receivables resulting from the sale of inventory property by FS1's domestic parent, P. PS does not purchase receivables of any person who is related to any other partner in PS. FS1 is considered to have acquired a 20 percent interest in the receivables acquired by PS. Thus, FS1's distributive share of the income derived by PS from the receivables of P is considered to be interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(iii)
Swap or pooling arrangements.
A trade or service receivable of a person unrelated to the factor will be considered to be a trade or service receivable acquired from a related person and subject to the rules of this section if it is acquired in accordance with an arrangement that involves two or more groups of related persons that are unrelated to each other and the effect of the arrangement is that one or more related persons in each group acquire (directly or indirectly) trade or service receivables of one or more unrelated persons who are also parties to the arrangement, in exchange for reciprocal purchases of the first group's receivables. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii).

# Example.
Controlled foreign corporations A, B, C, and D are wholly-owned subsidiaries of domestic corporations M, N, O, and P, respectively. M, N, O, and P are not related persons. According to a prearranged plan, A, B, C, and D each acquire trade or service receivables of M, N, O, and/or P, except that neither A, B, C nor D acquires receivables of its own parent corporation. Because the effect of this arrangement is that the unrelated groups acquire each other's trade or service receivables pursuant to the arrangement, income derived by A, B, C, and D from the receivables acquired from M, N, O, and P is interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(iv)
Financing arrangements.
If a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957(a)) participates (directly or indirectly) in a lending transaction that results in a loan to the purchaser of inventory property, services, or trade or service receivables of a related person (or a loan to a person who is related to the purchaser), and if the loan would not have been made or maintained on the same terms but for the corresponding purchase, then the controlled foreign corporation shall be considered to have indirectly acquired a trade or service receivable, and income derived by the controlled foreign corporation from such a loan shall be considered to be income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(iv), it is immaterial that the sums lent are not, in fact, the sums used to finance the purchase of a related person's inventory property, services, or trade or service receivables. The amount of income derived by the controlled foreign corporation to be taken into account shall be the total amount of income derived from a lending transaction described in this paragraph (c)(3)(iv), if the amount lent is less than or equal to the purchase price of the inventory property, services, or trade or service receivables. If the amount lent is greater than the purchase price of the inventory property, services or receivables, the amount to be taken into account shall be the proportion of the interest charge (including original issue discount) that the purchase price bears to the total amount lent pursuant to the lending transaction. The following
examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(3)(iv).

# Example 1.
P, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS1, a controlled foreign corporation engaged in the financing business in Country X. P manufactures and sells toys, including sales to C, an unrelated corporation. Prior to P's sale of toys to C for $2,000, D, a wholly-owned Country X subsidiary of C, borrows $3,000 from FS1. The loan from FS1 to D would not have been made or maintained on the same terms but for C's purchase of toys from P. Two-thirds of the income derived by FS1 from the loan to D is interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 2.
P, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS1, a controlled foreign corporation organized under the laws of Country X. FS1 has accumulated cash reserves. P has uncollected trade and service receivables of foreign obligors. FS1 makes a $1,000 loan to U, a foreign corporation that is unrelated to P or FS1. U purchases P's trade and service receivables for $2,000. The loan would not have been made or maintained on the same terms but for U's purchase of P's receivables. The income derived by U from the receivables is not interest income within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section. However, the interest paid by U to FS1 is interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in Example (2), except that U is a wholly-owned Country Y subsidiary of FS1. Because U is related to P within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, income derived by U from P's receivables is interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In addition, the income derived by FS1 from the loan to U is interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(d)
Same country exception
—(1)
Income from trade or service receivables.
Income derived from a trade or service receivable acquired from a related person shall not be treated as interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if:
(i) The person acquiring the trade or service receivable and the related person are created or organized under the laws of the same foreign country;
(ii) The related person has a substantial part of its assets used in its trade or business located in such foreign country; and
(iii) The related person would not have derived foreign base company income, as defined in section 954(a) and the regulations thereunder, or income effectively connected with a United States trade or business from such receivable if the related person had collected the receivable.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the standards contained in § 1.954-2(e) shall apply in determining the location of a substantial part of the assets of a related person. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, a determination of whether the related person would have derived foreign base company income shall be made without regard to the de minimis test described in section 954(b)(3)(A). The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d)(1).

# Example 1.
FS1, a controlled foreign corporation incorporated under the laws of Country X, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS2, which is also incorporated under the laws of Country X. FS1 has a substantial part of its assets used in its business in Country X. FS1 manufactures and sells toys for use in Country Y. The toys sold are considered to be manufactured in Country X under § 1.954-3(a)(2). FS1 is not considered to have a branch or similar establishment in Country Y that is treated as a separate corporation under section 954(d)(2) and § 1.954-3(b). Thus, gross income derived by FS1 from the toy sales is not foreign base company sales income. FS1 takes back receivables without stated interest from its customers. FS1 assigns those receivables to FS2. The income derived by FS2 from the receivables of FS1 is not interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, because it satisfies the same country exception under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the toys sold by FS1 are purchased from FS1's U.S. parent and are sold for use outside of Country X. Thus, any income derived by FS1 from the sale of the toys would be foreign base company sales income. Therefore, income derived by FS2 from the receivables of FS1 is interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. FS2 is considered to derive interest income from the receivable even if, solely by reason of the de minimis rule of section 954(b)(3)(A), FS1 would not have derived foreign base company income if FS1 had collected the receivable.
(2)
Income from financing arrangements.
Income derived by a controlled foreign corporation from a loan to a person that purchases inventory property or services of a person that is related to the controlled foreign corporation, or from other loans described in
paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, shall not be treated as interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if:
(i) The person providing the financing and the related person are created or organized under the laws of the same foreign country;
(ii) The related person has a substantial part of its assets used in its trade or business located in such foreign country; and
(iii) The related person would not have derived foreign base company income or income effectively connected with a United States trade or business:
(A) From the sale of inventory property or services to the borrower or from financing the borrower's purchase of inventory property or services, in the case of a loan to the purchaser of inventory property or services of a related person; or
(B) From collecting amounts due under the receivable or from financing the purchase of the receivable, in the case of a loan to the purchaser of a trade or service receivable of a related person.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the standards contained in § 1.954-2(e) shall apply in determining the location of a substantial part of the assets of a related person. For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, a determination of whether the related person would have derived foreign base company income shall be made without regard to the de minimis test described in section 954(b)(3)(A). The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d)(2).

# Example 1.
FS1, a controlled foreign corporation incorporated under the laws of Country X, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS2, which is also incorporated under the laws of Country X. FS1, which has a substantial part of its assets used in its business located in Country X, manufactures and sells toys for use in Country Y. The toys sold are considered to be manufactured in Country X under § 1.954-3(a)(2). FS1 is not considered to have a branch or similar establishment in Country Y that is treated as a separate corporation under section 954(d)(2) and § 1.954-3(b). Thus, the gross income derived by FS1 from the toy sales is not foreign base company sales income. FS2 makes a loan to FS3, a wholly-owned subsidiary of FS1 which is also incorporated under the laws of Country X, in connection with FS3's purchase of toys from FS1. FS3 does not earn any subpart F gross income. Thus, FS1 would not have derived foreign personal holding company interest income if FS1 had made the loan to FS3, because the interest would be covered by the same country exception of section 954(c)(3). Therefore, the income derived by FS2 from its loan to FS3 is not treated as interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, because it satisfies the same country exception under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Such income is also not treated as foreign personal holding company income described in section 954(c)(1)(A) because the same country exception of section 954(c)(3) also applies to the interest actually derived by FS2 from its loan to FS3.

# Example 2.
FS1, a controlled foreign corporation incorporated under the laws of Country X, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS2, which is also incorporated under the laws of Country X. FS1 purchases toys from its U.S. parent and resells them for use outside of Country X. As part of a sales transaction, FS1 takes back trade receivables. FS2 makes a loan to U, an unrelated corporation, to finance U's purchase of FS1's trade receivables. Because FS1 would have derived foreign base company income if FS1 had collected the receivables or made the loan itself, the same country exception of paragraph (d)(2) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, the income derived by FS2 from its loan to U is treated as interest income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

For purposes of sections 551-558 (relating to foreign personal holding companies), the exclusion provided by section 552(c) for interest described in section 954(c)(3)(A) shall not apply to income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For purposes of the sections 951-964 (relating to controlled foreign corporations), income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be included in a United States shareholder's pro rata share of a controlled foreign corporation's subpart F income without regard to the de minimis rule under section 954(b)(3)(A). However, income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be included in the computation of a controlled foreign corporation's foreign base company income for purposes of applying the de minimis rule under section 954(b)(3)(A) and the more than 70 percent of gross income test under
section 954(b)(3)(B). In addition, income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be considered to be subpart F income without regard to the exclusions from foreign base company income provided by section 954(c)(2)(B) (relating to export financing interest derived in the conduct of a banking business) and section 954(c)(3)(A)(i) (relating to certain interest income received from related persons).
(2)
Foreign tax credit.
Income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be considered to be interest income for purposes of the section 904 foreign tax credit limitation and is not eligible for the exceptions for export financing interest provided in section 904(d)(2) (A)(iii)(II), (B)(ii), and (C)(iii). In addition, such income will be subject to the look-through rule for subpart F income set forth in section 904(d)(3) without regard to the de minimis exception provided in section 904(d)(3)(E).
(3)
Possessions corporations
—(i)
Limitation on credit.
Income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not be treated as income described in section 936(a)(1) (A) or (B) unless the income is considered under the principles of § 1.863-6 to be derived from sources within the possessions. Thus, the credit provided by section 936 is not available for income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section unless the obligor under the receivable is a resident of a possession. In the case of a loan described in section 864(d)(6), the credit provided by section 936 is not available for income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section unless the purchaser of the inventory property or services is a resident of a possession.
(ii)
Eligibility determination.
Notwithstanding the limitation on the availability of the section 936 credit for income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if income treated as interest income under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is derived from sources within a possession (determined without regard to this section), such income shall be eligible for inclusion in a corporation's gross income for purposes of section 936(a)(2)(A). If such income is derived from the active conduct of a trade or business within a possession (determined without regard to this section), such income shall be eligible for inclusion in a corporation's gross income for purposes of section 936(a)(2)(B). (These rules apply for purposes of determining whether a corporation is eligible to elect the credit provided under section 936(a).)
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

# Example.
Corporation X is operating in a possession as a possessions corporation. In 1985, X earned $50,000 from the active conduct of a business in the possession, including $5,000 from trade or service receivables acquired from a related party. Obligors under the receivables acquired by X are not residents of the possession. Corporation X also earned $20,000 from activities other than its active conduct of business in the possession. The $5,000 derived by X from the receivables is not eligible for the section 936 credit. However, the $5,000 may be used by X to meet the percentage tests under section 936(a)(2) to the extent that such income is considered to be derived from sources within the possession (for purposes of section 936(a)(2)(A)) or is considered to be derived from the active conduct of a trade or business in the possession (for purposes of section 936(a)(2)(B)), in either case determined without regard to the characterization of such income under this section.
(f)
Effective date.
The provisions of this section shall apply with respect to accounts receivable and evidences of indebtedness transferred after March 1, 1984 and are effective June 14, 1988.

Gain or loss by foreign persons on the disposition of certain partnership interests.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides rules and definitions under section 864(c)(8). Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general rule treating gain or loss recognized by a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest as effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining the limitations on the amount of effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss under section 864(c)(8) and paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules regarding coordination with section 897. Paragraph (e)
of this section provides rules regarding certain tiered partnerships. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules regarding U.S. income tax treaties. Paragraph (g) of this section provides definitions. Paragraph (h) of this section provides a rule regarding certain contributions of property to a partnership. Paragraph (i) of this section contains examples illustrating the rules set forth in this section. Paragraph (j) of this section provides the applicability date.
(b)
Gain or loss treated as effectively connected gain or loss
—(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, if a foreign transferor owns, directly or indirectly, an interest in a partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, outside capital gain, outside capital loss, outside ordinary gain, or outside ordinary loss (each as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) recognized by the foreign transferor on the transfer of all (or any portion) of the interest is treated as effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss, subject to the limitations described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, this section does not apply to prevent any portion of the gain or loss that is otherwise treated as effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 864(c)(8) from being so treated.
(2)
Determination of outside gain and loss
—(i)
In general.
The amount of gain or loss recognized by the foreign transferor in connection with the transfer of its partnership interest is determined under all relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. See,
e.g.,
§§ 1.741-1(a) and 1.751-1(a)(2). For purposes of this section, the amount of gain or loss that is treated as capital gain or capital loss under sections 741 and 751 is referred to as
outside capital gain
or
outside capital loss,
respectively. The amount of gain or loss that is treated as ordinary gain or ordinary loss under sections 741 and 751 is referred to as
outside ordinary gain
or
outside ordinary loss,
respectively.
(ii)
Nonrecognition provisions.
A foreign transferor's gain or loss recognized in connection with the transfer of its partnership interest does not include gain or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is not recognized by reason of one or more nonrecognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
(3)
Limitations.
For purposes of applying this section, this paragraph (b)(3) limits the amount of gain or loss recognized by a foreign transferor that may be treated as effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss.
(i)
Capital gain limitation.
Outside capital gain recognized by a foreign transferor is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent it does not exceed aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(ii)
Capital loss limitation.
Outside capital loss recognized by a foreign transferor is treated as effectively connected loss to the extent it does not exceed aggregate deemed sale EC capital loss determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(iii)
Ordinary gain limitation.
Outside ordinary gain recognized by a foreign transferor is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent it does not exceed aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary gain determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(iv)
Ordinary loss limitation.
Outside ordinary loss recognized by a foreign transferor is treated as effectively connected loss to the extent it does not exceed aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary loss determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(c)
Amount treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
This paragraph (c) describes the steps to be followed in computing the limitations described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(1)
Step 1: Determine deemed sale gain and loss.
Determine the amount of gain or loss that the partnership would recognize with respect to each of its assets (other than interests in partnerships described in paragraph (e) of this section) upon a deemed sale of all of the partnership's assets on the date of the
transfer of the partnership interest described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section (deemed sale). For this purpose, a deemed sale is treated as a sale by the partnership to an unrelated person of each of its assets (tangible and intangible) in a fully taxable transaction for cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of each asset (taking into account section 7701(g)) immediately before the partner's transfer of the interest in the partnership. For rules concerning the deemed sale of certain partnership interests, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(2)
Step 2: Determine deemed sale EC gain and loss
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Effectively connected determination.
With respect to each asset deemed sold in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, determine the amount of gain or loss from the deemed sale that would be treated as effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss (including by reason of section 897). Gain described in this paragraph (c)(2) is referred to as
deemed sale EC gain,
and loss described in this paragraph (c)(2) is referred to as
deemed sale EC loss.
Section 864 and the regulations thereunder apply for purposes of determining whether deemed sale gain or loss would be treated as effectively connected gain or loss. See paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for sourcing rules that apply for purposes of determining deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss.
(B)
10-year exception.
For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, gain or loss from the deemed sale of an asset (other than a United States real property interest within the meaning of section 897(c)) will not be treated as deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss if—
(
1
) No income or gain produced by the asset was taxable as income that was effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by the partnership (or the foreign transferor, a predecessor of the foreign transferor, or a predecessor of the partnership) during the lesser of the ten-year period ending on the date of the transfer or the period for which the partnership (and, if applicable, the foreign transferor, a predecessor of the foreign transferor, and a predecessor of the partnership) held the asset; and
(
2
) The asset has not been used, or held for use, in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by the partnership (or the foreign transferor, a predecessor of the foreign transferor, or a predecessor of the partnership) during that same period.
(ii)
Sourcing rules for determining deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of applying section 865(e)(2)(A) in connection with the determination of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A), except to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B) through (E) of this section, the deemed sale of an asset will be treated as attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States. However, if the partnership does not maintain an office or other fixed place of business in the United States (within the meaning of section 864(c)(5)(A) and § 1.864-7), neither the office attribution described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A), nor the rules of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B) through (E) of this section, will apply.
(B)
Look-back rule for sale of inventory property.
The deemed sale of inventory property (as defined in section 865(i)(1)) will not be treated as attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States to the extent of
foreign source inventory gain or loss.
Foreign source inventory gain or loss is determined by multiplying the deemed sale gain or deemed sale loss attributable to inventory property by the foreign source inventory ratio. The foreign source inventory ratio cannot exceed one. If the amount in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section is not positive, the foreign source inventory ratio is zero. If the amount in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section is positive, but the amount in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section is not positive, the foreign source inventory ratio is one. The foreign source inventory ratio is—
(
1
) The gross income of the partnership from sources without the United States (as determined under sections 865(b) and 865(e)(2)) that was attributable to inventory property sold during the lesser of—
(
i
) The period comprised of the partnership's three taxable years immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale, or
(
ii
) The period beginning on the date the partnership (or any of its predecessors) was formed and ending on the last day of the partnership's taxable year immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale; over
(
2
) The total gross income of the partnership that was attributable to inventory property sold during that same period.
(C)
Look-back rule for intangibles.
The deemed sale of an intangible (as defined in section 865(d)(2), including going concern value) will not be treated as attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States to the extent of
foreign source intangible gain or loss.
Foreign source intangible gain or loss is determined by multiplying the deemed sale gain or deemed sale loss from an intangible, without regard to any gain described in section 865(d)(4)(A), by the foreign source intangible ratio. The foreign source intangible ratio cannot exceed one. If the amount in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section is not positive, the foreign source intangible ratio is zero. If the amount in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section is positive, but the amount in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section is not positive, the foreign source inventory ratio is one. The foreign source intangible ratio is—
(
1
) The gross ordinary income (other than from dispositions of depreciable or amortizable property) of the partnership from sources without the United States that was not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, during the lesser of—
(
i
) The period comprised of the partnership's three taxable years immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale, or
(
ii
) The period beginning on the date the partnership (or any of its predecessors) is formed and ending on the last day of the partnership's taxable year immediately preceding the year in which the deemed sale occurs; over
(
2
) The total gross ordinary income (other than from dispositions of depreciable or amortizable property) of the partnership during that period.
(D)
Depreciable personal property
—(
1
)
Depreciation recapture.
The deemed sale of depreciable personal property (as defined in section 865(c)(4)(A)), including from the sale of an amortizable intangible (as defined in section 865(d)(2)), will not be treated as attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States to the extent the deemed sale gain would be treated as from sources outside the United States after applying section 865(c)(1) at the time of the deemed sale.
(
2
)
Gain in excess of depreciation or loss with respect to depreciable personal property.
For purposes of this section, if the deemed sale of depreciable personal property (other than an amortizable intangible) results in deemed sale gain in excess of the property's depreciation adjustments (as defined in section 865(c)(4)(B)), or results in deemed sale loss, attribution to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States with respect to the excess deemed sale gain, or deemed sale loss, will be determined based on where the property is located: If the property is located outside the United States, the excess deemed sale gain, or the deemed sale loss, will not be treated as attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States; if the property is located within the United States, the excess deemed sale gain, or the deemed sale loss, will be treated as attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States.
(E)
Material change in circumstances rule.
If a material change in circumstances occurred that causes the applicable rule provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section to provide a sourcing result that is materially different from the sourcing result that would occur if the applicable period described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) or (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section began on the date on which the material change in circumstance occurred and ended on the last day of the partnership's taxable year immediately preceding the year in which the deemed
sale occurs (the
modified look-back period
), the applicable rule provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section may be applied by reference to the modified look-back period. The difference between the sourcing results is determined by comparing the foreign source inventory ratio (as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) or the foreign source intangible ratio (as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section), as applicable, with the foreign source inventory ratio or foreign source intangible ratio, as applicable, if that ratio were determined by reference to the modified look-back period. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E), the sourcing results will not be materially different unless the percentage point difference between the ratios described in the preceding sentence is at least 30 percentage points.
(iii)
Examples.
This paragraph (c)(2)(iii) provides examples that illustrate the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Except as otherwise provided, the following facts apply for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii). FP is a foreign corporation and a partner in PRS, a partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (the U.S. Business) and a business in Country A (the Country A Business). Both businesses purchase inventory property and sell the purchased inventory property to unrelated customers; this is the only income-generating activity carried on by the businesses. PRS maintains an office or fixed place of business within the U.S. (within the meaning of section 864(c)(5)(A) and § 1.864-7) and, for its U.S. business, PRS sells its inventory property through its U.S. office. For the Country A business, PRS sells its inventory property through its Country A office for consumption in Country A; PRS's Country A office materially participates in each sale. The gain or loss from the inventory sold through PRS's Country A office is treated as from sources without the United States and is not effectively connected with PRS's U.S. Business. In year 4, FP sells its entire interest in PRS, thereby triggering the deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In the deemed sale, PRS recognizes $10x of gain on the sale of its inventory property (the only asset PRS holds other than goodwill and going concern value). The 10-year exception provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section does not apply.
(A)
Example 1: Determining foreign source inventory gain
—(
1
)
Facts.
Based on PRS's sales records for the three taxable years immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale, PRS's gross income from sources without the United States that is attributable to sales of inventory property is $12x and PRS's total gross income attributable to sales of inventory property during that period is $30x.
(
2
)
Analysis.
To determine foreign source inventory gain or loss described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the $10x deemed sale gain attributable to inventory property is multiplied by PRS's foreign source inventory ratio. PRS's foreign source inventory ratio is PRS's gross income from sources without the United States that are attributable to sales of inventory property within PRS's three taxable years preceding the date of the deemed sale, over PRS's total gross income attributable to sales of inventory property during the same period. Thus, based on PRS's sales records from the three taxable years preceding the date of the deemed sale, the foreign source inventory gain for PRS's inventory is $4x (the $10x deemed sale gain attributable to inventory multiplied by the foreign source inventory ratio of $12x over $30x).
(B)
Example 2: Determining deemed sale EC gain attributable to inventory property under the material change in circumstances rule
—(
1
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section (the facts of
Example 1
in this paragraph (c)(2)(iii)), except that at the beginning of year 3 (PRS's taxable year immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale), PRS started a new business in Country B (the Country B Business) to take advantage of favorable market prospects for its products in Country B. For the Country B Business, PRS sells its inventory property through its Country B office for consumption in Country B; PRS's Country B office materially participates in each
such sale. The gain or loss from the inventory sold through PRS's Country B office is foreign source gain or loss. Also, at the beginning of year 3, PRS substantially reduced its U.S. Business as a result of market factors. As a result of these changes in year 3, 95% of PRS's inventory property is sold in its Country A Business and Country B Business (collectively, the Foreign Businesses) beginning on the date in which these changes occurred; accordingly, 5% of PRS' inventory property is sold in its U.S. Business after these changes. Based on PRS's sales records for the three taxable years preceding the date of the deemed sale, PRS's gross income from sources without the United States that are attributable to sales of inventory property is $15x and PRS's total gross income attributable to sales of inventory property during that period is $30x; for year 3, PRS's gross income from sources without the United States that are attributable to sales of inventory property is $9.5x, and PRS's total gross income attributable to sales of inventory property in Year 3 is $10x.
(
2
)
Analysis.
The material change in circumstances rule described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section applies if due to a material change in circumstances, the sourcing rule provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section provides a sourcing result that is materially different from the sourcing result that would occur if that sourcing rule was applied by reference to the modified look-back period; that is, the period beginning on the date in which a material chance in circumstances occurred and ending on the last day of the PRS's taxable year immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale. For this purpose, the reduction in PRS's U.S. business in year 3, coupled with the creation of the Country B Business in the same year, qualifies as a material change in circumstances. Thus, the modified look-back period consists of year 3; that is, the period starting at the beginning of year 3, the date in which the material change in circumstances occurred, and ending of the last day of year 3, the last day of PRS's taxable year immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale. Based on PRS's sales records for the three taxable years preceding the deemed sale, the foreign source inventory ratio, expressed as a percentage, is 50% ($15x attributable to PRS's gross income from sources without the United States with respect to sales of its inventory property, over $30x attributable to PRS's total gross income with respect to sales of its inventory property). Due to the material change in circumstances, however, 95% of PRS's inventory property is sold in its Foreign Businesses. ($9.5x attributable to PRS's gross income from sources without the United States with respect to sales of its inventory property, over $10x attributable to PRS's total gross income with respect to sales of its inventory property.) Accordingly, if PRS applied the sourcing rule provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section by reference to the modified look-back period, 95% ($9.5x/$10x), or $9.5x, of the gain would be attributable to sales for PRS's Foreign Businesses (gain from sources without the United States), and only 5% ($.5x/$10x), or $0.5x, of the gain would be attributable to sales for PRS's U.S. Business (gain from United States sources). The excess of the foreign source inventory ratio determined by reference to the modified look-back period (expressed as a percentage), over the foreign source inventory ratio (also expressed as a percentage) is 45%; that is 95% (as determined under the modified look-back period) minus 50% (as determined under the foreign source inventory ratio). Accordingly, the sourcing results are materially different because the 45 percentage point difference is greater than the 30 percentage point threshold provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section. Thus, the material change in circumstances rule of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section applies and the foreign source inventory gain determined under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, determined by reference to the modified look-back period, is $9.5x; that is, the deemed sale gain attributable to inventory property ($10x), multiplied by the foreign source inventory ratio determined by reference to the modified look-back period ($9.5x/$10x).
(3)
Step 3: Determine the foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale
EC gain or deemed sale EC loss
—(i)
In general.
A foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss with respect to each asset is the amount of the deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section that would have been allocated to the foreign transferor by the partnership under all applicable Internal Revenue Code sections (including section 704) upon the deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, taking into account allocations of tax items applying the principles of section 704(c), including any remedial allocations (see § 1.704-3(d)), and any section 743(b) basis adjustments (see § 1.743-1(j)(3)). For this purpose, a foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss does not include any amount that is excluded from the foreign transferor's gross income or otherwise exempt from U.S. Federal income tax by reason of an applicable provision of the Internal Revenue Code (including, for example, by reason of section 864(b)(2), 872(b), or 883). Similarly, a foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss does not include any amount to which an exception under section 897 applies, such as section 897(k) or section 897(l), if that amount is not otherwise treated as effectively connected under a provision of the Code. For rules regarding the determination of a foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss under an applicable U.S. income tax treaty, see paragraph (f) of this section.
(ii)
Aggregate deemed sale EC items
—(A)
Ordinary gain or loss.
A foreign transferor's
aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary gain
(if the net aggregate of the foreign transferor's distributive share of the deemed sale EC ordinary gain and loss is a gain) or
aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary loss
(if the net aggregate of the foreign transferor's distributive share of the deemed sale EC ordinary gain and loss is a loss) is determined by taking into account—
(
1
) The portion of the foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss that is attributable to the deemed sale of the partnership's assets that are section 751(a) property; and
(
2
) Deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss from the deemed sale of assets that are section 751(a) property that would be allocated to the foreign transferor with respect to interests in partnerships that are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section upon the deemed asset sales described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
(B)
Capital gain or loss.
A foreign transferor's
aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain
(if the net aggregate of the foreign transferor's distributive share of the deemed sale EC capital gain and loss is a gain) or
aggregate deemed sale EC capital loss
(if the net aggregate of the foreign transferor's distributive share of the deemed sale EC capital gain and loss is a loss) is determined by taking into account—
(
1
) The portion of the foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss that is attributable to the deemed sale of assets that are not section 751(a) property; and
(
2
) Deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss from the sale of assets that are not section 751(a) property and that would be allocated to the foreign transferor with respect to all interests in partnerships that are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section upon the deemed asset sales described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
(iii)
Partial transfers.
If a foreign transferor transfers less than all of its interest in a partnership, then for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss is determined by reference to the amount of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss determined under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section that is attributable to the portion of the foreign transferor's partnership interest that was transferred.
(d)
Coordination with section 897.
If a foreign transferor transfers an interest in a partnership in a transfer that is subject to section 864(c)(8) and the partnership owns one or more United
States real property interests (as defined in section 897(c)), then the foreign transferor determines its effectively connected gain and effectively connected loss under this section, and not pursuant to section 897(g). Accordingly, with respect to a transfer that is subject to section 864(c)(8), section 864(c)(8)(C) does not reduce the amount of gain or loss treated as effectively connected gain or loss under this section. For rules regarding a transfer not subject to section 864(c)(8) of an interest in a partnership that owns one or more United States real property interests, see section 897(g) and the regulations thereunder. If a foreign transferor transfers an interest in a partnership in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the transfer is treated as not subject to section 864(c)(8) to the extent of the gain or loss that is not recognized; instead, if the partnership owns one or more United States real property interests at the time of transfer, the rules of section 897(g) and the regulations thereunder apply to the unrecognized gain or loss.
(e)
Tiered partnerships
—(1)
Transfers of upper-tier partnerships.
Assets sold in a deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not include interests in partnerships that are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States or interests in partnerships that hold, directly or indirectly, partnerships that are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Rather, if a foreign transferor transfers an interest in a partnership (upper-tier partnership) that owns, directly or indirectly, an interest in one or more partnerships that are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, then—
(i) Beginning with the lowest-tier partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States in a chain of partnerships and going up the chain, each partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States is treated as selling its assets in a deemed sale in accordance with the principles of paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and
(ii) Each partnership must determine its deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss in accordance with the principles of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and determine the distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss for each partner that is either a partnership (in which the foreign transferor is a direct or indirect partner) or a foreign transferor, in accordance with the principles of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
(2)
Transfers by upper-tier partnerships.
If a foreign transferor is a direct or indirect partner in an upper-tier partnership and the upper-tier partnership transfers an interest in a partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (including a partnership held indirectly through one or more partnerships), then the principles of this section (including paragraph (e)(1) of this section) apply with respect to the gain or loss on the transfer that is allocated to the foreign transferor by the upper-tier partnership.
(3)
Coordination with section 897.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), a lower-tier partnership that holds one or more United States real property interests is treated as engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
(f)
Treaty coordination.
This paragraph (f) describes how paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies in the case of a transfer of an interest in a partnership by a foreign transferor that is eligible for benefits under an applicable U.S. income tax treaty. As a general matter, a foreign transferor must satisfy the requirements of the limitation on benefits article, if any, in the treaty between the jurisdiction in which the transferor is resident and the United States to be eligible for treaty benefits. In the case of a foreign transferor that is entitled to treaty benefits, in determining the foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss, gain or loss derived by the foreign transferor attributable to assets deemed sold that would be exempt from tax under an applicable U.S. income tax treaty if disposed of by the partnership are not taken into account under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. In general, gain or
loss on the alienation of a partnership interest will be treated as effectively connected gain or loss under section 864(c)(8) to the extent that the gain or loss is either attributable to assets forming part of a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed place of business, or taxable under a provision governing the disposition of United States real property interests. Gain or loss from the alienation of a partnership interest will be considered gain or loss attributable to the alienation of assets forming part of a permanent establishment or fixed place of business in the United States to the extent the assets deemed sold under section 864(c)(8) form a part of the U.S. permanent establishment or fixed place of business of the partnership. If, however, after applying treaty benefits in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the only gains or losses that would be taken into account are gains or losses attributable to United States real property interests, the foreign transferor determines its effectively connected gain and effectively connected loss pursuant to section 897 and not under this section.
(g)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.
(1)
Effectively connected gain.
The term
effectively connected gain
means gain that is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
(2)
Effectively connected loss.
The term
effectively connected loss
means loss treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
(3)
Foreign transferor.
The term
foreign transferor
means a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation.
(4)
Section 751(a) property.
The term
section 751(a) property
means unrealized receivables described in section 751(c) and inventory items described in section 751(d).
(5)
Transfer.
The term
transfer
means a sale, exchange, or other disposition, and includes a distribution from a partnership to a partner to the extent that gain or loss is recognized on the distribution, as well as a transfer treated as a sale or exchange under section 707(a)(2)(B).
(h)
Anti-stuffing rule.
If a foreign transferor (or a person that is related to a foreign transferor within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)) transfers property (including another partnership interest) to a partnership in a transaction with a principal purpose of reducing the amount of gain treated as effectively connected gain, or increasing the amount of loss treated as effectively connected loss, under section 864(c)(8) or section 897, the transfer is disregarded for purposes of section 864(c)(8) or section 897, as appropriate.
(i)
Examples.
This paragraph (i) provides examples that illustrate the rules of this section. Except as otherwise provided, the following facts are presumed for purposes of this paragraph (i). FP is a foreign corporation. USP is a domestic corporation. PRS is a partnership that was formed on January 1, 2018, when FP and USP each contributed $100x in cash. PRS has made no distributions and received no contributions other than those described in the preceding sentence. FP's adjusted basis in its interest in PRS is $100x. X is a foreign corporation that is unrelated to FP, USP, or PRS. Upon the formation of PRS, FP and USP entered into an agreement providing that all income, gain, loss, and deduction of PRS will be allocated equally between FP and USP. PRS is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (the U.S. Business) and an unrelated business in Country A (the Country A Business). In a deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, gain or loss on assets of the U.S. Business would be treated as effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss, and gain or loss on assets of the Country A Business would not be so treated (including by reason of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section). PRS has no liabilities.

Analysis
—(A)
Outside gain or loss.
FP is a foreign transferor (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section) and transfers (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(5) of this section) its interest in PRS to X. For purposes of this example, for simplicity, PRS is assumed to hold no section 751(a) property and depreciation recapture is assumed to be zero. FP recognizes a $5x capital gain under section 741, which is an outside capital gain within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, FP's $5x capital gain is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent that it does not exceed the limitation described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, which is FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain.
(B)
Deemed sale.
FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is determined according to the three-step process set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. First, the amount of gain or loss that PRS would recognize with respect to each of its assets upon a deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is a $4x gain with respect to the U.S. Business section 1231 asset and a $6x gain with respect to the Country A Business capital asset. Second, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, PRS's deemed sale EC gain is $4x. Third, under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is $2x (that is, the aggregate of its distributive share of deemed sale EC gain attributable to the deemed sale of assets that are not section 751(a) property, which is 50% of $4x).
(C)
Limitation.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the $5x outside capital gain recognized by FP is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent that it does not exceed FP's $2x aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain. Accordingly, FP recognizes $2x of capital gain that is treated as effectively connected gain.

Outside gain or loss.
FP is a foreign transferor (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section) and transfers (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(5) of this section) its interest in PRS to X. For purposes of this example, for simplicity, PRS is assumed to hold no section 751(a) property and depreciation recapture is assumed to be zero. FP recognizes a $10x capital gain under section 741, which is an outside capital gain within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, FP's $10x capital gain is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent that it does not exceed the limitation described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, which is FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain.
(B)
Deemed sale.
FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is determined according to the three-step process set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. First, the amount of gain or
loss that PRS would recognize with respect to each of its assets upon a deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is a $50x gain with respect to the U.S. Business section 1231 asset and a $30x loss with respect to the Country A Business capital asset. Second, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, PRS's deemed sale EC gain is $50x. Third, under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is $25x (that is, the aggregate of its distributive share of deemed sale EC gain attributable to the deemed sale of assets that are not section 751(a) property, which is 50% of $50x).
(C)
Limitation.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the $10x outside capital gain recognized by FP is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent that it does not exceed FP's $25x aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain. Accordingly, FP recognizes $10x of capital gain that is treated as effectively connected gain.

Outside gain or loss.
FP is a foreign transferor (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section) and transfers (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(5) of this section) its interest in PRS to X. Under sections 741 and 751, FP recognizes a $10x ordinary loss and a $5x capital gain. See § 1.751-1(a). Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, FP has outside ordinary loss equal to $10x and outside capital gain equal to $5x. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, FP's outside ordinary loss and outside capital gain are treated as effectively connected loss and effectively connected gain to the extent that each does not exceed the applicable limitation described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. In the case of FP's outside ordinary loss, the applicable limitation is FP's aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary loss. In the case of FP's outside capital gain, the applicable limitation is FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain.
(B)
Deemed sale.
FP's aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary loss and aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain are determined according to the three-step process set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
(

)
Step 1.
The amount of gain or loss that PRS would recognize with respect to each of its assets upon a deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is as follows:
Asset
Gain/(loss)
U.S. Business section 1231 asset
$30x
U.S. Business inventory and receivables
20x
Country A Business capital asset
(20x)
Country A Business inventory
(40x)
(

)
Step 2.
Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, PRS's deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss must be determined with respect to each asset. The amounts determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section are as follows:
Asset
Deemed sale
EC gain/(loss)
U.S. Business section 1231 asset
$30x
U.S. Business inventory and receivables
20x

)
Step 3.
Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is
$15x (that is, the aggregate of its distributive share of deemed sale EC gain that is attributable to the deemed sale of assets that are not section 751(a) property, which is 50% of $30x) and FP's aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary loss is $0 (that is, the aggregate of its distributive share of deemed sale EC loss that is attributable to the deemed sale of assets that are section 751(a) property).
(C)
Limitation
—(i)
Capital gain.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the $5x outside capital gain recognized by FP is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent that it does not exceed FP's $15x aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain. Accordingly, the amount of FP's capital gain that is treated as effectively connected gain is $5x.
(ii)
Ordinary loss.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the $10x outside ordinary loss recognized by FP is treated as effectively connected loss to the extent that it does not exceed FP's $0 aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary loss. Accordingly, the amount of FP's ordinary loss that is treated as effectively connected loss is $0.

(B)
Treaty benefits.
FP is a qualified resident of Country A under a U.S. income tax treaty between the United States and Country A that is similar or identical in all material respects to the 2006 U.S. Model Income Tax Convention (the Treaty). PRS is treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of Country A tax law. PRS does not carry on its U.S. Business through a U.S. permanent establishment (PE).
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Outside gain or loss.
FP is a foreign transferor (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section) and transfers (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(5) of this section) its interest in PRS to X. For purposes of this example, for simplicity, PRS is assumed to hold no section 751(a) property and depreciation recapture is assumed to be zero. FP recognizes a $5x capital gain under section 741, which is an outside capital gain within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, FP's $5x capital gain is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent that it does not exceed the limitation described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, which is FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain.
(B)
Deemed sale.
FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is determined according to the three-step process set forth in paragraph (c) of this section by taking into account the treaty coordination rule under paragraph (f) of this section.
(
1
)
Step 1.
The amount of gain or loss that PRS would recognize with respect to each of its assets upon a deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is as follows:
Asset
Gain/(loss)
U.S. Business section 1231 asset
$4x
Country A Business capital asset
6x
(
2
)
Step 2.
Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, PRS's deemed sale EC gain is as follows:
Asset
Gain/(loss)
U.S. Business section 1231 asset
$4x
Country A Business capital asset
0x
(
3
)
Step 3.
FP is eligible for benefits under the Treaty and derives the gain on the deemed sale of U.S. Business section 1231 asset. Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) and paragraph (f) of this section, because gain from the disposition of the U.S. Business section 1231 asset does not form part of a U.S. PE, the
gain is exempt from U.S. tax under the Treaty, and is not taken into account in determining FP's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain under paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and paragraph (f) of this section. Therefore, FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is $0x under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(C)
Limitation.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the $5x outside capital gain recognized by FP is not treated as effectively connected gain since all of it would exceed FP's $0x aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain.
(j)
Applicability date.
This section applies to transfers occurring on or after December 26, 2018, and to amounts received on or after December 26, 2018, pursuant to an installment sale (as defined in section 453(b)) occurring on or after November 27, 2017.

[T.D. 9926, 85 FR 76931, Nov. 30, 2020]
§ 1.865-1
Loss with respect to personal property other than stock.
(a)
General rules for allocation of loss
—(1)
Allocation against gain.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.865-2 and paragraph (c) of this section, loss recognized with respect to personal property shall be allocated to the class of gross income and, if necessary, apportioned between the statutory grouping of gross income (or among the statutory groupings) and the residual grouping of gross income, with respect to which gain from a sale of such property would give rise in the hands of the seller. For purposes of this section, loss includes bad debt deductions under section 166 and loss on property that is marked-to-market (such as under section 475) and subject to the rules of this section. Thus, for example, loss recognized by a United States resident on the sale or worthlessness of a bond generally is allocated to reduce United States source income.
(2)
Loss attributable to foreign office.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.865-2 and paragraph (c) of this section, and except with respect to loss subject to paragraph (b) of this section, in the case of loss recognized by a United States resident with respect to property that is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business in a foreign country within the meaning of section 865(e)(3), the loss shall be allocated to reduce foreign source income if a gain on the sale of the property would have been taxable by the foreign country and the highest marginal rate of tax imposed on such gains in the foreign country is at least 10 percent. However, paragraph (a)(1) of this section and not this paragraph (a)(2) will apply if gain on the sale of such property would be sourced under section 865(c), (d)(1)(B), or (d)(3).
(3)
Loss recognized by United States citizen or resident alien with foreign tax home.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.865-2 and paragraph (c) of this section, and except with respect to loss
subject to paragraph (b) of this section, in the case of loss with respect to property recognized by a United States citizen or resident alien that has a tax home (as defined in section 911(d)(3)) in a foreign country, the loss shall be allocated to reduce foreign source income if a gain on the sale of such property would have been taxable by a foreign country and the highest marginal rate of tax imposed on such gains in the foreign country is at least 10 percent.
(4)
Allocation for purposes of section 904.
For purposes of section 904, loss recognized with respect to property that is allocated to foreign source income under this paragraph (a) shall be allocated to the separate category under section 904(d) to which gain on the sale of the property would have been assigned (without regard to section 904(d)(2)(A)(iii)(III)). For purposes of § 1.904-4(c)(2)(ii)(A), any such loss allocated to passive income shall be allocated (prior to the application of § 1.904-4(c)(2)(ii)(B)) to the group of passive income to which gain on a sale of the property would have been assigned had a sale of the property resulted in the recognition of a gain under the law of the relevant foreign jurisdiction or jurisdictions.
(5)
Loss recognized by partnership.
A partner's distributive share of loss recognized by a partnership with respect to personal property shall be allocated and apportioned in accordance with this section as if the partner had recognized the loss. If loss is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business of the partnership within the meaning of section 865(e)(3), such office or fixed place of business shall be considered to be an office of the partner for purposes of this section.
(b)
Special rules of application
—(1)
Depreciable property.
In the case of a loss recognized with respect to depreciable personal property, the gain referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is the gain that would be sourced under section 865(c)(1) (depreciation recapture).
(2)
Contingent payment debt instrument.
Loss described in the last sentence of § 1.1275-4(b)(9)(iv)(A) that is recognized with respect to a contingent payment debt instrument to which § 1.1275-4(b) applies (instruments issued for money or publicly traded property) shall be allocated to the class of gross income and, if necessary, apportioned between the statutory grouping of gross income (or among the statutory groupings) and the residual grouping of gross income, with respect to which interest income from the instrument (in the amount of the loss subject to this paragraph (b)(2)) would give rise.
(c)
Exceptions
—(1)
Foreign currency and certain financial instruments.
This section does not apply to loss governed by section 988 and loss recognized with respect to options contracts or derivative financial instruments, including futures contracts, forward contracts, notional principal contracts, or evidence of an interest in any of the foregoing.
(2)
Inventory.
This section does not apply to loss recognized with respect to property described in section 1221(a)(1).
(3)
Interest equivalents and trade receivables.
Loss subject to § 1.861-9T(b) (loss equivalent to interest expense and loss on trade receivables) shall be allocated and apportioned under the rules of § 1.861-9T and not under the rules of this section.
(4)
Unamortized bond premium.
If a taxpayer recognizing loss with respect to a bond (within the meaning of § 1.171-1(b)) did not amortize bond premium to the full extent permitted by section 171 and the regulations thereunder, then, to the extent of the amount of bond premium that could have been, but was not, amortized by the taxpayer, loss recognized with respect to the bond shall be allocated to the class of gross income and, if necessary, apportioned between the statutory grouping of gross income (or among the statutory groupings) and the residual grouping of gross income, with respect to which interest income from the bond was assigned.
(5)
Accrued interest.
Loss attributable to accrued but unpaid interest on a debt obligation shall be allocated to the class of gross income and, if necessary, apportioned between the statutory grouping of gross income (or among the statutory groupings) and the residual grouping of gross income, with respect to which interest income from the obligation was assigned. For purposes of this section, whether loss is
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest (rather than to principal) shall be determined under the principles of §§ 1.61-7(d) and 1.446-2(e).
(6)
Anti-abuse rules
—(i)
Transactions involving built-in losses.
If one of the principal purposes of a transaction is to change the allocation of a built-in loss with respect to personal property by transferring the property to another person, qualified business unit, office or other fixed place of business, or branch that subsequently recognizes the loss, the loss shall be allocated by the transferee as if it were recognized by the transferor immediately prior to the transaction. If one of the principal purposes of a change of residence is to change the allocation of a built-in loss with respect to personal property, the loss shall be allocated as if the change of residence had not occurred. If one of the principal purposes of a transaction is to change the allocation of a built-in loss on the disposition of personal property by converting the original property into other property and subsequently recognizing loss with respect to such other property, the loss shall be allocated as if it were recognized with respect to the original property immediately prior to the transaction. Transactions subject to this paragraph shall include, without limitation, reorganizations within the meaning of section 368(a), liquidations under section 332, transfers to a corporation under section 351, transfers to a partnership under section 721, transfers to a trust, distributions by a partnership, distributions by a trust, transfers to or from a qualified business unit, office or other fixed place of business, or branch, or exchanges under section 1031. A person may have a principal purpose of affecting loss allocation even though this purpose is outweighed by other purposes (taken together or separately).
(ii)
Offsetting positions.
If a taxpayer recognizes loss with respect to personal property and the taxpayer (or any person described in section 267(b) (after application of section 267(c)), 267(e), 318 or 482 with respect to the taxpayer) holds (or held) offsetting positions with respect to such property with a principal purpose of recognizing foreign source income and United States source loss, the loss shall be allocated and apportioned against such foreign source income. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(ii), positions are offsetting if the risk of loss of holding one or more positions is substantially diminished by holding one or more other positions.
(iii)
Matching rule.
If a taxpayer (or a person described in section 1059(c)(3)(C) with respect to the taxpayer) engages in a transaction or series of transactions with a principal purpose of recognizing foreign source income that results in the creation of a corresponding loss with respect to personal property (as a consequence of the rules regarding the timing of recognition of income, for example), the loss shall be allocated and apportioned against such income to the extent of the recognized foreign source income. For an example illustrating a similar rule with respect to stock loss, see § 1.865-2(b)(4)(iv)
Example 3.

Definitions
—(1)
Contingent payment debt instrument.
A contingent payment debt instrument is any debt instrument that is subject to § 1.1275-4.
(2)
Depreciable personal property.
Depreciable personal property is any property described in section 865(c)(4)(A).
(3)
Terms defined in § 1.861-8.
See § 1.861-8 for the meaning of
class of gross income, statutory grouping of gross income,
and
residual grouping of gross income.
(e)
Examples.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On January 1, 2000,
A,
a domestic corporation, purchases for $1,000 a machine that produces widgets, which
A
sells in the United States and throughout the world. Throughout
A
's holding period, the machine is located and used in Country
X.
During
A
's holding period,
A
incurs depreciation deductions of $400 with respect to the machine. Under § 1.861-8,
A
allocates and apportions depreciation deductions of $250 against foreign source general limitation income and $150 against U.S. source income. On December 12, 2002, A sells the machine for $100 and recognizes a loss of $500. Because the machine was used predominantly outside the United States, under sections 865(c)(1)(B) and 865(c)(3)(B)(ii) gain on the disposition of the machine would be foreign source general limitation income to the extent of the depreciation adjustments. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the entire $500
loss is allocated against foreign source general limitation income.

# Example 2.
On January 1, 2002,
A,
a domestic corporation, loans $2,000 to
N,
its wholly-owned controlled foreign corporation, in exchange for a contingent payment debt instrument subject to § 1.1275-4(b). During 2002 through 2004,
A
accrues and receives interest income of $630, $150 of which is foreign source general limitation income and $480 of which is foreign source passive income under section 904(d)(3). Assume there are no positive or negative adjustments pursuant to § 1.1275-4(b)(6) in 2002 through 2004. On January 1, 2005,
A
disposes of the debt instrument and recognizes a $770 loss. Under § 1.1275-4(b)(8)(ii), $630 of the loss is treated as ordinary loss and $140 is treated as capital loss. Assume that $140 of interest income earned in 2005 with respect to the debt instrument would be foreign source passive income under section 904(d)(3). Under § 1.1275-4(b)(9)(iv), $150 of the ordinary loss is allocated against foreign source general limitation income and $480 of the ordinary loss is allocated against foreign source passive income. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $140 capital loss is allocated against foreign source passive income.

# Example 3.
(i) On January 1, 2003,
A,
a domestic corporation, purchases for $1,200 a taxable bond maturing on December 31, 2008, with a stated principal amount of $1,000, payable at maturity. The bond provides for unconditional payments of interest of $100, payable December 31 of each year. The issuer of the bond is a foreign corporation and interest on the bond is thus foreign source. Interest payments for 2003 and 2004 are timely made.
A
does not elect to amortize its bond premium under section 171 and the regulations thereunder, which would have permitted
A
to offset the $100 of interest income by $28.72 of bond premium in 2003, and by $30.42 in 2004. On January 1, 2005,
A
sells the bond and recognizes a $100 loss. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, $59.14 of the loss is allocated against foreign source income. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the remaining $40.86 of the loss is allocated against U.S. source income.
(ii) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 3,
except that
A
made the election to amortize its bond premium effective for taxable year 2004 (see § 1.171-4(c)). Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, $28.72 of the loss is allocated against foreign source income. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the remaining $71.28 of the loss is allocated against U.S. source income.

# Example 4.
On January 1, 2002,
A,
a domestic corporation, purchases for $1,000 a bond maturing December 31, 2014, with a stated principal amount of $1,000, payable at maturity. The bond provides for unconditional payments of interest of $100, payable December 31 of each year. The issuer of the bond is a foreign corporation and interest on the bond is thus foreign source. Between 2002 and 2006,
A
accrues and receives foreign source interest income of $500 with respect to the bond. On January 1, 2007,
A
sells the bond and recognizes a $500 loss. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the $500 loss is allocated against U.S. source income.

# Example 5.
On January 1, 2002,
A,
a domestic corporation on the accrual method of accounting, purchases for $1,000 a bond maturing December 31, 2012, with a stated principal amount of $1,000, payable at maturity. The bond provides for unconditional payments of interest of $100, payable December 31 of each year. The issuer of the bond is a foreign corporation and interest on the bond is thus foreign source. On June 10, 2002, after
A
has accrued $44 of interest income, but before any interest has been paid, the issuer suddenly becomes insolvent and declares bankruptcy.
A
sells the bond (including the accrued interest) for $20. Assuming that
A
properly accrued $44 of interest income,
A
treats the $20 proceeds from the sale of the bond as payment of interest previously accrued and recognizes a $1,000 loss with respect to the bond principal and a $24 loss with respect to the accrued interest. See § 1.61-7(d). Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the $1,000 loss with respect to the principal is allocated against U.S. source income. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the $24 loss with respect to accrued but unpaid interest is allocated against foreign source interest income.
(f)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, this section is applicable to loss recognized on or after January 8, 2002. For purposes of this paragraph (f), loss that is recognized but deferred (for example, under section 267 or 1092) shall be treated as recognized at the time the loss is taken into account.
(2)
Application to prior periods.
A taxpayer may apply the rules of this section to losses recognized in any taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1987, and all subsequent years, provided that—
(i) The taxpayer's tax liability as shown on an original or amended tax return is consistent with the rules of this section for each such year for which the statute of limitations does not preclude the filing of an amended return on June 30, 2002; and
(ii) The taxpayer makes appropriate adjustments to eliminate any double benefit arising from the application of this section to years that are not open for assessment.
(3)
Examples.
See § 1.865-2(e)(3) for examples illustrating an applicability date provision similar to the applicability date provided in this paragraph (f).
[T.D. 8973, 66 FR 67083, Dec. 28, 2001]
§ 1.865-2
Loss with respect to stock.
(a)
General rules for allocation of loss with respect to stock
—(1)
Allocation against gain.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, loss recognized with respect to stock shall be allocated to the class of gross income and, if necessary, apportioned between the statutory grouping of gross income (or among the statutory groupings) and the residual grouping of gross income, with respect to which gain (other than gain treated as a dividend under section 964(e)(1) or 1248) from a sale of such stock would give rise in the hands of the seller (without regard to section 865(f)). For purposes of this section, loss includes loss on property that is marked-to-market (such as under section 475) and subject to the rules of this section. Thus, for example, loss recognized by a United States resident on the sale of stock generally is allocated to reduce United States source income.
(2)
Stock attributable to foreign office.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, in the case of loss recognized by a United States resident with respect to stock that is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business in a foreign country within the meaning of section 865(e)(3), the loss shall be allocated to reduce foreign source income if a gain on the sale of the stock would have been taxable by the foreign country and the highest marginal rate of tax imposed on such gains in the foreign country is at least 10 percent.
(3)
Loss recognized by United States citizen or resident alien with foreign tax home
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, in the case of loss with respect to stock that is recognized by a United States citizen or resident alien that has a tax home (as defined in section 911(d)(3)) in a foreign country, the loss shall be allocated to reduce foreign source income if a gain on the sale of the stock would have been taxable by a foreign country and the highest marginal rate of tax imposed on such gains in the foreign country is at least 10 percent.
(ii)
Bona fide residents of Puerto Rico.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, in the case of loss with respect to stock in a corporation described in section 865(g)(3) recognized by a United States citizen or resident alien that is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico during the entire taxable year, the loss shall be allocated to reduce foreign source income. If gain from a sale of such stock would give rise to income exempt from tax under section 933, the loss with respect to such stock shall be allocated to amounts that are excluded from gross income under section 933(1) and therefore shall not be allowed as a deduction from gross income. See section 933(1) and § 1.933-1(c).
(4)
Stock constituting a United States real property interest.
Loss recognized by a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation with respect to stock that constitutes a United States real property interest shall be allocated to reduce United States source income. For additional rules governing the treatment of such loss, see section 897 and the regulations thereunder.
(5)
Allocation for purposes of section 904.
For purposes of section 904, loss recognized with respect to stock that is allocated to foreign source income under this paragraph (a) shall be allocated to the separate category under section 904(d) to which gain on a sale of the stock would have been assigned (without regard to section 904(d)(2)(A)(iii)(III)). For purposes of § 1.904-4(c)(2)(ii)(A), any such loss allocated to passive income shall be allocated (prior to the application of § 1.904-4(c)(2)(ii)(B)) to the group of passive income to which gain on a sale of the stock would have been assigned had a sale of the stock resulted in the recognition of a gain under the law of the relevant foreign jurisdiction or jurisdictions.
(b)
Exceptions
—(1)
Dividend recapture exception
—(i)
In general.
If a taxpayer recognizes a loss with respect to shares of stock, and the taxpayer (or a person described in section 1059(c)(3)(C) with
respect to such shares) included in income a dividend recapture amount (or amounts) with respect to such shares at any time during the recapture period, then, to the extent of the dividend recapture amount (or amounts), the loss shall be allocated and apportioned on a proportionate basis to the class or classes of gross income or the statutory or residual grouping or groupings of gross income to which the dividend recapture amount was assigned.
(ii)
Exception for de minimis amounts.
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall not apply to a loss recognized by a taxpayer on the disposition of stock if the sum of all dividend recapture amounts (other than dividend recapture amounts eligible for the exception described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section (passive limitation dividends)) included in income by the taxpayer (or a person described in section 1059(c)(3)(C)) with respect to such stock during the recapture period is less than 10 percent of the recognized loss.
(iii)
Exception for passive limitation dividends.
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall not apply to the extent of a dividend recapture amount that is treated as income in the separate category for passive income described in section 904(d)(2)(A) (without regard to section 904(d)(2)(A)(iii)(III)). The exception provided for in this paragraph (b)(1)(iii) shall not apply to any dividend recapture amount that is treated as income in the separate category for financial services income described in section 904(d)(2)(C).
(iv)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (b)(1) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i)
P,
a domestic corporation, is a United States shareholder of
N,
a controlled foreign corporation.
N
has never had any subpart F income and all of its earnings and profits are described in section 959(c)(3). On May 5, 1998,
N
distributes a dividend to
P
in the amount of $100. The dividend gives rise to a $5 foreign withholding tax, and
P
is deemed to have paid an additional $45 of foreign income tax with respect to the dividend under section 902. Under the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) the dividend is general limitation income described in section 904(d)(1)(I).
(ii) On February 6, 2000,
P
sells its shares of
N
and recognizes a $110 loss. In 2000,
P
has the following taxable income, excluding the loss on the sale of
N
:
(A) $1,000 of foreign source income that is general limitation income described in section 904(d)(1)(I);
(B) $1,000 of foreign source capital gain from the sale of stock in a foreign affiliate that is sourced under section 865(f) and is passive income described in section 904(d)(1)(A); and
(C) $1,000 of U.S. source income.
(iii) The $100 dividend paid in 1998 is a dividend recapture amount that was included in
P
's income within the recapture period preceding the disposition of the
N
stock. The
de minimis
exception of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply because the $100 dividend recapture amount exceeds 10 percent of the $110 loss. Therefore, to the extent of the $100 dividend recapture amount, the loss must be allocated under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section to the separate limitation category to which the dividend was assigned (general limitation income).
(iv)
P
's remaining $10 loss on the disposition of the
N
stock is allocated to U.S. source income under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(v) After allocation of the stock loss,
P
's foreign source taxable income in 2000 consists of $900 of foreign source general limitation income and $1,000 of foreign source passive income.

# Example 2.
(i)
P,
a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of
N1,
which owns all of the stock of
N2,
which owns all of the stock of
N3. N1, N2,
and
N3
are controlled foreign corporations. All of the corporations use the calendar year as their taxable year. On February 5, 1997,
N3
distributes a dividend to
N2.
The dividend is foreign personal holding company income of
N2
under section 954(c)(1)(A) that results in an inclusion of $100 in
P
's income under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) as of December 31, 1997. Under section 904(d)(3)(B) the inclusion is general limitation income described in section 904(d)(1)(I). The income inclusion to
P
results in a corresponding increase in
P
's basis in the stock of
N1
under section 961(a).
(ii) On March 5, 1999,
P
sells its shares of
N1
and recognizes a $110 loss. The $100 1997 subpart F inclusion is a dividend recapture amount that was included in
P
's income within the recapture period preceding the disposition of the
N1
stock. The de minimis exception of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply because the $100 dividend recapture amount exceeds 10 percent of the $110 loss. Therefore, to the extent of the $100 dividend recapture amount, the loss must be allocated under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section to the separate limitation category to which the dividend recapture amount was assigned (general limitation income). The remaining $10 loss is allocated to U.S. source income under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 3.
(i)
P,
a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of
N1,
which owns all of the stock of
N2. N1
and
N2
are controlled foreign corporations. All the corporations use the calendar year as their taxable year and the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. On May 5, 1998,
N2
pays a dividend of $100 to
N1
out of general limitation earnings and profits.
(ii) On February 5, 2000,
N1
sells its
N2
stock to an unrelated purchaser. The sale results in a loss to
N1
of $110 for U.S. tax purposes. In 2000,
N1
has the following current earnings and profits, excluding the loss on the sale of
N2
:
(A) $1,000 of non-subpart F foreign source general limitation earnings and profits described in section 904(d)(1)(I);
(B) $1,000 of foreign source gain from the sale of stock that is taken into account in determining foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1)(B)(i) and which is passive limitation earnings and profits described in section 904(d)(1)(A);
(C) $1,000 of foreign source interest income received from an unrelated person that is foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1)(A) and which is passive limitation earnings and profits described in section 904(d)(1)(A).
(iii) The $100 dividend paid in 1998 is a dividend recapture amount that was included in
N1
's income within the recapture period preceding the disposition of the
N2
stock. The
de minimis
exception of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply because the $100 dividend recapture amount exceeds 10 percent of the $110 loss. Therefore, to the extent of the $100 dividend recapture amount, the loss must be allocated under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section to the separate limitation category to which the dividend was assigned (general limitation earnings and profits).
(iv)
N1
's remaining $10 loss on the disposition of the
N2
stock is allocated to foreign source passive limitation earnings and profits under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(v) After allocation of the stock loss,
N1
's current earnings and profits for 1998 consist of $900 of foreign source general limitation earnings and profits and $1,990 of foreign source passive limitation earnings and profits.
(vi) After allocation of the stock loss,
N1
's subpart F income for 2000 consists of $1,000 of foreign source interest income that is foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1)(A) and $890 of foreign source net gain that is foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1)(B)(i).
P
includes $1,890 in income under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) as passive income under sections 904(d)(1)(A) and 904(d)(3)(B).

# Example 4.
P, a foreign corporation, has two wholly-owned subsidiaries,
S,
a domestic corporation, and
B,
a foreign corporation. On January 1, 2000,
S
purchases a one-percent interest in
N,
a foreign corporation, for $100. On January 2, 2000,
N
distributes a $20 dividend to
S.
The $20 dividend is foreign source financial services income. On January 3, 2000,
S
sells its
N
stock to
B
for $80 and recognizes a $20 loss that is deferred under section 267(f). On June 10, 2008,
B
sells its
N
stock to an unrelated person for $55. Under section 267(f) and § 1.267(f)-1(c)(1),
S
's $20 loss is deferred until 2008. Under this paragraph (b)(1), the $20 loss is allocated to reduce foreign source financial services income in 2008 because the loss was recognized (albeit deferred) within the 24-month recapture period following the receipt of the dividend. See §§ 1.267(f)-1(a)(2)(i)(B) and 1.267(f)-1(c)(2).

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4,
except
P, S,
and
B
are domestic corporations and members of the
P
consolidated group. Under the matching rule of § 1.1502-13(c)(1), the separate entity attributes of
S
's intercompany items and
B
's corresponding items are redetermined to the extent necessary to produce the same effect on consolidated taxable income as if
S
and
B
were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany transaction was a transaction between divisions. If
S
and
B
were divisions of a single corporation, the transfer of
N
stock on January 3, 2000 would be ignored for tax purposes, and the corporation would be treated as selling that stock only in 2008. Thus, the corporation's entire $45 loss would have been allocated against U.S. source income under paragraph (a)(1) of this section because a dividend recapture amount was not received during the corporation's recapture period. Accordingly,
S
's $20 loss and
B
's $25 loss are allocated to reduce U.S. source income.

# Example 6.
(i) On January 1, 1998,
P,
a domestic corporation, purchases
N,
a foreign corporation, for $1,000. On March 1, 1998,
P
causes
N
to sell its operating assets, distribute a $400 general limitation dividend to
P,
and invest its remaining $600 in short-term government securities.
P
converted the
N
assets into low-risk investments with a principal purpose of holding the
N
stock without significant risk of loss until the recapture period expired.
N
earns interest income from the securities. The income constitutes subpart F income that is included in
P
's income under section 951, increasing
P
's basis in the
N
stock under section 961(a). On March 1, 2002,
P
sells
N
and recognizes a $400 loss.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the recapture period is increased by the period in which
N
's assets were held as low-risk investments because
P
caused
N
's assets to be converted into and held as low-risk investments with a principal purpose of enabling
P
to hold the
N
stock without significant risk of loss. Accordingly, under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section the $400
loss is allocated against foreign source general limitation income.
(2)
Exception for inventory.
This section does not apply to loss recognized with respect to stock described in section 1221(1).
(3)
Exception for stock in an S corporation.
This section does not apply to loss recognized with respect to stock in an S corporation (as defined in section 1361).
(4)
Anti-abuse rules
—(i)
Transactions involving built-in losses.
If one of the principal purposes of a transaction is to change the allocation of a built-in loss with respect to stock by transferring the stock to another person, qualified business unit (within the meaning of section 989(a)), office or other fixed place of business, or branch that subsequently recognizes the loss, the loss shall be allocated by the transferee as if it were recognized with respect to the stock by the transferor immediately prior to the transaction. If one of the principal purposes of a change of residence is to change the allocation of a built-in loss with respect to stock, the loss shall be allocated as if the change of residence had not occurred. If one of the principal purposes of a transaction is to change the allocation of a built-in loss with respect to stock (or other personal property) by converting the original property into other property and subsequently recognizing loss with respect to such other property, the loss shall be allocated as if it were recognized with respect to the original property immediately prior to the transaction. Transactions subject to this paragraph shall include, without limitation, reorganizations within the meaning of section 368(a), liquidations under section 332, transfers to a corporation under section 351, transfers to a partnership under section 721, transfers to a trust, distributions by a partnership, distributions by a trust, or transfers to or from a qualified business unit, office or other fixed place of business. A person may have a principal purpose of affecting loss allocation even though this purpose is outweighed by other purposes (taken together or separately).
(ii)
Offsetting positions.
If a taxpayer recognizes loss with respect to stock and the taxpayer (or any person described in section 267(b) (after application of section 267(c)), 267(e), 318 or 482 with respect to the taxpayer) holds (or held) offsetting positions with respect to such stock with a principal purpose of recognizing foreign source income and United States source loss, the loss will be allocated and apportioned against such foreign source income. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), positions are offsetting if the risk of loss of holding one or more positions is substantially diminished by holding one or more other positions.
(iii)
Matching rule.
If a taxpayer (or a person described in section 1059(c)(3)(C) with respect to the taxpayer) engages in a transaction or series of transactions with a principal purpose of recognizing foreign source income that results in the creation of a corresponding loss with respect to stock (as a consequence of the rules regarding the timing of recognition of income, for example), the loss shall be allocated and apportioned against such income to the extent of the recognized foreign source income. This paragraph (b)(4)(iii) applies to any portion of a loss that is not allocated under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (dividend recapture rule), including a loss in excess of the dividend recapture amount and a loss that is related to a dividend recapture amount described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) (de minimis exception) or (b)(1)(iii) (passive dividend exception) of this section.
(iv)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (b)(4) may be illustrated by the following examples. No inference is intended regarding the application of any other Internal Revenue Code section or judicial doctrine that may apply to disallow or defer the recognition of loss. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 2000,
P,
a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of
N1,
a controlled foreign corporation, which owns all of the stock of
N2,
a controlled foreign corporation.
N1
's basis in the stock of
N2
exceeds its fair market value, and any loss recognized by
N1
on the sale of
N2
would be allocated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to reduce foreign source passive limitation earnings and profits of
N1.
In contemplation of the sale of
N2
to an unrelated purchaser,
P
causes
N1
to liquidate with principal purposes of recognizing the
loss on the
N2
stock and allocating the loss against U.S. source income.
P
sells the
N2
stock and
P
recognizes a loss.
(ii)
Loss allocation.
Because one of the principal purposes of the liquidation was to transfer the stock to
P
in order to change the allocation of the built-in loss on the
N2
stock, under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section the loss is allocated against
P
's foreign source passive limitation income.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 2000,
P,
a domestic corporation, forms
N
and
F,
foreign corporations, and contributes $1,000 to the capital of each.
N
and
F
enter into offsetting positions in financial instruments that produce financial services income. Holding the
N
stock substantially diminishes
P
's risk of loss with respect to the
F
stock (and vice versa).
P
holds
N
and
F
with a principal purpose of recognizing foreign source income and U.S. source loss. On March 31, 2000, when the financial instrument held by
N
is worth $1,200 and the financial instrument held by
F
is worth $800,
P
sells its
F
stock and recognizes a $200 loss.
(ii)
Loss allocation.
Because
P
held an offsetting position with respect to the
F
stock with a principal purpose of recognizing foreign source income and U.S. source loss, the $200 loss is allocated against foreign source financial services income under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 2002,
P
and
Q,
domestic corporations, form
R,
a domestic partnership. The corporations and partnership use the calendar year as their taxable year.
P
contributes $900 to
R
in exchange for a 90-percent partnership interest and
Q
contributes $100 to
R
in exchange for a 10-percent partnership interest.
R
purchases a dance studio in Country
X
for $1,000. On January 2, 2002,
R
enters into contracts to provide dance lessons in Country
X
for a 5-year period beginning January 1, 2003. These contracts are prepaid by the dance studio customers on December 31, 2002, and
R
recognizes foreign source taxable income of $500 from the prepayments (
R
's only income in 2002).
P
takes into income its $450 distributive share of partnership taxable income. On January 1, 2003,
P
's basis in its partnership interest is $1,350 ($900 from its contribution under section 722, increased by its $450 distributive share of partnership income under section 705). On September 22, 2003,
P
contributes its
R
partnership interest to
S,
a newly-formed domestic corporation, in exchange for all the stock of
S.
Under section 358,
P
's basis in
S
is $1,350. On December 1, 2003,
P
sells
S
to an unrelated party for $1050 and recognizes a $300 loss.
(ii)
Loss allocation. P
recognized foreign source income for tax purposes before the income had economically accrued, and the accelerated recognition of income increased
P
's basis in
R
without increasing its value by a corresponding amount, which resulted in the creation of a built-in loss with respect to the
S
stock. Under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section the $300 loss is allocated against foreign source income if
P
had a principal purpose of recognizing foreign source income and corresponding loss.
(c)
Loss recognized by partnership.
A partner's distributive share of loss recognized by a partnership shall be allocated and apportioned in accordance with this section as if the partner had recognized the loss. If loss is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business of the partnership within the meaning of section 865(e)(3), such office or fixed place of business shall be considered to be an office of the partner for purposes of this section.
(d)
Definitions
—(1)
Terms defined in § 1.861-8.
See § 1.861-8 for the meaning of
class of gross income, statutory grouping of gross income,
and
residual grouping of gross income.
(2)
Dividend recapture amount.
A dividend recapture amount is a dividend (except for an amount treated as a dividend under section 78), an inclusion described in section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) (but only to the extent attributable to a dividend (including a dividend under section 964(e)(1)) included in the earnings of a controlled foreign corporation (held directly or indirectly by the person recognizing the loss) that is included in foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1)(A)) and an inclusion described in section 951(a)(1)(B).
(3)
Recapture period.
A recapture period is the 24-month period ending on the date on which a taxpayer recognized a loss with respect to stock. For example, if a taxpayer recognizes a loss on March 15, 2002, the recapture period begins on and includes March 16, 2000, and ends on and includes March 15, 2002. A recapture period is increased by any period of time in which the taxpayer has diminished its risk of loss in a manner described in section 246(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder and by any period in which the assets of the corporation are hedged against risk of loss (or are converted into and held as low-risk investments) with a principal purpose of enabling the taxpayer to hold the stock without significant risk of loss until the recapture period has expired. In the case of a loss recognized
after a dividend is declared but before such dividend is paid, the recapture period is extended through the date on which the dividend is paid.
(4)
United States resident.
See section 865(g) and the regulations thereunder for the definition of United States resident.
(e)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
This section is applicable to loss recognized on or after January 11, 1999, except that paragraphs (a)(3)(ii), (b)(1)(iv)
Example 6,
(b)(4)(iii), (b)(4)(iv)
Example 3,
and (d)(3) of this section are applicable to loss recognized on or after January 8, 2002. For purposes of this paragraph (e), loss that is recognized but deferred (for example, under section 267 or 1092) shall be treated as recognized at the time the loss is taken into account.
(2)
Application to prior periods.
A taxpayer may apply the rules of this section to losses recognized in any taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1987, and all subsequent years, provided that—
(i) The taxpayer's tax liability as shown on an original or amended tax return is consistent with the rules of this section for each such year for which the statute of limitations does not preclude the filing of an amended return on June 30, 2002; and
(ii) The taxpayer makes appropriate adjustments to eliminate any double benefit arising from the application of this section to years that are not open for assessment.
(3)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i)
P,
a domestic corporation, has a calendar taxable year. On March 10, 1985,
P
recognizes a $100 capital loss on the sale of
N,
a foreign corporation. Pursuant to sections 1211(a) and 1212(a), the loss is not allowed in 1985 and is carried over to the 1990 taxable year. The loss is allocated against foreign source income under § 1.861-8(e)(7). In 1999,
P
chooses to apply this section to all losses recognized in its 1987 taxable year and in all subsequent years.
(ii) Allocation of the loss on the sale of
N
is not affected by the rules of this section because the loss was recognized in a taxable year that did not begin after December 31, 1986.

# Example 2.
(i)
P,
a domestic corporation, has a calendar taxable year. On March 10, 1988,
P
recognizes a $100 capital loss on the sale of
N,
a foreign corporation. Pursuant to sections 1211(a) and 1212(a), the loss is not allowed in 1988 and is carried back to the 1985 taxable year. The loss is allocated against foreign source income under § 1.861-8(e)(7) on
P
's federal income tax return for 1985 and increases an overall foreign loss account under § 1.904(f)-1.
(ii) In 1999,
P
chooses to apply this section to all losses recognized in its 1987 taxable year and in all subsequent years. Consequently, the loss on the sale of
N
is allocated against U.S. source income under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Allocation of the loss against U.S. source income reduces
P's
overall foreign loss account and increases
P's
tax liability in 2 years: 1990, a year that will not be open for assessment on June 30, 1999, and 1997, a year that will be open for assessment on June 30, 1999. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section,
P
must file an amended federal income tax return that reflects the rules of this section for 1997, but not for 1990.

# Example 3.
(i)
P,
a domestic corporation, has a calendar taxable year. On March 10, 1989,
P
recognizes a $100 capital loss on the sale of
N,
a foreign corporation. The loss is allocated against foreign source income under § 1.861-8(e)(7) on
P's
federal income tax return for 1989 and results in excess foreign tax credits for that year. The excess credit is carried back to 1988, pursuant to section 904(c). In 1999,
P
chooses to apply this section to all losses recognized in its 1989 taxable year and in all subsequent years. On June 30, 1999,
P's
1988 taxable year is closed for assessment, but
P's
1989 taxable year is open with respect to claims for refund.
(ii) Because
P
chooses to apply this section to its 1989 taxable year, the loss on the sale of
N
is allocated against U.S. source income under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Allocation of the loss against U.S. source income would have permitted the foreign tax credit to be used in 1989, reducing
P's
tax liability in 1989. Nevertheless, under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, because the credit was carried back to 1988,
P
may not claim the foreign tax credit in 1989.
[T.D. 8805, 64 FR 1511, Jan. 11, 1999, as amended by T.D. 8973, 66 FR 67085, Dec. 28, 2001; 67 FR 3812, Jan. 28, 2002]
§ 1.865-3
Source of gross income from sales of personal property (including inventory property) by a nonresident attributable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States.
(a)
In general.
Notwithstanding any provision of section 861 through 865 or other regulations in this part, this section provides the sole sourcing rules for gross income, gain, or loss from section 865(e)(2) sales. Gross income, gain,
or loss from a section 865(e)(2) sale is U.S. source income to the extent that the gross income, gain, or loss is properly allocable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States under paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Exception for certain inventory sales for use, disposition or consumption outside the United States.
A section 865(e)(2) sale does not include any sale of inventory property that is sold for use, disposition, or consumption outside the United States if an office or other fixed place of business of the nonresident in a foreign country materially participates in the sale. See § 1.864-6(b)(3) to determine whether a foreign office materially participates in the sale and whether the property was destined for foreign use.
(c)
Section 865(e)(2) sales.
For purposes of this section, a “section 865(e)(2) sale” is a sale of personal property by a nonresident, including inventory property, other than a sale described in paragraph (b) of this section, that is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States under the principles of section 864(c)(5)(B) as prescribed in § 1.864-6(b)(1) and (2). In determining whether a nonresident maintains an office or other fixed place of business in the United States, the principles of section 864(c)(5)(A) as prescribed in § 1.864-7 apply, including the rules of paragraph (d) of that section regarding the office or other fixed place of business of a dependent agent of the nonresident. For purposes of this section, “inventory property” has the meaning provided in section 865(i)(1), and “nonresident” has the meaning provided in section 865(g)(1)(B).
(d)
Amount of gross income, gain, or loss on sale of personal property properly allocable to a U.S. office
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(2) through (4) of this section, the amount of gross income, gain, or loss from a section 865(e)(2) sale that is properly allocable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States is determined under the principles of § 1.864-6(c)(1).
(2)
Produced inventory property.
Gross income, gain, or loss from a section 865(e)(2) sale of inventory property that is produced by the nonresident seller is properly allocable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States or to production activities in accordance with the “50/50 method” described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. However, in lieu of the 50/50 method, the nonresident seller may elect to allocate the gross income, gain, or loss under the “books and records method” described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, provided that the nonresident satisfies all of the requirements described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section to the satisfaction of the Commissioner. Gross income allocable to production activities under this paragraph (d)(2) is sourced in accordance with § 1.863-3. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), the term “produced” includes created, fabricated, manufactured, extracted, processed, cured, and aged, as determined under the principles of § 1.954-3(a)(4) (except for § 1.954-3(a)(4)(iv)). See section 864(a) and § 1.864-1.
(i)
The 50/50 method.
Fifty percent of the gross income, gain, or loss from a section 865(e)(2) sale of inventory property that is produced by the nonresident seller is properly allocable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States, and the remaining 50 percent of the gross income, gain, or loss is properly allocable to production activities (the “50/50 method”).
(ii)
Books and records method
—(A)
Method.
Subject to paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, a nonresident may elect to determine the amount of its gross income, gain, or loss from the sale of inventory property produced by the nonresident seller that is properly allocable to production activities and sales activities for the taxable year based upon its books of account (the “books and records method”). The gross income, gain, or loss allocable to sales activities under this method is treated as properly allocable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States and the remaining gross income, gain, or loss is treated as properly allocable to production activities.
(B)
Election and reporting rules
—(
1
)
In general.
A nonresident may not make the election described in paragraph
(d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section unless the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) through (
4
) of this section are satisfied. Once the election is made, the nonresident must continue to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) through (
4
) of this section until the election is revoked. If the nonresident fails to satisfy the requirements in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) through (
4
) of this section to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, the Commissioner may, in its sole discretion, apply the 50/50 method described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
(
2
)
Books of account.
The nonresident must establish that it, in good faith and unaffected by considerations of tax liability, regularly employs in its books of account a detailed allocation of receipts and expenditures that, under the principles of section 482, clearly reflects both the amount of the nonresident's gross income, gain, or loss from its inventory sales that are attributable to its sales activities, and the amount of its gross income, gain, or loss from its inventory sales that are attributable to its production activities. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
), section 482 principles apply as if the office or other fixed place of business in the United States were a separate organization, trade, or business (and, thus, a separate controlled taxpayer) from the nonresident (whether or not payments are made between the United States office or other fixed place of business and the nonresident's other offices, and whether or not the nonresident itself would otherwise constitute an organization, trade, or business).
(
3
)
Required records.
The nonresident must prepare and maintain the records described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, which must be in existence when its return is filed. The nonresident must also prepare an explanation of how the allocation clearly reflects the nonresident's gross income, gain, or loss from production and sales activities under the principles of section 482. The nonresident must make available the explanation and records of the nonresident (including for the office or other fixed place of business in the United States and the offices or branches that perform the production activities) upon request of the Commissioner, within 30 days, unless some other period is agreed upon between the Commissioner and the nonresident.
(
4
)
Making and revoking the books and records method election; disclosure of election.
Except as otherwise provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, a nonresident makes or revokes the election to apply the books and records method by attaching a statement to its original timely filed Federal income tax return (including extensions) providing that it elects, or revokes the election, to apply the books and records method described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. For nonresidents making the election, the statement must provide that the nonresident has prepared the records described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section.
(
5
)
Limitation on revoking the books and records method election.
Once made, the books and records method election continues until revoked. An election cannot be revoked, without the consent of the Commissioner, for any taxable year beginning within 48 months of the last day of the taxable year for which the election was made.
(3)
Purchased inventory property.
All gross income, gain, or loss from a section 865(e)(2) sale of inventory property that is both purchased and sold by a nonresident is properly allocable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States.
(4)
Depreciable personal property.
Gain from a section 865(e)(2) sale of depreciable personal property (as defined in section 865(c)(4)) is allocated under paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) The gain not in excess of the depreciation adjustments, if any, is properly allocable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States to the same extent that the gain would be allocated to sources within the United States under the rules of section 865(c)(1). The remaining gain not in excess of the depreciation adjustments, if any, is allocated to sources without the United States in accordance with section 865(c)(1). However, notwithstanding the preceding
sentences, if the property was predominantly used in the United States, within the meaning of section 865(c)(3)(B)(i), for a particular taxable year, all of the gain not in excess of depreciation for that year is properly allocable to the office or other fixed place of business in the United States.
(ii) The gain in excess of the depreciation adjustments, if any, is treated as if such gain was from the sale of inventory and the amount allocable to an office or fixed place of business in the United States is determined under paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section, as applicable.
(e)
Determination of source of taxable income.
For rules allocating and apportioning expenses to gross income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of a foreign corporation in the United States (including gross income, gain, or loss sourced under this section), see section 882(c)(1). For rules allocating and apportioning expenses to gross income, gain, or loss effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of a nonresident alien in the United States (including gross income, gain, or loss sourced under this section), see section 873(a).
(f)
Export trade corporations.
This section does not apply for purposes of defining an export trade corporation under section 971(a).
(g)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years ending on or after December 23, 2019. However, a nonresident may apply this section in its entirety for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending before December 23, 2019, provided that the nonresident and all persons related to the nonresident (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) apply this section and §§ 1.863-1(b), 1.863-2(b), 1.863-3, 1.863-8(b)(3)(ii), 1.864-5(a) and (b), and 1.864-6(c)(2) in their entirety for the taxable year, and once applied, the nonresident and all persons related to the nonresident (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) continue to apply these regulations in their entirety for all subsequent taxable years.

# Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations

# nonresident alien individuals
§ 1.871-1
Classification and manner of taxing alien individuals.
(a)
Classes of aliens.
For purposes of the income tax, alien individuals are divided generally into two classes, namely, resident aliens and nonresident aliens. Resident alien individuals are, in general, taxable the same as citizens of the United States; that is, a resident alien is taxable on income derived from all sources, including sources without the United States. See § 1.1-1(b). Nonresident alien individuals are taxable only on certain income from sources within the United States and on the income described in section 864(c)(4) from sources without the United States which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. However, nonresident alien individuals may elect, under section 6013 (g) or (h), to be treated as U.S. residents for purposes of determining their income tax liability under Chapters 1 and 24 of the code. Accordingly, any reference in §§ 1.1-1 through 1.1388-1 to non-resident alien individuals does not include those with respect to whom an election under section 6013 (g) or (h) is in effect, unless otherwise specifically provided. Similarly, any reference to resident aliens or U.S. residents includes those with respect to whom an election is in effect, unless otherwise specifically provided.
(b)
Classes of nonresident aliens
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of the income tax, nonresident alien individuals are divided into the following three classes:
(i) Nonresident alien individuals who at no time during the taxable year are engaged in a trade or business in the United States,
(ii) Nonresident alien individuals who at any time during the taxable year are, or are deemed under § 1.871-9 to be, engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and
(iii) Nonresident alien individuals who are bona fide residents of a section 931 possession (as defined in § 1.931-1(c)(1) of this chapter) or Puerto Rico
during the entire taxable year. An individual described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section is subject to tax pursuant to the provisions of subpart A (section 871 and following), part II, subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations under those provisions. The provisions of subpart A do not apply to individuals described in this paragraph (b)(1)(iii), but such individuals, except as provided in section 931 or 933, are subject to the tax imposed by section 1 or 55. See § 1.876-1.
(2)
Treaty income.
If the gross income of a nonresident alien individual described in subparagraph (1) (i) or (ii) of this paragraph includes income on which the tax is limited by tax convention, see § 1.871-12.
(3)
Exclusions from gross income.
For rules relating to the exclusion of certain items from the gross income of a nonresident alien individual, including annuities excluded under section 871(f), see §§ 1.872-2 and 1.894-1.
(4)
Expatriation to avoid tax.
For special rules applicable in determining the tax of a nonresident alien individual who has lost U.S. citizenship with a principal purpose of avoiding certain taxes, see section 877.
(5)
Adjustment of tax of certain nonresident aliens.
For the application of pre-1967 income tax provisions to residents of a foreign country which imposes a more burdensome income tax than the United States, and for the adjustment of the income tax of a national or resident of a foreign country which imposes a discriminatory income tax on the income of citizens of the United States or domestic corporations, see section 896.
(6)
Conduit financing arrangements.
For rules regarding conduit financing arrangements, see §§ 1.881-3 and 1.881-4.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
This section shall apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966. For corresponding rules applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see 26 CFR 1.871-1 and 1.871-7(a) (Revised as of January 1, 1971). Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies to taxable years ending after April 9, 2008.
[T.D. 7332, 39 FR 44218, Dec. 23, 1974, as amended by T.D. 7670, 45 FR 6928, Jan. 31, 1980; T.D. 8611, 60 FR 41004, Aug. 11, 1995; T.D. 9194, 70 FR 18928, Apr. 11, 2005; T.D. 9391, 73 FR 19358, Apr. 9, 2008; T.D. 9849, 84 FR 9236, Mar. 14, 2019]
§ 1.871-2
Determining residence of alien individuals.
(a)
General.
The term
nonresident alien individual
means an individual whose residence is not within the United States, and who is not a citizen of the United States. The term includes a nonresident alien fiduciary. For such purpose the term fiduciary shall have the meaning assigned to it by section 7701(a)(6) and the regulations in part 301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration). For presumption as to an alien's nonresidence, see paragraph (b) of § 1.871-4.
(b)
Residence defined.
An alien actually present in the United States who is not a mere transient or sojourner is a resident of the United States for purposes of the income tax. Whether he is a transient is determined by his intentions with regard to the length and nature of his stay. A mere floating intention, indefinite as to time, to return to another country is not sufficient to constitute him a transient. If he lives in the United States and has no definite intention as to his stay, he is a resident. One who comes to the United States for a definite purpose which in its nature may be promptly accomplished is a transient; but, if his purpose is of such a nature that an extended stay may be necessary for its accomplishment, and to that end the alien makes his home temporarily in the United States, he becomes a resident, though it may be his intention at all times to return to his domicile abroad when the purpose for which he came has been consummated or abandoned. An alien whose stay in the United States is limited to a definite period by the immigration laws is not a resident of the United States within the meaning of this section, in the absence of exceptional circumstances.
(c)
Application and effective dates.
Unless the context indicates otherwise,
§§ 1.871-2 through 1.871-5 apply to determine the residence of aliens for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1985. To determine the residence of aliens for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984, see section 7701(b) and §§ 301.7701(b)-1 through 301.7701(b)-9 of this chapter. However, for purposes of determining whether an individual is a qualified individual under section 911(d)(1)(A), the rules of §§ 1.871-2 and 1.871-5 shall continue to apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984. For purposes of determining whether an individual is a resident of the United States for estate and gift tax purposes, see § 20.0-1(b)(1) and (2) and § 25.2501-1(b) of this chapter, respectively.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8411, 57 FR 15241, Apr. 27, 1992]
§ 1.871-3
Residence of alien seamen.
In order to determine whether an alien seaman is a resident of the United States for purposes of the income tax, it is necessary to decide whether the presumption of nonresidence (as prescribed by paragraph (b) of § 1.871-4) is overcome by facts showing that he has established a residence in the United States. Residence may be established on a vessel regularly engaged in coastwise trade, but the mere fact that a sailor makes his home on a vessel which is flying the United States flag and is engaged in foreign trade is not sufficient to establish residence in the United States, even though the vessel, while carrying on foreign trade, touches at American ports. An alien seaman may acquire an actual residence in the United States within the rules laid down in § 1.871-4, although the nature of his calling requires him to be absent for a long period from the place where his residence is established. An alien seaman may acquire such a residence at a sailors' boarding house or hotel, but such a claim should be carefully scrutinized in order to make sure that such residence is bona fide. The filing of Form 1078 or taking out first citizenship papers is proof of residence in the United States from the time the form is filed or the papers taken out, unless rebutted by other evidence showing an intention to be a transient.
§ 1.871-4
Proof of residence of aliens.
(a)
Rules of evidence.
The following rules of evidence shall govern in determining whether or not an alien within the United States has acquired residence therein for purposes of the income tax.
(b)
Nonresidence presumed.
An alien by reason of his alienage, is presumed to be a nonresident alien.
(c)
Presumption rebutted
—(1)
Departing alien.
In the case of an alien who presents himself for determination of tax liability before departure from the United States, the presumption as to the alien's nonresidence may be overcome by proof—
(i) That the alien, at least six months before the date he so presents himself, has filed a declaration of his intention to become a citizen of the United States under the naturalization laws; or
(ii) That the alien, at least six months before the date he so presents himself, has filed Form 1078 or its equivalent; or
(iii) Of acts and statements of the alien showing a definite intention to acquire residence in the United States or showing that his stay in the United States has been of such an extended nature as to constitute him a resident.
(2)
Other aliens.
In the case of other aliens, the presumption as to the alien's nonresidence may be overcome by proof—
(i) That the alien has filed a declaration of his intention to become a citizen of the United States under the naturalization laws; or
(ii) That the alien has filed Form 1078 or its equivalent; or
(iii) Of acts and statements of the alien showing a definite intention to acquire residence in the United States or showing that his stay in the United States has been of such an extended nature as to constitute him a resident.
(d)
Certificate.
If, in the application of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) or (2)(iii) of this section, the internal revenue officer or employee who examines the alien is in doubt as to the facts, such officer or employee may, to assist him in determining the facts, require a certificate
or certificates setting forth the facts relied upon by the alien seeking to overcome the presumption. Each such certificate, which shall contain, or be verified by, a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, shall be executed by some credible person or persons, other than the alien and members of his family, who have known the alien at least six months before the date of execution of the certificate or certificates.
§ 1.871-5
Loss of residence by an alien.
An alien who has acquired residence in the United States retains his status as a resident until he abandons the same and actually departs from the United States. An intention to change his residence does not change his status as a resident alien to that of a nonresident alien. Thus, an alien who has acquired a residence in the United States is taxable as a resident for the remainder of his stay in the United States.
§ 1.871-6
Duty of withholding agent to determine status of alien payees.
For the obligation of a withholding agent to withhold the tax imposed by this section, see chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.

§ 1.871-7
Taxation of nonresident alien individuals not engaged in U.S. business.
(a)
Imposition of tax.
(1) This section applies for purposes of determining the tax of a nonresident alien individual who at no time during the taxable year is engaged in trade or business in the United States. However, see also § 1.871-8 where such individual is a student or trainee deemed to be engaged in trade or business in the United States or where he has an election in effect for the taxable year in respect to real property income. Except as otherwise provided in § 1.871-12, a nonresident alien individual to whom this section applies is not subject to the tax imposed by section 1 or section 1201(b) but, pursuant to the provision of section 871(a), is liable to a flat tax of 30 percent upon the aggregate of the amounts determined under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section which are received during the taxable year from sources within the United States. Except as specifically provided in such paragraphs, such amounts do not include gains from the sale or exchange of property. To determine the source of such amounts, see sections 861 through 863, and the regulations thereunder.
(2) The tax of 30 percent is imposed by section 871(a) upon an amount only to the extent the amount constitutes gross income. Thus, for example, the amount of an annuity which is subject to such tax shall be determined in accordance with section 72.
(3) Deductions shall not be allowed in determining the amount subject to tax under this section except that losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed to the extent provided in section 871(a)(2) and paragraph (d) of this section.
(4) Except as provided in §§ 1.871-9 and 1.871-10, a nonresident alien individual not engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year has no income, gain, or loss for the taxable year which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. See section 864(c)(1)(B) and § 1.864-3.
(5) Gains and losses which, by reason of section 871(d) and § 1.871-10, are treated as gains or losses which are effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the nonresident alien individual shall not be taken into account in determining the tax under this section. See, for example, paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.871-10.
(6) For special rules applicable in determining the tax of certain nonresident alien individuals, see paragraph (b) of § 1.871-1.
(b)
Fixed or determinable annual or periodical income
—(1)
General rule.
The tax of 30 percent imposed by section 871(a)(1) applies to the gross amount received from sources within the United States as fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income. Specific items of fixed or determinable annual or periodical income are enumerated in section 871(a)(1)(A) as interest, dividends, rents, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, compensations,
remunerations, and emoluments, but other items of fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income are also subject to the tax, as, for instance, royalties, including royalties for the use of patents, copyrights, secret processes and formulas, and other like property. As to the determination of fixed or determinable annual or periodical income see § 1.1441-2(b). For special rules treating gain on the disposition of section 306 stock as fixed or determinable annual or periodical income for purposes of section 871(a), see section 306(f) and paragraph (h) of § 1.306-3.
(2)
Substitute payments.
For purposes of this section, a substitute interest payment (as defined in § 1.861-2(a)(7)) received by a foreign person pursuant to a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction (as defined in § 1.861-2(a)(7)) shall have the same character as interest income paid or accrued with respect to the terms of the transferred security. Similarly, for purposes of this section, a substitute dividend payment (as defined in § 1.861-3(a)(6)) received by a foreign person pursuant to a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction (as defined in § 1.861-3(a)(6)) shall have the same character as a distribution received with respect to the transferred security. Where, pursuant to a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction, a foreign person transfers to another person a security the interest on which would qualify as portfolio interest under section 871(h) in the hands of the lender, substitute interest payments made with respect to the transferred security will be treated as portfolio interest, provided that in the case of interest on an obligation in registered form (as defined in § 1.871-14(c)(1)(i)), the transferor complies with the documentation requirement described in § 1.871-14(c)(1)(ii)(C) with respect to the payment of the substitute interest and none of the exceptions to the portfolio interest exemption in sections 871(h) (3) and (4) apply. See also §§ 1.861-2(b)(2) and 1.894-1(c).
(c)
Other income and gains
—(1)
Items subject to tax.
The tax of 30 percent imposed by section 871(a)(1) also applies to the following gains received during the taxable year from sources within the United States:
(i) Gains described in section 402(a)(2), relating to the treatment of total distributions from certain employees' trusts; section 403(a)(2), relating to treatment of certain payments under certain employee annuity plans; and section 631 (b) or (c), relating to treatment of gain on the disposal of timber, coal, or iron ore with a retained economic interest;
(ii) [Reserved]
(iii) Gains on transfers described in section 1235, relating to certain transfers of patent rights, made on or before October 4, 1966; and
(iv) Gains from the sale or exchange after October 4, 1966, of patents, copyrights, secret processes and formulas, good will, trademarks, trade brands, franchises, or other like property, or of any interest in any such property, to the extent the gains are from payments (whether in a lump sum or in installments) which are contingent on the productivity, use or disposition of the property or interest sold or exchanged, or from payments which are treated under section 871(e) and § 1.871-11 as being so contingent.
(2)
Nonapplication of 183-day rule.
The provisions of section 871(a)(2), relating to gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets, and paragraph (d)(2) of this section do not apply to the gains described in this paragraph; as a consequence, the taxpayer receiving gains described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph during a taxable year is subject to the tax of 30 percent thereon without regard to the 183-day rule contained in such provisions.
(3)
Determination of amount of gain.
The tax of 30 percent imposed upon the gains described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies to the full amount of the gains and is determined (i) without regard to the alternative tax imposed by section 1201(b) upon the excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss; (ii) without regard to the deduction allowed by section 1202 in respect of capital gains; (iii) without regard to section 1231, relating to property used in the trade or business and involuntary conversions; and (iv), except in
the case of gains described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, whether or not the gains are considered to be gains from the sale or exchange of property which is a capital asset.
(d)
Gains from sale or exchange of capital assets
—(1)
Gains subject to tax.
The tax of 30 percent imposed by section 871(a)(2) applies to the excess of gains derived from sources within the United States over losses allocable to sources within the United States, which are derived from the sale or exchange of capital assets, determined in accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (2) through (4) of this paragraph.
(2)
Presence in the United States 183 days or more.
(i) If the nonresident alien individual has been present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the taxable year, he is liable to a tax of 30 percent upon the amount by which his gains, derived from sources within the United States, from sales or exchanges of capital assets effected at any time during the year exceed his losses, allocable to sources within the United States, from sales or exchanges of capital assets effected at any time during that year. Gains and losses from sales or exchanges effected at any time during such taxable year are to be taken into account for this purpose even though the nonresident alien individual is not present in the United States at the time the sales or exchanges are effected. In addition, if the nonresident alien individual has been present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the taxable year, gains and losses for such taxable year from sales or exchanges of capital assets effected during a previous taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, are to be taken into account, but only if he was also present in the United States during such previous taxable year for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more.
(ii) If the nonresident alien individual has not been present in the United States during the taxable year, or if he has been present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating less than 183 days during the taxable year, gains and losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets effected during the year are not to be taken into account, except as required by paragraph (c) of this section, in determining the tax of such individual even though the sales or exchanges are effected during his presence in the United States. Moreover, gains and losses for such taxable year from sales or exchanges of capital assets effected during a previous taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, are not to be taken into account, even though the nonresident alien individual was present in the United States during such previous year for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more.
(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, a nonresident alien individual is not considered to be present in the United States by reason of the presence in the United States of a person who is an agent or partner of such individual or who is a fiduciary of an estate or trust of which such individual is a beneficiary or a grantor-owner to whom section 671 applies.
(iv) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
B, a nonresident alien individual not engaged in trade or business in the United States and using the calendar year as the taxable year, is present in the United States from May 1, 1971, to November 15, 1971, a period of more than 182 days. While present in the United States, B effects for his own account on various dates a number of transactions in stocks and securities on the stock exchange, as a result of which he has recognized capital gains of $10,000. During the period from January 1, 1971, to April 30, 1971, he carries out similar transactions through an agent in the United States, as a result of which B has recognized capital gains of $5,000. On December 15, 1971, through an agent in the United States B sells a capital asset on the installment plan, no payments being made by the purchaser in 1971. During 1972, B receives installment payments of $50,000 on the installment sale made in 1971, and the capital gain from sources within the United States for 1972 attributable to such payments is $12,500. In addition, during the period from January 1, 1972, to May 31, 1972, B effects for his own account, through an agent in the United States, a number of transactions in stocks and securities on the stock exchange, as a result of which B has recognized capital gains of $20,000. At no time during 1972 is B present in the United States or engaged in trade or business in the United States. Accordingly,
for 1971, B is subject to tax under section 871(a)(2) on his capital gains of $15,000 from the transactions in that year on the stock exchange. For 1972, B is not subject to tax on the capital gain of $12,500 from the installment sale in 1971 or on the capital gains of $20,000 from the transactions in 1972 on the stock exchange.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that B is present in the United States from June 15, 1972, to December 31, 1972, a period of more than 182 days. Accordingly, B is subject to tax under section 871(a)(2) for 1971 on his capital gains of $15,000 from the transactions in that year on the stock exchange. He is also subject to tax under section 871(a)(2) for 1972 on his capital gains of $32,500 ($12,500 from the installment sale in 1971 plus $20,000 from the transactions in 1972 on the stock exchange).

# Example 3.
D, a nonresident alien individual not engaged in trade or business in the United States and using the calendar year as the taxable year, is present in the United States from April 1, 1971, to August 31, 1971, a period of less than 183 days. While present in the United States, D effects for his own account on various dates a number of transactions in stocks and securities on the stock exchange, as a result of which he has recognized capital gains of $15,000. During the period from January 1, 1971, to March 31, 1971, he carries out similar transactions through an agent in the United States, as a result of which D has recognized capital gains of $8,000. On December 20, 1971, through an agent in the United States D sells a capital asset on the installment plan, no payments being made by the purchaser in 1971. During 1972, D receives installment payments of $200,000 on the installment sale made in 1971, and the capital gain from sources within the United States for 1972 attributable to such payments is $50,000. In addition, during the period from February 1, 1972, to August 15, 1972, a period of more than 182 days. D effects for his own account, through an agent in the United States, a number of transactions in stocks and securities on the stock exchange, as a result of which D has recognized capital gains of $25,000. At no time during 1972 is D present in the United States or engaged in trade or business in the United States. Accordingly, D is not subject to tax for 1971 or 1972 on any of his recognized capital gains.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in example 3 except that D is present in the United States from February 1, 1972, to August 15, 1972, a period of more than 182 days. Accordingly, D is not subject to tax for 1971 on his capital gains of $23,000 from the transactions in that year on the stock exchange. For 1972 he is subject to tax under section 871(a)(2) on his capital gains of $25,000 from the transactions in that year on the stock exchange, but he is not subject to the tax on the capital gain of $50,000 from the installment sale in 1971.
(3)
Determination of 183-day period
—(i)
In general.
In determining the total period of presence in the United States for a taxable year for purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, all separate periods of presence in the United States during the taxable year are to be aggregated. If the nonresident alien individual has not previously established a taxable year, as defined in section 441(b), he shall be treated as having a taxable year which is the calendar year, as defined in section 441(d). Subsequent adoption by such individual of a fiscal year as the taxable year will be treated as a change in the taxpayer's annual accounting period to which section 442 applies, and the change must be authorized under this part (Income Tax Regulations) or prior approval must be obtained by filing an application on Form 1128 in accordance with paragraph (b) of § 1.442-1. If in the course of his taxable year the nonresident alien individual changes his status from that of a citizen or resident of the United States to that of a nonresident alien individual, or vice versa, the determination of whether the individual has been present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year shall be made by taking into account the entire taxable year, and not just that part of the taxable year during which he has the status of a nonresident alien individual.
(ii)
Definition of “day”.
The term “day”, as used in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, means a calendar day during any portion of which the nonresident alien individual is physically present in the United States (within the meaning of sections 7701(a)(9) and 638) except that, in the case of an individual who is a resident of Canada or Mexico and, in the normal course of his employment in transportation service touching points within both Canada or Mexico and the United States, performs personal services in both the foreign country and the United States, the following rules shall apply:
(
a
) The performance of labor or personal services during 8 hours or more in any 1 day within the United States shall be considered as 1 day in the United States, except that if a period
of more or less than 8 hours is considered a full workday in the transportation job involved, such period shall be considered as 1 day within the United States.
(
b
) The performance of labor or personal services during less than 8 hours in any day in the United States shall, except as provided in (
a
) of this subdivision, be considered as a fractional part of a day in the United States. The total number of hours during which such services are performed in the United States during the taxable year, when divided by eight, shall be the number of days during which such individual shall be considered present in the United States during the taxable year.
(
c
) The aggregate number of days determined under (
a
) and (
b
) of this subdivision shall be considered the total number of days during which such individual is present in the United States during the taxable year.
(4)
Determination of amount of excess gains
—(i)
In general.
For the purpose of determining the excess of gains over losses subject to tax under this paragraph, gains and losses shall be taken into account only if, and to the extent that, they would be recognized and taken into account if the nonresident alien individual were engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year and such gains and losses were effectively connected for such year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by such individual. However, in determining such excess of gains over losses no deduction may be taken under section 1202, relating to the deduction for capital gains, or section 1212, relating to the capital loss carryover. Thus, for example, in determining such excess gains all amounts considered under chapter 1 of the Code as gains or losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets shall be taken into account, except those gains which are described in section 871(a)(1) (B) or (D) and taken into account under paragraph (c) of this section and are considered to be gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets. Also, for example, a loss described in section 631 (b) or (c) which is considered to be a loss from the sale of a capital asset shall be taken into account in determining the excess gains which are subject to tax under this paragraph. In further illustration, in determining such excess gains no deduction shall be allowed, pursuant to the provisions of section 267, for losses from sales or exchanges of property between related taxpayers. Any gains which are taken into account under section 871(a)(1) and paragraph (c) of this section shall not be taken into account in applying section 1231 for purposes of this paragraph. Gains and losses are to be taken into account under this paragraph whether they are short-term or long-term capital gains or losses within the meaning of section 1222.
(ii)
Gains not included.
The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to any gains described in section 871(a)(1) (B) or (D), and in subdivision (i), (iii), or (iv) of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, which are considered to be gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets.
(iii)
Allowance of losses.
In determining the excess of gains over losses subject to tax under this paragraph losses shall be allowed only to the extent provided by section 165(c). Losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets in excess of gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets shall not be taken into account.
(e)
Credits against tax.
The credits allowed by section 31 (relating to tax withheld on wages), by section 32 (relating to tax withheld at source on nonresident aliens), by section 39 (relating to certain uses of gasoline and lubricating oil), and by section 6402 (relating to overpayments of tax) shall be allowed against the tax of a nonresident alien individual determined in accordance with this section.
(f)
Effective date.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, this section shall apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966. Paragraph (b)(2) of this section is applicable to payments made after November 13, 1997. For corresponding rules applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see 26 CFR 1.871-7 (b) and (c) (Revised as of January 1, 1971).
[T.D. 7332, 39 FR 44219, Dec. 23, 1974, as amended by T.D. 8734, 62 FR 53416, Oct. 14, 1997; T.D. 8735, 62 FR 53501, Oct. 14, 1997]
§ 1.871-8
Taxation of nonresident alien individuals engaged in U.S. business or treated as having effectively connected income.
(a)
Segregation of income.
This section applies for purposes of determining the tax of a nonresident alien individual who at any time during the taxable year is engaged in trade or business in the United States. It also applies for purposes of determining the tax of a nonresident alien student or trainee who is deemed under section 871(c) and § 1.871-9 to be engaged in trade or business in the United States or of a nonresident alien individual who at no time during the taxable year is engaged in trade or business in the United States but has an election in effect for the taxable year under section 871(d) and § 1.871-10 in respect to real property income. A nonresident alien individual to whom this section applies must segregate his gross income for the taxable year into two categories, namely (1) the income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that individual, and (2) the income which is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that individual. A separate tax shall then be determined upon each such category of income, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The determination of whether income or gain is or is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the nonresident alien individual shall be made in accordance with section 864(
c
) and §§ 1.864-3 through 1.864-7. For purposes of this section income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States includes all income which is treated under section 871 (c) or (d) and § 1.871-9 or § 1.871-10 as income which is effectively connected for such year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the nonresident alien individual.
(b)
Imposition of tax
—(1)
Income not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
If a nonresident alien individual who is engaged in trade or business in the United States at any time during the taxable year derives during such year from sources within the United States income or gains described in section 871(a)(1), and paragraph (b) or (c) of § 1.871-7 or gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets determined as provided in section 871(a)(2) and paragraph (d) of § 1.871-7, which are not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that individual, such income or gains shall be subject to a flat tax of 30 percent of the aggregate amount of such items. This tax shall be determined in the manner, and subject to the same conditions, set forth in § 1.871-7 as though the income or gains were derived by a nonresident alien individual not engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year, except that (i) the rule in paragraph (d)(3) of such section for treating the calendar year as the taxable year shall not apply and (ii) in applying paragraph (c) and (d)(4) of such section, there shall not be taken into account any gains or losses which are taken into account in determining the tax under section 871(b) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. A nonresident alien individual who has an election in effect for the taxable year under section 871(d) and § 1.871-10 and who at no time during the taxable year is engaged in trade or business in the United States must determine his tax under § 1.871-7 on his income which is not treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, subject to the exception contained in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
(2)
Income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States
—(i)
In general.
If a nonresident alien to whom this section applies derives income or gains which are effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that individual, the taxable income or gains shall, except as provided in § 1.871-12, be taxed in accordance with section 1 or, in the alternative, section 1201(b). See section 871(b)(1). Any income of the nonresident alien individual which is
not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that individual shall not be taken into account in determining either the rate or amount of such tax. See paragraph (b) of § 1.872-1.
(ii)
Determination of taxable income.
The taxable income for any taxable year for purposes of this subparagraph consists only of the nonresident alien individual's taxable income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that individual; and, for this purpose, it is immaterial that the trade or business with which that income is effectively connected is not the same as the trade or business carried on in the United States by that individual during the taxable year. See example 2 in § 1.864-4(b). In determining such taxable income all amounts constituting, or considered to be, gains or losses for the taxable year from the sale or exchange of capital assets shall be taken into account if such gains or losses are effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that individual, and, for such purpose, the 183-day rule set forth in section 871(a)(2) and paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.871-7 shall not apply. Losses which are not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that individual shall not be taken into account in determining taxable income under this subdivision, except as provided in section 873(b)(1).
(iii)
Cross references.
For rules for determining the gross income and deductions for the taxable year, see sections 872 and 873, and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Change in trade or business status
—(1)
In general.
The determination as to whether a nonresident alien individual is engaged in trade or business within the United States during the taxable year is to be made for each taxable year. If at any time during the taxable year he is engaged in a trade or business in the United States, he is considered to be engaged in trade or business within the United States during the taxable year for purposes of sections 864(c)(1) and 871(b), and the regulations thereunder. Income, gain, or loss of a nonresident alien individual is not treated as being effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States if he is not engaged in trade or business within the United States during such year, even though such income, gain, or loss may have been effectively connected for a previous taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. See § 1.864-3. However, income, gain, or loss which is treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by a nonresident alien individual will generally be treated as effectively connected for a subsequent taxable year if he is engaged in a trade or business in the United States during such subsequent year, even though such income, gain, or loss is not effectively connected with the conduct of the trade or business carried on in the United States during such subsequent year. This subparagraph does not apply to income described in section 871 (c) or (d). It may not apply to a nonresident alien individual who for the taxable year uses an accrual method of accounting or to income which is constructively received in the taxable year within the meaning of § 1.451-2.

Illustrations.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
B, a nonresident alien individual using the calendar year as the taxable year and the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, is engaged in business (business R) in the United States from January 1, 1971, to August 31, 1971. During the period of September 1, 1971, to December 31, 1971, B receives installment payments of $30,000 on sales made in the United States by business R during that year, and the income from sources within the United States for that year attributable to such payments is $7,509. On September 15, 1971, another business (business S), which is carried on by B only in a foreign country sells to U.S. customers on the installment plan several pieces of equipment from inventory. During the period of September 16, 1971, to December 31, 1971, B receives installment payments of $50,000 on these sales by business S, and the income from sources within the United States for that year attributable to such payments is $10,000. Under section 864(c)(3)
and paragraph (b) of § 1.864-4 the entire income of $17,500 is effectively connected for 1971 with the conduct of a business in the United States by B. Accordingly, such income is taxable to B under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that during 1972 B receives installment payments of $20,000 from the sales made during 1971 in the United States by business R, and of $80,000 from the sales made in 1971 to U.S. customers by business S, the total income from sources within the United States for 1972 attributable to such payments being $13,000. At no time during 1972 is B engaged in a trade or business in the United States. Under section 864(c)(1)(B) the income of $13,000 for 1972 is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by B. Moreover, such income is not fixed or determinable annual or periodical income. Accordingly, no amount of such income is taxable to B under section 871.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example 2, except that during 1972 B is engaged in a new business (business T) in the United States from July 1, 1972, to December 31, 1972. Under section 864(c)(3) and paragraph (b) of § 1.864-4, the income of $13,000 is effectively connected for 1972 with the conduct of a business in the United States by B. Accordingly, such income is taxable to B under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example 2, except that the installment payments of $20,000 from the sales made during 1971 in the United States by business R and not received by B until 1972 could have been received by B in 1971 if he had so desired. Under § 1.451-2, B is deemed to have constructively received the payments of $20,000 in 1971. Accordingly, the income attributable to such payments is effectively connected for 1971 with the conduct of a business in the United States by B and is taxable to B in 1971 under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(d)
Credits against tax.
The credits allowed by section 31 (relating to tax withheld on wages), section 32 (relating to tax withheld at source on nonresident aliens), section 33 (relating to the foreign tax credit), section 35 (relating to partially tax-exempt interest), section 38 (relating to investment in certain depreciable property), section 39 (relating to certain uses of gasoline and lubricating oil), section 40 (relating to expenses of work incentive programs), and section 6402 (relating to overpayments of tax) shall be allowed against the tax determined in accordance with this section. However, the credits allowed by sections 33, 38, and 40 shall not be allowed against the flat tax of 30 percent imposed by section 871(a) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Moreover, no credit shall be allowed under section 35 to a non- resident alien individual with respect to whom a tax is imposed for the taxable year under section 871(a) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, even though such individual has income for such year upon which tax is imposed under section 871(b) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For special rules applicable in determining the foreign tax credit, see section 906(b) and the regulations thereunder. For the disallowance of certain credits where a return is not filed for the taxable year, see section 874 and § 1.874-1.
(e)
Effective date.
This section shall apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966. For corresponding rules applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see 26 CFR 1.871-7(d) (Revised as of January 1, 1971).

§ 1.871-9
Nonresident alien students or trainees deemed to be engaged in U.S. business.
(a)
Participants in certain exchange or training programs.
For purposes of §§ 1.871-7 and 1.871-8 a nonresident alien individual who is temporarily present in the United States during the taxable year as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (F) (relating to the admission of students into the United States) or subparagraph (J) (relating to the admission of teachers, trainees, specialists, etc., into the United States) of section 101(a)(15) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15) (F) or (J)), and who without regard to this paragraph is not engaged in trade or business in the United States during such year, shall be deemed to be engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year. For purposes of determining whether an alien who is present in the United States on an F visa or a J visa is a resident of the United States, see §§ 301.7701(b)-1 through 301.7701(b)-9 of this chapter.
(b)
Income treated as effectively connected with U.S. business.
Any income described in paragraph (1) (relating to
the nonexcluded portion of certain scholarship or fellowship grants) or paragraph (2) (relating to certain nonexcluded expenses incident to such grants) of section 1441(b) which is received during the taxable year from sources within the United States by a nonresident alien individual described in paragraph (a) of this section is to be treated for purposes of §§ 1.871-7, 1.871-8, 1.872-1, and 1.873-1 as income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that individual. However, such income is not to be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States for purposes of section 1441(c)(1) and paragraph (a) of § 1.1441-4. For exclusion relating to compensation paid to such individual by a foreign employer, see paragraph (b) of § 1.872-2.
(c)
Exchange visitors.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section a nonresident alien individual who is temporarily present in the United States during the taxable year as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (J) of section 101(a)(15) of the Immigration and Nationality Act includes a nonresident alien individual admitted to the United States as an “exchange visitor” under section 201 of the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (22 U.S.C. 1446), which section was repealed by section 111 of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (75 Stat. 538).
(d)
Mandatory application of rule.
The application of this section is mandatory and not subject to an election by the taxpayer.
(e)
Effective date.
This section shall apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966. For corresponding rules applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see 26 CFR 1.871-7(a)(3) (Revised as of January 1, 1971).

§ 1.871-10
Election to treat real property income as effectively connected with U.S. business.
(a)
When election may be made.
A nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation which during the taxable year derives any income from real property which is located in the United States and, in the case of a nonresident alien individual, held for the production of income, or derives income from any interest in any such property, may elect, pursuant to section 871(d) or 882(d) and this section, to treat all such income as income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that taxpayer. The election may be made whether or not the taxpayer is engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year for which the election is made or whether or not the taxpayer has income from real property which for the taxable year is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, but it may be made only with respect to that income from sources within the United States which, without regard to this section, is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the taxpayer. If for the taxable year the taxpayer has no income from real property located in the United States, or from any interest in such property, which is subject to the tax imposed by section 871(a) or 881(a), the election may not be made. But if an election has been properly made under this section for a taxable year, the election remains in effect, unless properly revoked, for subsequent taxable years even though during any such subsequent taxable year there is no income from the real property, or interest therein, in respect of which the election applies.
(b)
Income to which the election applies
—(1)
Included income.
An election under this section shall apply to all income from real property which is located in the United States and, in the case of a nonresident alien individual, held for the production of income, and to all income derived from any interest in such property, including (i) gains from the sale or exchange of such property or an interest therein, (ii) rents or royalties from mines, oil or gas wells, or other natural resources, and (iii) gains described in section 631 (b) or (c), relating to treatment of gain on the
disposal of timber, coal, or iron ore with a retained economic interest. The election may not be made with respect to only one class of such income. For purposes of the election, income from real property, or from any interest in real property, includes any amount included under section 652 or 662 in the gross income of a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation that is the beneficiary of an estate or trust if, by reason of the application of section 652(b) or 662(b), and the regulations thereunder, such amount has the character in the hands of that beneficiary of income from real property, or from any interest in real property. It is immaterial that no tax would be imposed on the income by section 871(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.871-7, or by section 881(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.881-2, if the election were not in effect. Thus, for example, if an election under this section has been made by a nonresident alien individual not engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year, the tax imposed by section 871(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.871-8 applies to his gains derived from the sale of real property located in the United States and held for the production of income, even though such income would not be subject to tax under section 871(a) if the election had not been made. In further illustration, assume that a nonresident alien individual not engaged in trade or business, or present, in the United States during the taxable year has income from sources within the United States consisting of oil royalties, rentals from a former personal residence, and capital gain from the sale of another residence held for the production of income. If he makes an election under this section, it will apply with respect to his royalties, rentals, and capital gain, even though such capital gain would not be subject to tax under section 871(a) if the election had not been made.
(2)
Income not included.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, income from real property, or from any interest in real property, does not include (i) interest on a debt obligation secured by a mortgage of real property, (ii) any portion of a dividend, within the meaning of section 316, which is paid by a corporation or a trust, such as a real estate investment trust described in section 857, which derives income from real property, (iii) in the case of a nonresident alien individual, income from real property, such as a personal residence, which is not held for the production of income or from any transaction in such property which was not entered into for profit, (iv) rentals from personal property, or royalties from intangible personal property, within the meaning of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, or (v) income which, without regard to section 871(d) or 882(d) and this section, is treated as income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
(3)
Rules applicable to personal property.
For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, in the case of a sales agreement, or rental or royalty agreement, affecting both real and personal property, the income from the transaction is to be allocated between the real property and the personal property in proportion to their respective fair market values unless the agreement specifically provides otherwise. In the case of such a rental or royalty agreement, the respective fair market values are to be determined as of the time the agreement is signed. In making determinations of this subparagraph, the principles of paragraph (c) of § 1.48-1, relating to the definition of “section 38 property,” apply for purposes of determining whether property is tangible or intangible personal property and of paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.1245-1 apply for purposes of making the allocation of income between real and personal property.
(c)
Effect of the election
—(1)
Determination of tax.
The income to which, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, an election under this section applies shall be subject to tax in the manner, and subject to the same conditions, provided by section 871(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.871-8, or by section 882(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.882-1. For purposes of determining such tax for the taxable year, income to which the election applies shall be aggregated with all other income of the nonresident alien individual or foreign
corporation which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that taxpayer. To the extent that deductions are connected with income from real property to which the election applies, they shall be treated for purposes of section 873(a) or section 882(c)(1) as connected with income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation. An election under this section does not cause a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation, which is not engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year, to be treated as though such taxpayer were engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year. Thus, for example, the compensation received during the taxable year for services performed in the United States in a previous taxable year by a nonresident alien individual, who has an election in effect for the taxable year under this section but is engaged in trade or business in the United States at no time during the taxable year, is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. In further illustration, gain for the taxable year from the casual sale of personal property described in section 1221(I) derived by a nonresident alien individual who is not engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year but has an election in effect for such year under this section is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. See § 1.864-3. If an election under this section is in effect for the taxable year, the income to which the election applies shall be treated, for purposes of section 871(b)(1) or section 882(a)(1), section 1441(c)(1), and paragraph (a) of § 1.1441-4, as income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the taxpayer.
(2)
Treatment of property to which election applies.
Any real property, or interest in real property, with respect to which an election under this section applies shall be treated as a capital asset which, if depreciable, is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167 and the regulations thereunder. Such property, or interest in property, shall be treated as property not used in a trade or business for purposes of applying any provisions of the Code, such as section 172(d)(4)(A), relating to gain or loss attributable to a trade or business for purposes of determining a net operating loss; section 1221(2), relating to property not constituting a capital asset; or section 1231(b), relating to special rules for treatment of gains and losses. For example, if a nonresident alien individual makes the election under this section and, while the election is in effect, sells unimproved land which is located in the United States and held for investment purposes, any gain or loss from the sale shall be considered gain or loss from the sale of a capital asset and shall be treated, for purposes of determining the tax under section 871(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.871-8, as a gain or loss which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
(d)
Manner of making or revoking an election
—(1)
Election, or revocation, without consent of Commissioner
—(i)
In general.
A nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation may, for the first taxable year for which the election under this section is to apply, make the initial election at any time before the expiration of the period prescribed by section 6511(a), or by section 6511(c) if the period for assessment is extended by agreement, for filing a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for such taxable year. This election may be made without the consent of the Commissioner. Having made the initial election, the taxpayer may, within the time prescribed for making the election for such taxable year, revoke the election without the consent of the Commissioner. If the revocation is timely and properly made, the taxpayer may make his initial election under this section for a later taxable year without the consent of the Commissioner. If the taxpayer revokes the initial election
without the consent of the Commissioner he must file amended income tax returns, or claims for credit or refund, where applicable, for the taxable years to which the revocation applies.
(ii)
Statement to be filed with return.
An election made under this section without the consent of the Commissioner shall be made for a taxable year by filing with the income tax return required under section 6012 and the regulations thereunder for such taxable year a statement to the effect that the election is being made. This statement shall include (
a
) a complete schedule of all real property, or any interest in real property, of which the taxpayer is titular or beneficial owner, which is located in the United States, (
b
) an indication of the extent to which the taxpayer has direct or beneficial ownership in each such item of real property, or interest in real property, (
c
) the location of the real property or interest therein, (
d
) a description of any substantial improvements on any such property, and (
e
) an identification of any taxable year or years in respect of which a revocation or new election under this section has previously occurred. This statement may not be filed with any return under section 6851 and the regulations thereunder.
(iii)
Exemption from withholding of tax.
For statement to be filed with a withholding agent at the beginning of a taxable year in respect of which an election under this section is to be made, see paragraph (a) of § 1.1441-4.
(2)
Revocation, or election, with consent of Commissioner
—(i)
In general.
If the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation makes the initial election under this section for any taxable year and the period prescribed by subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph for making the election for such taxable year has expired, the election shall remain in effect for all subsequent taxable years, including taxable years for which the taxpayer realizes no income from real property, or from any interest therein, or for which he is not required under section 6012 and the regulations thereunder to file an income tax return. However, the election may be revoked in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for any subsequent taxable year with the consent of the Commissioner. If the election for any such taxable year is revoked with the consent of the Commissioner, the taxpayer may not make a new election before his fifth taxable year which begins after the first taxable year for which the revocation is effective unless consent is given to such new election by the Commissioner in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.
(ii)
Effect of new election.
A new election made for the fifth taxable year, or taxable year thereafter, without the consent of the Commissioner, and a new election made with the consent of the Commissioner, shall be treated as an initial election to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies.
(iii)
Written request required.
A request to revoke an election made under this section when such revocation requires the consent of the Commissioner, or to make a new election when such election requires the consent of the Commissioner, shall be made in writing and shall be addressed to the Director of International Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC 20225. The request shall include the name and address of the taxpayer and shall be signed by the taxpayer or his duly authorized representative. It must specify the taxable year for which the revocation or new election is to be effective and shall be filed within 75 days after the close of the first taxable year for which it is desired to make the change. The request must specify the grounds which are considered to justify the revocation or new election. The Director of International Operations may require such other information as may be necessary in order to determine whether the proposed change will be permitted. A copy of the consent by the Director of International Operations shall be attached to the taxpayer's return required under section 6012 and the regulations thereunder for the taxable year for which the revocation or new election is effective. A copy of such consent may not be filed with any return under section 6851 and the regulations thereunder.
(3)
Election by partnership.
If a non-resident alien individual or foreign corporation is a member of a partnership
which has income described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section from real property, any election to be made under this section in respect of such income shall be made by the partners and not by the partnership. A nonresident alien or foreign corporation that makes an election generally must provide the partnership a Form W-8ECI, “Certificate of Foreign Person's Claim for Exemption from Withholding on Income Effectively Connected with the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States,” and attach to such form a copy of the election (or a statement that indicates that the nonresident alien or foreign corporation will make the election). However, if the nonresident alien or foreign corporation has already submitted a valid form to the partnership that establishes such partner's foreign status, the partner shall furnish the partnership a copy of the election (or a statement that indicates that the nonresident alien or foreign corporation will make the election). To the extent the partnership has income to which the election pertains, the partnership shall treat such income as effectively connected income subject to withholding under section 1446. See also § 1.1446-2.
(e)
Effective dates.
This section shall apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, except the last four sentences of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall apply to partnership taxable years beginning after May 18, 2005, or such earlier time as the regulations under §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-5 apply by reason of an election under § 1.1446-7. There are no corresponding rules in this part for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967.
[T.D. 7332, 39 FR 44222, Dec. 23, 1974, as amended by T.D. 9200, 70 FR 28717, May 18, 2005]
§ 1.871-11
Gains from sale or exchange of patents, copyrights, or similar property.
(a)
Contingent payment defined.
For purposes of section 871(a)(1)(D), section 881(a)(4), § 1.871-7(c)(1)(iv), § 1.881-2(c)(1)(iii), and this section, payments which are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of property or of an interest therein include continuing payments measured by a percentage of the selling price of the products marketed, or based on the number of units manufactured or sold, or based in a similar manner upon production, sale or use, or disposition of the property or interest transferred. A payment which is certain as to the amount to be received, but contingent as to the time of payment, or an installment payment of a principal sum agreed upon in a transfer agreement, shall not be treated as a contingent payment for purposes of this paragraph. For the inapplication of section 1253 to certain amounts described in this paragraph, see paragraph (a) of § 1.1253-1.
(b)
Payments treated as contingent on use.
Pursuant to section 871(e), if more than 50 percent of the gain of a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation for any taxable year from the sale or exchange after October 4, 1966, of any patent, copyright, secret process or formula, goodwill, trademark, trade brand, franchise, or other like property, or of any interest in any such property, is from payments which are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of such property or interest, all of the gain of such individual or corporation for the taxable year from the sale or exchange of such property or interest are, for purposes of section 871(a)(1)(D), section 881(a)(4), section 1441(b), or section 1442(a), and the regulations thereunder, to be treated as being from payments which are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of such property or interest. This paragraph does not apply for purposes of determining under section 871(b)(1) or 882(a)(1) the tax of a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation on income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
(c)
Sale or exchange.
A sale or exchange for purposes of this section includes, but is not limited to, a transfer by an individual which by reason of section 1235, relating to the sale or exchange of patents, is considered the sale or exchange of a capital asset. The provisions of section 1253, relating to transfers of franchises, trademarks, and trade names, do not apply in determining whether a transfer is a sale or exchange for purposes of this section.
(d)
Recovery of adjusted basis.
For purposes of determining for any taxable year the amount of gains which are subject to tax under section 871(a)(1)(D) or 881(a)(4), payments received by the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation during such year must be reduced by amounts representing recovery of the taxpayer's adjusted basis of the property or interest which is sold or exchanged. Where the taxpayer receives in the same taxable year payments which, without reference to section 871(e) and this section, are not contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the property or interest which is sold or exchanged and payments which are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the property or interest which is sold or exchanged, the taxpayer's unrecovered adjusted basis in the property or interest which is sold or exchanged must be allocated for the taxable year between such payments on the basis of the gross amount of each such type of payments. Where the taxpayer receives in the taxable year only payments which are not so contingent or only payments which are so contingent, the taxpayer's unrecovered basis must be allocated in its entirety to such payments for the taxable year.
(e)
Source rule.
In determining whether gains described in section 871(a)(1)(D) or 881(a)(4) and paragraph (b) of this section are received from sources within the United States, such gains shall be treated, for purposes of section 871(a)(1)(D), section 881(a)(4), section 1441(b), and section 1442(a), as rentals or royalties for the use of, or privilege of using, property or an interest in property. See section 861(a)(4), § 1.861-5, and paragraph (a) of § 1.862-1.
(f)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(a) A, a nonresident alien individual who uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and the calendar year as the taxable year, holds a U.S. patent which he developed through his own effort. On December 15, 1967, A enters into an agreement of sale with M Corporation, a domestic corporation, whereby A assigns to M Corporation all of his U.S. rights in the patent. In consideration of the sale, M Corporation is obligated to pay a fixed sum of $60,000, $20,000 being payable on execution of the contract and the balance payable in four annual installments of $10,000 each. As additional consideration, M Corporation agrees to pay to A a royalty in the amount of 2 percent of the gross sales of the products manufactured by M Corporation under the patent. A is not engaged in trade or business in the United States at any time during 1967 and 1968. His adjusted basis in the patent at the time of sale is $28,800.
(b) In 1967, A receives only the $20,000 paid by M Corporation on the execution of the contract of sale. No gain is realized by A upon receipt of this amount, and his unrecovered adjusted basis in the patent is reduced to $8,800 ($28,800 less $20,000).
(c) In 1968, M Corporation has gross sales of $600,000 from products manufactured under the patent. Consequently, for 1968, M Corporation pays $22,000 to A, $10,000 being the annual installment on the fixed payment and $12,000 being payments under the terms of the royalty provision. A's recognized gain for 1968 is $13,200 ($22,000 reduced by the unrecovered adjusted basis of $8,800). Of the total gain of $13,200, gain in the amount of $6,000 ($10,000− [$8,800 × $10,000/$22,000]) is considered to be from the fixed installment payment and of $7,200 ($12,000−[$8,800 × $12,000/$22,000]) is considered to be from the royalty payment. Since 54.5 percent ($7,200/$13,200) of the gain recognized in 1968 from the sale of the patent is from payments which are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the patent, all of the $13,200 gain recognized in 1968 is treated, for purposes of section 871(a)(1)(D) and section 1441(b), as being from payments which are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the patent.

# Example 2.
(a) F, a foreign corporation using the calendar year as the taxable year and not engaged in trade or business in the United States, holds a U.S. patent on certain property which it developed through its own efforts. Corporation F uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. On December 1, 1966, F Corporation enters into an agreement of sale with D Corporation, a domestic corporation, whereby D Corporation purchases the exclusive right and license, and the right to sublicense to others, to manufacture, use, and/or sell certain devices under the patent in the United States during the term of the patent. The agreement grants D Corporation the right to dispose, anywhere in the world, of machinery manufactured in the United States and equipped with such devices. Corporation D is granted the right, at its own expense, to prosecute infringers in its own name or in the name of F Corporation, or both, and to retain any damages recovered.
(b) Corporation D agrees to pay to F Corporation annually $5 for each device manufactured under the patent during the year but in no case less than $5,000 per year. In
1967, D Corporation manufactures 2,500 devices under the patent; and, in 1968, 1,500 devices. Under the terms of the contract D Corporation pays to F Corporation in 1967 $12,500 with respect to production in that year and $7,500 in 1968 with respect to production in that year. F Corporation's basis in the patent at the time of the sale is $17,000.
(c) With respect to the payments received by F Corporation in 1967, no gain is realized by that corporation and its unrecovered adjusted basis in the patent is reduced to $4,500 ($17,000 less $12,500).
(d) With respect to the payments received by F Corporation in 1968, such corporation has recognized gain of $3,000 ($7,500 reduced by unrecovered adjusted basis of $4,500). Of the total gain of $3,000, gain in the amount of $2,000 ($5,000− [$4,500 × $5,000/$7,500]) is considered to be from the fixed installment payment and of $1,000 ($2,500−[$4,500 × $2,500/$7,500]) is considered to be from payments which are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the patent. Since 33.3 percent ($1,000/$3,000) of the gain recognized in 1968 from the sale of the patent is from payments which are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the patent, only $1,000 of the $3,000 gain for that year constitutes gains which, for purposes of section 881(a)(4) and section 1442(a), are from payments which are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the patent. The balance of $2,000 is gain from the sale of property and is not subject to tax under section 881(a).
(g)
Effective date.
This section shall apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, but only in respect of gains from sales or exchanges occurring after October 4, 1966. There are no corresponding rules in this part for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967.
[T.D. 7332, 39 FR 44224, Dec. 23, 1974]
§ 1.871-12
Determination of tax on treaty income.
(a)
In general.
This section applies for purposes of determining under § 1.871-7 or § 1.871-8 the tax of a nonresident alien individual, or under § 1.881-2 or § 1.882-1 the tax of a foreign corporation, which for the taxable year has income described in section 872(a) or 882(b) upon which the tax is limited by an income tax convention to which the United States is a party. Income for such purposes does not include income of any kind which is exempt from tax under the provisions of an income tax convention to which the United States is a party. See §§ 1.872-2(c) and 1.883-1(b). This section shall not apply to a nonresident alien individual who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico during the entire taxable year.
(b)
Definition of treaty and nontreaty income
—(1)
In general.
(i) For purposes of this section the term “treaty income” shall be construed to mean the gross income of a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation, as the case may be, the tax on which is limited by a tax convention. The term “non-treaty income” shall be construed, for such purposes, to mean the gross income of the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation other than the treaty income. Neither term includes income of any kind which is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code.
(ii) In determining either the treaty or nontreaty income the gross income shall be determined in accordance with §§ 1.872-1 and 1.872-2, or with §§ 1.882-3 and 1.883-1, except that in determining the treaty income the exclusion granted by section 116(a) for dividends shall not be taken into account. Thus, for example, treaty income includes the total amount of dividends paid by a domestic corporation not disqualified by section 116(b) and received from sources within the United States if, in accordance with a tax convention, the dividends are subject to the income tax at a rate not to exceed 15 percent but does not include interest which, in accordance with a tax convention, is exempt from the income tax. In further illustration, neither the treaty nor the nontreaty income includes interest on certain governmental obligations which by reason of section 103 is excluded from gross income, or interest which by reason of a tax convention is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code.
(iii) For purposes of applying any income tax convention to which the United States is a party, original issue discount which is subject to tax under section 871(a)(1)(C) or 881(a)(3) is to be treated as interest, and gains which are subject to tax under section 871(a)(1)(D) or 881(a)(4) are to be treated as royalty income. This subdivision shall not apply, however, where its application
would be contrary to any treaty obligation of the United States.
(2)
Application of permanent establishment rule of treaties.
In applying this section with respect to income which is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation, see section 894(b), which provides that with respect to such income the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation shall be deemed not to have a permanent establishment in the United States at any time during the taxable year for purposes of applying any exemption from, or reduction in rate of, tax provided by any tax convention.
(c)
Determination of tax
—(1)
In general.
If the gross income of a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation, as the case may be, consists of both treaty and nontreaty income, the tax liability for the taxable year shall be the sum of the amounts determined in accordance with subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph. In no case, however, may the tax liability so determined exceed the tax liability (tax reduced by allowable credits) with respect to the taxpayer's entire income, determined in accordance with § 1.871-7 or § 1.871-8, or with § 1.881-2 or § 1.882-1, as though the tax convention had not come into effect and without reference to the provisions of this section. Determinations under this paragraph shall be made without taking into account any credits allowed by sections 31, 32, 39, and 6402, but such credits shall be allowed against the tax liability determined in accordance with this subparagraph.
(2)
Tax on nontreaty income.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, compute a partial tax (determined without the allowance of any credit) upon only the nontreaty income in accordance with § 1.871-7 or § 1.871-8, or with § 1.881-2 or § 1.882-1, whichever applies, as though the tax convention had not come into effect. To the extent allowed by paragraph (d) of § 1.871-8, or paragraph (c) of § 1.882-1, the credits allowed by sections 33, 35, 38, and 40 shall then be allowed, without taking into account any item included in the treaty income, against the tax determined under this subparagraph.
(3)
Tax on treaty income.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, compute a tax upon the gross amount, determined without the allowance of any deduction, of each separate item of treaty income at the reduced rate applicable to that item under the tax convention. No credits shall be allowed against the tax determined under this subparagraph.
(d)
Illustration.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(a) A nonresident alien individual who is a resident of a foreign country with which the United States has entered into a tax convention receives during the taxable year 1967 from sources within the United States total gross income of $22,000, consisting of the following items:
Compensation for personal services the tax on which is not limited by the tax convention (effectively connected income under § 1.864-4(c)(6)(ii))
$20,000
Oil royalties the tax on which is limited by the tax convention to 15 percent of the gross amount thereof (effectively connected income by reason of election under § 1.871-10)
2,000
Total gross income
22,000
(b) The taxpayer is engaged in business in the United States during the taxable year but does not have a permanent establishment therein. There are no allowable deductions, other than the deductions allowed by sections 613 and 873(b)(3).
(c) The tax liability for the taxable year is $6,100, determined as follows:
Nontreaty gross income
$20,000
Less: Deduction for personal exemption
600
Nontreaty taxable income
19,400
Tax under section 1 of the Code on nontreaty taxable income ($5,170 plus 45 percent of $1,400)
5,800
Plus: Tax on treaty income (Gross oil royalties) ($2,000 × 15 percent)
300
Total tax (determined as provided in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section)
6,100
(d) If the tax had been determined under paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.871-8 as though the tax liability would have been $6,478, determined as follows and by taking into account the election under § 1.871-10:
Total gross income
$22,000
Less: Deduction under section 613 for percentage depletion ($2000 × 27
1/2
percent)
$550
Deduction for personal exemption
600
1,150
Taxable income
20,850
Tax under section 1 of the Code on taxable income ($6,070 plus 48 percent of $850)
6,478
(e)
Effective date.
This section shall apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966. For corresponding rules applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see 26 CFR 1.871-7(e) (Revised as of January 1, 1971).
[T.D. 7332, 39 FR 44225, Dec. 23, 1974, as amended at T.D. 8657, 61 FR 9338, Mar. 8, 1996]
§ 1.871-13
Taxation of individuals for taxable year of change of U.S. citizenship or residence.
(a)
In general.
(1) An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States at the beginning of the taxable year but a nonresident alien at the end of the taxable year, or a nonresident alien at the beginning of the taxable year but a citizen or resident of the United States at the end of the taxable year, is taxable for such year as though his taxable year were comprised of two separate periods, one consisting of the time during which he is a citizen or resident of the United States and the other consisting of the time during which he is not a citizen or resident of the United States. Thus, for example, the income tax liability of an alien individual under chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year in which he changes his residence will be computed under two different sets of rules, one relating to resident aliens for the period of residence and the other relating to nonresident aliens for the period of nonresidence. However, in determining the taxable income for such year which is subject to the graduated rate of tax imposed by section 1 or 1201 of the Code, all income for the period of U.S. citizenship or residence must be aggregated with the income for the period of nonresidence which is effectively connected for such year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. This section does not apply to alien individuals treated as residents for the entire taxable year under section 6013 (g) or (h). These individuals are taxed under the rules in § 1.1-1(b).
(2) For purposes of this section, an individual is deemed to be a citizen or resident of the United States for the day on which he becomes a citizen or resident of the United States, a nonresident of the United States for the day on which he abandons his U.S. residence, and an alien for the day on which he gives up his U.S. citizenship.
(b)
Acquisition of U.S. citizenship or residence.
Income from sources without the United States which is not effectively connected with the conduct by the taxpayer of a trade or business in the United States is not taxable if received by an alien individual while he is not a resident of the United States even though he becomes a citizen or resident of the United States after its receipt and before the close of the taxable year. However, income from sources without the United States which is not effectively connected with the conduct by the taxpayer of a trade or business in the United States is taxable if received by an individual while he is a citizen or resident of the United States, even though he earns the income earlier in the taxable year while he is neither a citizen nor resident of the United States.
(c)
Abandonment of U.S. citizenship or residence.
Income from sources without the United States which is not effectively connected with the conduct by the taxpayer of a trade or business in the United States is not taxable if received by an alien individual while he is not a resident of the United States, even though he earns the income earlier in the taxable year while he is a citizen or resident of the United States. However, income from sources without the United States which is not effectively connected with the conduct by the taxpayer of a trade or business in the United States is taxable if received by an individual while he is a citizen or resident of the United States, even though he abandons his U.S. citizenship or residence after its receipt and before the close of the taxable year.
(d)
Special rules
—(1)
Method of accounting.
Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may not apply to an individual who for the taxable year uses an accrual method of accounting.
(2)
Deductions for personal exemptions.
An alien individual to whom this section applies is entitled to deduct one personal exemption for the taxable year under section 151. In addition, he
is entitled to such additional exemptions as are allowed as a deduction under section 151 but only to the extent the amount of such additional exemptions do not exceed his taxable income (determined without regard to any deduction for personal exemptions) for the period in the taxable year during which he is a citizen or resident of the United States. This subparagraph does not apply to the extent it is inconsistent with section 873, and the regulations thereunder, or with the provisions of an income tax convention to which the United States is a party.
(3)
Exclusion of dividends received.
In determining the $100 exclusion for the taxable year provided by section 116 in respect of certain dividends, only those dividends for the period during which the individual is neither a citizen nor resident of the United States may be taken into account as are effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. See § 1.116-1(e)(1).
(e)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a married alien individual who uses the calendar year as the taxable year and the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, becomes a resident of the United States on June 1, 1971. During the period of nonresidence from January 1, 1971, to May 31, 1971, inclusive, A receives $15,000 income from sources without the United States which is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. During the period of residence from June 1, 1971, to December 31, 1971, A receives wages of $10,000, dividends of $200 from a foreign corporation, and dividends of $75 from a domestic corporation qualifying under section 116(a). Of the amount of wages so received, $2,000 is for services performed by A outside the United States during the period of nonresidence. Total allowable deductions (other than for personal exemptions) amount to $700, none of which are deductible under section 62 in computing adjusted gross income. For 1971 A's spouse has no gross income and is not the dependent of another taxpayer. For 1971, A's taxable income is $8,200, all of which is subject to tax under section 1, as follows:
Wages
$10,000
Dividends from foreign corporation
200
Dividends from domestic corporation ($75 less $75 exclusion)
0
Adjusted gross income
10,200
Less deductions:
Personal exemptions (2 × $650)
$1,300
Other allowable deductions
700
2,000
Taxable income
8,200

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that during the period of nonresidence from January 1, 1971, to May 31, 1971, A receives from sources within the United States income of $1,850 which is effectively connected with the conduct by A of a business in the United States and $350 in dividends from domestic corporations qualifying under section 116(a). Only $50 of these dividends are effectively connected with the conduct by A of a business in the United States. The assumption is made that there are no allowable deductions connected with such effectively connected income. For 1971, A has taxable income of $10,075 subject to tax under section 1 and $300 income subject to tax under section 871(a)(1)(A), as follows:
Wages
$10,000
Business income
1,850
Dividends from foreign corporation
200
Dividends from domestic corporation ($125 less $100 exclusion)
25
Adjusted gross income
12,075
Less deductions:
Personal exemptions (2 × $650)
$1,300
Other allowable deductions
700
2,000
Taxable income subject to tax under section 1
10,075
Income subject to tax under section 871(a)(1)(A)
300

# Example 3.
A, a married alien individual with three children, uses the calendar year as the taxable year and the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. On October 1, 1971, A and his family become residents of the United States. During the period of nonresidence from January 1, 1971, to September 30, 1971, A receives income of $18,000 from sources without the United States which is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and of $2,500 from sources within the United States which is effectively connected with the conduct of a business in the United States. It is assumed there are no allowable deductions connected with such effectively connected income. During the period of residence from October 1, 1971, to December 31, 1971, A receives wages of $2,000, of which $400 is for services performed outside the United States during the period of nonresidence. Total allowable deductions (other than for personal exemptions) amount to $250, none of which are deductible under section 62 in computing adjusted gross income. Neither the spouse nor any of the children has any gross income for 1971, and the spouse is not the dependent of another taxpayer for such year. For 1971, A's taxable income is $1,850, all of which is subject to tax under section 1, as follows:
Wages (residence period)
$2,000
Less: Allowable deductions
250
Taxable income (without deduction for personal exemptions) (residence period)
$1,750
Business income (nonresidence period)
2,500
Total taxable income (without deduction for personal exemptions)
4,250
Less deduction for personal exemptions:
Taxpayer
650
Wife and 3 children (4 × $650, but not to exceed $1,750)
1,750
2,400

§ 1.871-14
Rules relating to repeal of tax on interest of nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations received from certain portfolio debt investments.
(a)
General rule.
No tax shall be imposed under section 871(a)(1)(A), 871(a)(1)(C), 881(a)(1) or 881(a)(3) on any portfolio interest as defined in sections 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) received by a foreign person. But see section 871(b) or 882(a) if such interest is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
(b)
Rules concerning obligations in bearer form before March 19, 2012
—(1)
In general.
Interest (including original issue discount) with respect to an obligation in bearer form is portfolio interest within the meaning of section 871(h)(2)(A) or 881(c)(2)(A) only if it is paid with respect to an obligation issued after July 18, 1984, and issued before March 19, 2012, that is described in section 163(f)(2)(B), as in effect before the amendment by section 502 of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010 (HIRE Act), Public Law 111-147, and the regulations under that section and an exception under section 871(h) or 881(c) does not apply. Any obligation that is not in registered form as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is an obligation in bearer form.
(2)
Coordination with withholding and reporting rules.
For an exemption from withholding under section 1441 with respect to obligations described in this paragraph (b), see § 1.1441-1(b)(4)(i). See § 1.1471-2 for rules relating to withholding under chapter 4 of the Code that may apply to withholdable payments (as defined in § 1.1471-4(b)(145)) made on or after July 1, 2014, with respect to an agreement or instrument that is not treated as an obligation outstanding before March 19, 2012. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the terms
obligation
and
outstanding
are described in § 1.1471-2(b)). See also § 1.1471-4(d)(6) for the reporting requirements of participating foreign financial institutions (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(91)) with respect to accounts held by recalcitrant account holders (as defined in § 1.1471-5(g)). For rules relating to an exemption from Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding under section 3406, see section 6049 and § 1.6049-5(b)(8) for the payment of interest and § 1.6045-1(g)(1)(ii) for the redemption, retirement, or sale of an obligation in bearer form.
(c)
Rules concerning obligations in registered form
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Obligation in registered form.
For purposes of this section, an obligation is in registered form only as provided in this paragraph (c)(1)(i). The conditions for an obligation to be considered in registered form are identical to the conditions described in § 5f.103-1 of this chapter. Therefore, an obligation that would be an obligation in registered form except for the fact that it can be converted at any time in the future into an obligation that is not in registered form shall not be an obligation in registered form. An obligation that is not in registered form by reason of the preceding sentence may nevertheless be in registered form, but only after the possibility of conversion is terminated. An obligation that is not in registered form and can be converted into an obligation that would meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) for being in registered form shall be considered in registered form only after the conversion is effected. For purposes of this section, an obligation is convertible if the obligation can be transferred by any means not described
in § 5f.103-1(c) of this chapter. An obligation is treated as an obligation in registered form if—
(A) The obligation is registered as to both principal and any stated interest with the issuer (or its agent) and transfer of the obligation may be effected only by surrender of the old instrument, and either the reissuance by the issuer of the old instrument to the new holder or the issuance by the issuer of a new instrument to the new holder;
(B) The right to the principal of, and stated interest on, the obligation may be transferred only through a book entry system maintained by the issuer (or its agent) described in this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B). An obligation shall be considered transferable through a book entry system if the ownership of an interest in the obligation, is required to be reflected in a book entry, whether or not physical securities are issued. A book entry is a record of ownership that identifies the owner of an interest in the obligation; or
(C) It is registered as to both principal and any stated interest with the issuer (or its agent) and may be transferred by way of either of the methods described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) (A) or (B) of this section.
(ii)
Requirements for portfolio interest qualification in the case of an obligation in registered form.
Interest (including original issue discount) received on an obligation that is in registered form qualifies as portfolio interest only if—
(A) The interest is paid on an obligation issued after July 18, 1984;
(B) The interest would be subject to tax under section 871(a)(1)(A), 871(a)(1)(C), 881(a)(1) or 881(a)(3) but for section 871(h) or 881(c);
(C) A United States (U.S.) person otherwise required to deduct and withhold tax under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) receives a statement that meets the requirements of section 871(h)(5) that the beneficial owner of the obligation is not a U.S. person; and
(D) An exception under section 871(h) or 881(c) does not apply.
(2)
Required statement.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, a U.S. person will be considered to have received a statement that meets the requirements of section 871(h)(5) if either it complies with one of the procedures described in this paragraph (c)(2) and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person or it complies with the procedures described in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section (to the extent applicable).
(i) The U.S. person (or its authorized agent described in § 1.1441-7(c)(2)) can reliably associate the payment with documentation upon which it can rely to treat the payment as made to a foreign beneficial owner in accordance with § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii). See § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) for rules regarding reliable association with documentation.
(ii) The U.S. person (or its authorized agent described in § 1.1441-7(c)(2)) can reliably associate the payment with a withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-5(c)(2)(iv) from a person claiming to be a withholding foreign partnership or § 1.1441-5(e)(v) for a person claiming to be a withholding foreign trust.
(iii) The U.S. person (or its authorized agent described in § 1.1441-7(c)(2)) can reliably associate the payment with a withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii) from a person representing to be a qualified intermediary that has assumed primary withholding responsibility for the payment in accordance with § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(iv) or a qualified intermediary that has provided a withholding statement that meets the requirements of § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v)(C) or that includes the payment in a withholding rate pool for payments excepted from withholding.
(iv) The U.S. person (or its authorized agent described in § 1.1441-7(c)(2)) can reliably associate the payment with a withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(v) from a person claiming to be a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or of a foreign insurance company that is described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A) or a U.S. branch designated in accordance with § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(E).
(v) The U.S. person receives a statement from a securities clearing organization, a bank, or another financial institution that holds customers' securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business. In such case the statement
must be signed under penalties of perjury by an authorized representative of the financial institution and must state that the institution has received from the beneficial owner a withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) (a Form W-8 or an acceptable substitute form as defined § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(vi)) or that it has received from another financial institution a similar statement that it, or another financial institution acting on behalf of the beneficial owner, has received the Form W-8 from the beneficial owner. In the case of multiple financial institutions between the beneficial owner and the U.S. person, this statement must be given by each financial institution to the one above it in the chain. No particular form is required for the statement provided by the financial institutions. However, the statement must provide the name and address of the beneficial owner, and a copy of the Form W-8 provided by the beneficial owner must be attached. The statement is subject to the same rules described in § 1.1441-1(e)(4) that apply to intermediary Forms W-8 described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii). If the information on the Form W-8 changes, the beneficial owner must so notify the financial institution acting on its behalf within 30 days of such changes, and the financial institution must promptly so inform the U.S. person. This notice also must be given if the financial institution has actual knowledge that the information has changed but has not been so informed by the beneficial owner. In the case of multiple financial institutions between the beneficial owner and the U.S. person, this notice must be given by each financial institution to the institution above it in the chain.
(vi) The U.S. person complies with procedures that the U.S. competent authority may agree to with the competent authority of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty in effect.

Time for providing certificate or documentary evidence
—(i)
General rule.
Interest on a registered obligation shall qualify as portfolio interest if the withholding certificate or documentary evidence that must be provided is furnished before expiration of the beneficial owner's period of limitation for claiming a refund of tax with respect to such interest. See, however, § 1.1441-1(b)(7) for consequences to a withholding agent that makes a payment without withholding even though it cannot reliably associate the payment with the documentation prior to the payment. If a withholding agent withholds an amount under chapter 3 of the Code because it cannot reliably associate the payment with the documentation for the beneficial owner on the date of payment, the beneficial owner may nevertheless claim the benefit of an exemption from tax under this section by claiming a refund or credit for the amount withheld based upon the procedures described in §§ 1.1464-1 and 301.6402-3(e) of this chapter. See §§ 1.1474-5 and 301.6402-3(e) of this chapter for the allowance and requirements for a refund with respect to an amount (including a payment of interest) that was withheld upon under chapter 4 of the Code. In the alternative, adjustments to any amount of overwithheld tax may be made under the procedures described in § 1.1461-2(a) for a payment withheld upon under chapter 3 of the Code or in § 1.1474-2 for a payment withheld upon under chapter 4 of the Code.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (c)(3) and their coordination with § 1.1441-1(b)(7):

# Example.
A is a withholding agent who, on October 12, 2001, pays interest on a registered obligation to B, a foreign corporation. B is a calendar year taxpayer, engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and is, therefore, required to file an annual income tax return on Form 1120F. The interest, however, is not effectively connected with B's U.S. trade or business. On the date of payment, B has not furnished, and A cannot associate the payment with documentation for B. However, A does not withhold under section 1442, even though, under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(A), A should presume that B is a foreign person, because A's communications with B are mailed to an address in a foreign country. Assuming that B files a return for its taxable year ending December 31, 2001, and that its statute of limitations period with regard to that year expires on June 15, 2005, the interest paid on October 12, 2001, may qualify as portfolio interest only if B provides appropriate documentation to A on or before June 15, 2005. If B does not provide the documentation on or before June 15, 2005, and does not pay the
tax, A is liable for the tax under section 1463, even if B provides the documentation to A after June 15, 2005. Therefore, the provisions in § 1.1441-1(b)(7), regarding late-received documentation would not help A avoid liability for tax under section 1463 even if the documentation is furnished within the statute of limitations period of A. This is because, in a case involving interest, the documentation received within the limitations period of the beneficial owner serves as a condition for the interest to qualify as portfolio interest. When documentation is received after the expiration of the beneficial owner's limitations period, the interest can no longer qualify as portfolio interest. On the other hand, A could rely on documentation that it receives after the expiration of B's limitations period to establish B's right to a reduced rate of withholding under an applicable income tax treaty (since, in such a case, a claim of treaty benefits is not conditioned upon providing documentation prior to the expiration of the beneficial owner's limitations period).
(4)
Coordination with withholding and reporting rules.
For an exemption from withholding under section 1441 with respect to obligations described in this paragraph (c)(4), see § 1.1441-1(b)(4)(i). For rules applicable to withholding certificates, see § 1.1441-1(e)(4). For rules regarding documentary evidence, see § 1.6049-5(c)(1). For application of presumptions when the U.S. person cannot reliably associate the payment with documentation, see § 1.1441-1(b)(3). For standards of knowledge applicable to withholding agents, see § 1.1441-7(b). For rules relating to reporting on Forms 1042 and 1042-S, see § 1.1461-1(b) and (c). For rules relating to an exemption from Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding under section 3406, see section 6049 and § 1.6049-5(b)(8) for the payment of interest and § 1.6045-1(g)(1)(i) for the redemption, retirement, or sale of an obligation in registered form. For rules relating to withholding under sections 1471 and 1472 that may apply notwithstanding the exemption for payments of portfolio interest under section 1441, see §§ 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), and 1.1472-1(b).
(d)
Application of repeal of 30-percent withholding to pass-through certificates
—(1)
In general.
Interest received on a pass-through certificate qualifies as portfolio interest under section 871(h)(2) or 881(c)(2) if the interest satisfies the conditions described in paragraph (b)(1), (c)(1), or (e) of this section without regard to whether any obligation held by the fund or trust to which the pass-through certificate relates is described in paragraph (b)(1), (c)(1)(ii), or (e) of this section. This paragraph (d)(1) applies only to payments made to the holder of the pass-through certificate from the trustee of the pass-through trust and does not apply to payments made to the trustee of the pass-through trust. For example, a mortgage pass-through certificate in bearer form must meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but the obligations held by the fund or trust to which the mortgage pass-through certificate relates need not meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(1), (c)(1)(ii), or (e) of this section. However, for purposes of paragraphs (b)(1), (c)(1)(ii), and (e) of this section and section 127 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, a pass-through certificate will be considered as issued after July 18, 1984, only to the extent that the obligations held by the fund or trust to which the pass-through certificate relates are issued after July 18, 1984.
(2)
Interest in REMICs.
Interest received on a regular or residual interest in a REMIC qualifies as portfolio interest under section 871(h)(2) or 881(c)(2) if the interest satisfies the conditions described in paragraph (b)(1), (c)(1)(ii), or (e) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1), (c)(1)(ii), or (e) of this section, interest on a regular interest in a REMIC is not considered interest on any mortgage obligations held by the REMIC. The foregoing rule, however, applies only to payments made to the holder of the regular interest from the REMIC and does not apply to payments made to the REMIC. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1), (c)(1)(ii), or (e) of this section, interest on a residual interest in a REMIC is considered to be interest on or with respect to the obligations held by the REMIC, and not on or with respect to the residual interest. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1), (c)(1)(ii), and (e) of this section and section 127 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, a residual interest in a REMIC will be considered as issued after July 18, 1984, only to the extent that the obligations held by the REMIC are issued
after July 18, 1984, but a regular interest in a REMIC will be considered as issued after July 18, 1984, if the regular interest was issued after July 18, 1984, without regard to the date on which the mortgage obligations held by the REMIC were issued.
(3)
Date of issuance.
In general, a mortgage pass-through certificate will be considered to have been issued after July 18, 1984, if all of the mortgages held by the fund or trust were issued after July 18, 1984. If some of the mortgages held by the fund or trust were issued before July 19, 1984, then the portion of any interest payment which represents interest on those mortgages shall not be considered to be portfolio interest. The preceding sentence shall not apply, however, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) The mortgage pass-through certificate is issued after December 31, 1986;
(ii) Payment of the mortgage pass-through certificate is guaranteed by, and a guarantee commitment has been issued by, an entity that is independent from the issuer of the underlying obligation;
(iii) The guarantee commitment with respect to the mortgage pass-through certificate cannot have been issued more than 14 months prior to the date on which the mortgage pass-through certificate is issued; and
(iv) The fund or trust to which the mortgage pass-through certificate relates cannot contain mortgage obligations on which the first scheduled monthly payment of principal and interest was made more than twelve months before the date on which the guarantee commitment was made.
(e)
Foreign-targeted registered obligations
—(1)
General rule.
The statement described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is not required with respect to interest paid on an obligation issued before January 1, 2016, that is a registered obligation targeting foreign markets in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section if the interest is paid by a U.S. person, a withholding foreign partnership, or a U.S. branch described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A) or (E) to a registered owner at an address outside the United States, provided that the registered owner is a financial institution described in section 871(h)(5)(B). In that case, the U.S. person otherwise required to deduct and withhold tax may treat the interest as portfolio interest if it does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a United States person and if it receives the certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section from a financial institution or member of a clearing organization, which member is the beneficial owner of the obligation, or the documentary evidence or statement described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section from the beneficial owner, in accordance with the procedures described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(2)
Definition of a foreign-targeted registered obligation.
An obligation is considered to be targeted to foreign markets for purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section if it is sold (or resold in connection with its original issuance) only to foreign persons (or to foreign branches of United States financial institutions described in section 871(h)(5)(B)) in accordance with procedures similar to those prescribed in § 1.163-5(c)(2)(i) (A), (B), or (D). However, the provisions of that section that require an obligation to be offered for sale or resale in connection with its original issuance only outside the United States do not apply with respect to registered obligations offered for sale through a public auction. Similarly, the provisions of that section that require delivery to be made outside the United States do not apply to registered obligations offered for sale through a public auction if the obligations are considered to be in registered form by virtue of the fact that they may be transferred only through a book entry system. The obligation, if evidenced by a physical document other than a confirmation receipt, must contain on its face a legend indicating that it has been sold (or resold in connection with its original issuance) in accordance with those procedures.
(3)
Documentation.
A certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is required if the United States person otherwise required to deduct and withhold tax (the withholding
agent) pays interest to a financial institution described in section 871(h)(5)(B) or to a member of a clearing organization, which member is the beneficial owner of the obligation. The documentation described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is required if a withholding agent pays interest to a beneficial owner that is neither a financial institution described in section 871(h)(5)(B) nor a member of a clearing organization.
(i)
Interest paid to a financial institution or a member of a clearing organization
—(A)
Requirement of a certificate.
(
1
) If the withholding agent pays interest to a financial institution described in section 871(h)(5)(B) or to a member of a clearing organization, which member is the beneficial owner of the obligation, the withholding agent must receive a certificate which states that, beginning at the time the last preceding certificate under this paragraph (e)(3)(i) was provided and while the financial institution or clearing organization member has held the obligation, with respect to each foreign-targeted registered obligation which has been held by the person providing the certificate at any time since the provision of such last preceding certificate, either—
(
i
) The beneficial owner of the obligation has not been a United States person on each interest payment date; or
(
ii
) If the person providing the certificate is a financial institution which is holding or has held an obligation on behalf of the beneficial owner, the beneficial owner of the obligation has been a United States person on one or more interest payment dates (identifying such date or dates), and the person making the certification has forwarded or will forward the appropriate United States beneficial ownership notification to the withholding agent in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(
2
) The person providing the certificate need not state the foregoing where no previous certificate has been required to be provided by the payee to the withholding agent under this paragraph (e)(3)(i).
(B)
Additional representations.
Whether or not a previous certificate has been required to be provided with respect to the obligation, each certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions in this paragraph (e)(3)(i) must further state that, for each foreign-targeted registered obligation held and every other such obligation to be acquired and held by the person providing the certificate during the period beginning on the date of the certificate and ending on the date the next certificate is required to be provided, the beneficial owner of the obligation will not be a United States person on each interest payment date while the financial institution or clearing organization member holds the obligation and that, if the person providing the certificate is a financial institution which is holding or will be holding the obligation on behalf of a beneficial owner, such person will provide a United States beneficial ownership notification to the withholding agent (and a clearing organization that is not a withholding agent where a member organization is required by this paragraph (e)(3) to furnish the clearing organization with a statement) in accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of this section in the event such certificate (or statement in the case of a statement provided by a member organization to a clearing organization that is not a withholding agent) is or becomes untrue with respect to any obligation. A clearing organization is an entity which is in the business of holding obligations for member organizations and transferring obligations among such members by credit or debit to the account of a member without the necessity of physical delivery of the obligation.
(C)
Obligation must be identified.
The certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section must identify the obligation or obligations with respect to which it is given, except where the certification is given with respect to an obligation that has not been acquired at the time the certification is made. An obligation is identified if it or the larger issuance of which it is a part is described on a list (e.g., $5 million principal amount of 12% debentures of ABC Savings and Loan Association due February 25, 1995, $3 million principal amount of 10% U.S. Treasury notes due May 28, 1990) of all registered obligations targeted to foreign markets held by or on behalf of
the person providing the certificate and the list is attached to, and incorporated by reference into, the certificate. The certificate must identify and provide the address of the person furnishing the certificate.
(D)
Payment to a depository of a clearing organization.
If the withholding agent pays interest to a depository of a clearing organization, then the clearing organization must provide the certificate described in this paragraph (e)(3)(i) to the withholding agent. Any certificate that is provided by a clearing organization must state that the clearing organization has received a statement from each member which complies with the provisions of this paragraph (e)(3)(i) and of paragraph (e)(4) of this section (as if the clearing organization were the withholding agent and regardless of whether the member is a financial institution described in section 871(h)(5)(B)).
(E)
Statement in lieu of Form W-8.
Subject to the requirements set out in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, a certificate or statement in the form described in this paragraph (e)(3)(i), in conjunction with the next annual certificate or statement, will serve as the certificate that may be provided in lieu of a Form W-8 with respect to interest on all foreign-targeted registered obligations held by the person making the certification or statement and which is paid to such person within the period beginning on the date of the certificate and ending on the date the next certificate is required to be provided.
(F)
Electronic transmission.
The certificate described in this paragraph (e)(3)(i) may be provided electronically under the terms and conditions of § 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(
3
)(
ii
).
(ii)
Payment to a person other than a financial institution or member of a clearing organization.
If the withholding agent pays interest to the beneficial owner of an obligation that is neither a financial institution described in section 871(h)(5)(B) nor a member of a clearing organization, then such owner must provide the withholding agent a statement described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.
(4)
Applicable procedures regarding documentation
—(i)
Procedures applicable to certificates required under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section
—(A)
Time for providing certificate.
Where no previous certificate for foreign-targeted registered obligations has been provided to the withholding agent by the person providing the certificate under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, such certificate must be provided within the period beginning 90 days prior to the first interest payment date on which the person holds a foreign-targeted registered obligation. The withholding agent may, in its discretion, withhold under section 1441(a), 1442(a), or 1443 if the certificate is not received by the date 30 days prior to the interest payment. Thereafter the certificate must be filed within the period beginning on January 15 and ending January 31 of each year. If a certificate provided pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) is provided during the period beginning on January 15 and ending on January 31 of any year, then no other certificate need be provided during such period in such year.
(B)
Change of status notification on Form W-9.
If, on any interest payment date after the obligation was acquired by the person making the certification, the beneficial owner of the obligation is a U.S. person, then the person to whom the withholding agent pays interest must furnish the withholding agent with a U.S. beneficial ownership notification within 30 days after such interest payment date. A U.S. beneficial ownership notification must include a statement that the beneficial owner of the obligation has been a U.S. person on an interest payment date (identifying such date), that such owner has provided to the person providing the notification a Form W-9 (or a substitute form that is substantially similar to Form W-9 and completed under penalties of perjury), and that the person providing the notification has been and will be complying with the information reporting requirements of section 6049, if applicable.
(C)
Alternative notification statement.
Where the person providing the notification described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section is neither a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957(a), nor a foreign corporation 50-percent or more of the gross income of which from all
sources for the three-year period ending with the close of the taxable year preceding the date of the statement was effectively connected with the conduct of trade or business in the United States, such person must attach to the notification a copy of the Form W-9 (or substitute form that is substantially similar to Form W-9 and completed under penalties of perjury) provided by the beneficial owner. When a person that provides the U.S. beneficial ownership notification does not attach to it a copy of such Form W-9 (or substitute form that is substantially similar to Form W-9 and completed under penalties of perjury), such person must state that it is either a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957(a), or a foreign corporation 50-percent or more of the gross income of which from all sources for the three-year period ending with the close of its taxable year preceding the date of the statement was effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. A withholding agent that receives a Form W-9 (or a substitute form that is substantially similar to Form W-9 and completed under penalties of perjury) must send a copy of such form to the IRS, at such address as the IRS shall indicate, within 30 days after receiving it and must attach a statement that the Form W-9 or substitute form was provided pursuant to this paragraph (e)(4) with respect to a U.S. person that has owned a foreign-targeted registered obligation on one or more interest payment dates.
(D)
Failure to provide notification.
If either a Form W-9 (or a substitute form that is substantially similar to a Form W-9 and completed under penalties of perjury) or the statement described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(C) of this section is not attached to the U.S. beneficial ownership notification provided pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the withholding agent is required to withhold under section 1441, 1442, or 1443 on a payment of interest made after the withholding agent has received the notification unless such form or statement (or a statement that the beneficial owner of the obligation is no longer a U.S. person) is received before the interest payment date from the person who provided the notification (or transferee). If, during the period beginning on the next January 15 and ending on the next January 31, such person certifies as set out in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section (subject to paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section) then the withholding agent is not required to withhold during the year following such certification (unless such person again provides a U.S. beneficial ownership notification without attaching a Form W-9 or substitute form that is substantially similar to Form W-9 and completed under penalties of perjury or the statement described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(C) of this section).
(E)
Procedures for clearing organizations.
Within the period beginning 10 days before the end of the calendar quarter and ending on the last day of each calendar quarter, any clearing organization (including a clearing organization that is a withholding agent) relying on annual certificates or statements from its member organizations, as set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, must send each member organization having submitted such certificate or statement a reminder that the member organization must give the clearing organization a U.S. beneficial ownership notification in the circumstances described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section.
(F)
Retention of certificates.
The certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section must be retained in the records of the withholding agent for four years from the end of the calendar year in which it was received. The statement described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section that is received by a clearing organization from a member organization must be retained in the records of the clearing organization for four years from the end of the calendar year in which it was received.
(G)
No reporting requirement.
The withholding agent who receives the certificate described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is not required to file Form 1042S to report payments under § 1.1461-1 (b) or (c) of interest that are made with respect to foreign-targeted registered obligations held by the person providing the certificate
and are made within the period beginning with the certificate date and ending on the last date for filing the next certificate.
(ii)
Procedures regarding certificates required under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section
—(A)
Time for providing certificate.
The statement described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section must be provided to the withholding agent within the period beginning 90 days prior to and ending on the first interest payment date on which the withholding agent pays interest to the beneficial owner. The withholding agent may, in its discretion, withhold under section 1441(a), 1442(a), or 1443 if the statement is not received by the date 30 days prior to the interest payment. The beneficial owner must confirm to the withholding agent the continuing validity of the documentary evidence within the period beginning 90 days prior to the first day of the third calendar year following the provision of such evidence and during the same period every three years thereafter while the owner still owns the obligation. The withholding agent who receives the statement described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is not required to report payments of interest under § 1.1461-1(b) or (c) if the payments are made with respect to foreign-targeted registered obligations held by the person who provides the statement and are made within the period beginning with the date on which the statement is provided and ending on the last date for confirming the validity of the statement. The statement received for purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is subject to the applicable procedures set forth in § 1.1441-1(e)(4).
(B)
Change of status notification on Form W-9.
If on any interest payment date after the obligation was acquired by the person providing the statement described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the beneficial owner of the obligation is a U.S. person, then the beneficial owner must so inform the withholding agent within 30 days after such interest payment date and must provide a Form W-9 (or substitute form that is substantially similar completed under penalties of perjury) to the withholding agent. However, the beneficial owner is not required to provide another Form W-9 (or substitute form that is substantially similar and completed under penalties of perjury) if such person has already provided it to the withholding agent within the same calendar year.
(iii)
Disqualification of documentation.
In accordance with the provisions of section 871(h)(4), the Secretary may make a determination in appropriate cases that a certificate or statement by any person, or class of persons, does not satisfy the requirements of that section. Should that determination be made, all payments of interest that otherwise qualify as portfolio interest to that person would become subject to 30-percent withholding under section 1441(a), 1442(a), or 1443.
(5)
Information reporting.
See § 1.6049-5(b)(7) for special information reporting rules applicable to interest on foreign-targeted registered obligations. See § 1.6045-1(g)(1)(ii) for information reporting rules applicable to the redemption, retirement, or sale of foreign-targeted registered obligations.
(f)
Securities lending transactions.
For applicable rules regarding substitute interest payments received pursuant to a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction, see §§ 1.871-7(b)(2) and 1.881-2(b)(2).
(g)
Portfolio interest not to include interest received by 10-percent shareholders
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 871(h), the term
portfolio interest
shall not include any interest received by a 10-percent shareholder.
(2)
Ten-percent shareholder
—(i)
In general.
The term
10-percent shareholder
means—
(A) In the case of an obligation issued by a corporation, any person who owns 10-percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote; or
(B) In the case of an obligation issued by a partnership, any person who owns 10-percent or more of the capital or profits interest in such partnership.
(ii)
Ownership
—(A)
Stock ownership.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this section,
stock owned
means stock directly or indirectly owned and stock owned by reason of the attribution rules of section 318(a), as modified by section 871(h)(3)(C).
(B)
Ownership of partnership interest.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section, rules similar to the rules in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section shall be applied in determining the ownership of a capital or profits interest in a partnership.
(3)
Application of 10-percent shareholder test to partners receiving interest through a partnership
—(i)
Partner level test.
Whether interest paid to a partnership and included in the distributive share of a partner that is a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation is received by a 10 percent shareholder shall be determined by applying the rules of this paragraph (g) only at the partner level.
(ii)
Time at which 10-percent shareholder test is applied.
The determination of whether a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation that is a partner in a partnership is a 10-percent shareholder under the rules of section 871(h)(3), section 881(c)(3), and this paragraph (g) with respect to interest paid to such partnership shall be made at the time that the withholding agent, absent the provisions of section 871(h), 881(c) and the rules of this paragraph, would otherwise be required to withhold under sections 1441 and 1442 with respect to such interest. For example, in the case of U.S. source interest paid by a domestic corporation to a domestic partnership or withholding foreign partnership (as defined in § 1.1441-5(c)(2)), the 10-percent shareholder test is applied when any distributions that include the interest are made to a foreign partner and, to the extent that a foreign partner's distributive share of the interest has not actually been distributed, on the earlier of the date that the statement required under section 6031(b) is mailed or otherwise provided to such partner, or the due date for furnishing such statement. See § 1.1441-5(b)(2) and (c)(2)(iii).
(4)
Application of 10-percent shareholder test to interest paid to a simple trust or grantor trust.
Whether interest paid to a simple trust or grantor trust and distributed to or included in the gross income of a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation that is a beneficiary or owner of such trust, as the case may be, is received by a 10-percent shareholder shall be determined by applying the rules of this paragraph (g) only at the beneficiary or owner level. The 10-percent shareholder test is applied with respect to a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation that is a beneficiary of a simple trust or an owner of a grantor trust at the time that a withholding agent, absent any exceptions, would otherwise be required to withhold under sections 1441 and 1442 with respect to such interest.
(h)
Portfolio interest not to include certain contingent interest
—(1)
Dividend equivalents.
Contingent interest does not qualify as portfolio interest to the extent that the interest is a dividend equivalent within the meaning of section 871(m).
(2)
Amount of dividend equivalent that is not portfolio interest.
The amount that does not qualify as portfolio interest because it is a dividend equivalent equals the amount of the dividend equivalent determined pursuant to § 1.871-15(j). Unless otherwise excluded pursuant to section 871(h), any other interest paid on an obligation that is not a dividend equivalent may qualify as portfolio interest.
(i)

§ 1.871-15
Treatment of dividend equivalents.
(a)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings described in this paragraph (a).
(1)
Broker.
A
broker
is a broker within the meaning provided in section 6045(c), except that the term does not include any corporation that is a broker solely because it regularly redeems its own shares.
(2)
Dealer.
A
dealer
is a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1).
(3)
Dividend.
A
dividend
is a dividend as described in section 316 (even if there is no actual distribution of cash or property).
(4)
Equity-linked instrument.
An
equity-linked instrument
(
ELI
) is a financial transaction, other than a securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction or an NPC, that references the value of one or more underlying securities. For example, a futures contract, forward contract, option, debt instrument, or other contractual arrangement that references the value of one or more underlying securities is an ELI.
(5)
Initial hedge.
An
initial hedge
is the number of underlying security shares that a short party would need to fully hedge an NPC or ELI (whether the NPC or ELI is a complex contract or a simple contract benchmark (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(2) of this section), as appropriate) with respect to an underlying security at the calculation time for the NPC or ELI, even if the short party does not in fact fully hedge the NPC or ELI.
(6)
Issue.
An NPC or ELI is treated as issued at inception, original issuance, or at the time of an issuance as a result of a deemed exchange pursuant to section 1001.
(7)
Notional principal contract.
A
notional principal contract
(
NPC
) is a notional principal contract as defined in § 1.446-3(c).
(8)
Option.
An
option
includes an option embedded in any debt instrument, forward contract, NPC, or other potential section 871(m) transaction.
(9)
Parties to the transaction
—(i)
Long party.
A
long party
is the party to a potential section 871(m) transaction with respect to an underlying security that would be entitled to receive a payment of a dividend equivalent (within the meaning of paragraph (i) of this section) described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii)
Short party.
A
short party
is the party to a potential section 871(m) transaction with respect to an underlying security that would be obligated to make a payment of a dividend equivalent (within the meaning of paragraph (i) of this section) described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(iii)
Party to the transaction.
A
party to the transaction
is any person that is a long party or a short party to a potential section 871(m) transaction, any agent acting on behalf of the long party or short party, or any person acting as an intermediary with respect to the potential section 871(m) transaction.
(iv)
Party to the transaction that is both a long party and a short party
—(A)
In general.
If a potential section 871(m) transaction references more than one underlying security, the long party and short party are determined separately with respect to each underlying security. A party to a potential section 871(m) transaction is both a long party and a short party when the party is entitled to a payment that references a dividend payment on an underlying security and the same party is obligated to make a payment that references a dividend payment on another underlying security pursuant to the potential section 871(m) transaction.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates the definitions in paragraph (a)(9) of this section:

# Example.
(i) Stock X and Stock Y are underlying securities. A and B enter into an NPC that entitles A to receive payments from B based on any appreciation in the value of Stock X and dividends paid on Stock X during the term of the contract and obligates A to make payments to B based on any depreciation in the value of Stock X during the term of the contract. In return, the NPC entitles B to receive payments from A based on any appreciation in the value of Stock Y and dividends paid on Stock Y during the term of the contract and obligates B to make payments to A based on any depreciation in the value of Stock Y during the term of the contract.
(ii) A is the long party with respect to Stock X, and the short party with respect to Stock Y. B is the long party with respect to Stock Y, and the short party with respect to Stock X.
(10)
Payment.
A
payment
has the meaning provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
(11)
Reference.
To
reference
means to be contingent upon or determined by reference to, directly or indirectly, whether in whole or in part.
(12)
Section 871(m) transaction and potential section 871(m) transaction.
A
section 871(m) transaction
is any securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction, specified NPC, or specified ELI. A
potential section 871(m) transaction
is any securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction, NPC, or ELI that references one or more underlying securities.
(13)
Securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction.
A
securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction
is any securities lending transaction, sale-repurchase transaction, or substantially similar transaction that references an underlying security.
Securities lending transaction
and
sale-repurchase transaction
have the same meaning as provided in § 1.861-3(a)(6).
(14)
Simple contracts and complex contracts
— (i)
Simple contract.
A
simple contract
is an NPC or ELI for which, with respect to each underlying security, all amounts to be paid or received on maturity, exercise, or any other payment determination date are calculated by reference to a single, fixed number of shares (as determined in paragraph (j)(3) of this section) of the underlying security, provided that the number of shares can be ascertained at the calculation time for the contract, and there is a single maturity or exercise date with respect to which all amounts (other than any upfront payment or any periodic payments) are required to be calculated with respect to the underlying security. For purposes of this section, a contract that provides an adjustment to the number of shares of the underlying security for a merger, stock split, cash dividend, or similar corporate action that affects all holders of the underlying securities proportionately will not cease to be treated as referencing a single, fixed number of shares solely as a result of that provision. A contract has a single exercise date even though it may be exercised by the holder at any time on or before the stated expiration of the contract. An NPC or ELI that includes a term that discontinuously increases or decreases the amount paid or received (such as a digital option), or that accelerates or extends the maturity is not a simple contract. A simple contract that is an NPC is a
simple NPC.
A simple contract that is an ELI is a
simple ELI.
(ii)
Complex contract
—(A)
In general.
A
complex contract
is any NPC or ELI that is not a simple contract. A complex contract that is an NPC is a
complex NPC.
A complex contract that is an ELI is a
complex ELI.
(B)
Example.
An ELI entitles the long party to a return equal to 200 percent of the appreciation on 100 shares of Stock X, and obligates the long party to pay an amount equal to the actual depreciation on 100 shares of Stock X. Pursuant to paragraph (j)(3) of the section, the ELI references 200 shares when Stock X appreciates, but only 100 shares when Stock X depreciates. Because the ELI does not provide the long party with an amount that is calculated by reference to a single, fixed number of shares of Stock X on the maturity date that can be ascertained at the calculation time, it is not a simple ELI.More specifically, upon maturity the ELI will either entitle the long party to receive a payment that is, in substance, measured by reference to 200 shares of stock or obligate the long party to make a payment measured by
reference to 100 shares of stock. The ELI is a complex ELI because it is not a simple ELI.
(15)
Underlying security.
An
underlying security
is any interest in an entity if that interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend pursuant to § 1.861-3, where applicable taking into account paragraph (m) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, if a potential section 871(m) transaction references an interest in more than one entity described in the preceding sentence or different interests in the same entity, each referenced interest is a separate underlying security for purposes of applying the rules of this section.
(b)
Source of a dividend equivalent.
A dividend equivalent is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 892, 894, and 4948(a), and chapters 3 and 4 of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code.
(c)
Dividend equivalent
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section,
dividend equivalent
means—
(i) Any payment that references a dividend from an underlying security pursuant to a securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction;
(ii) Any payment that references a dividend from an underlying security pursuant to a specified NPC described in paragraph (d) of this section;
(iii) Any payment that references a dividend from an underlying security pursuant to a specified ELI described in paragraph (e) of this section; and
(iv) Any other substantially similar payment as described in paragraph (f) of this section.
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
Not a dividend.
A payment that references a distribution with respect to an underlying security is not a dividend equivalent to the extent that the distribution would not be subject to tax pursuant to section 871(a) or section 881 if the long party owned the underlying security. For example, if an NPC references stock in a regulated investment company that pays a dividend that includes a capital gains dividend described in section 852(b)(3)(C) that would not be subject to tax under section 871(a) or section 881 if paid directly to the long party, then an NPC payment is not a dividend equivalent to the extent that it is determined by reference to the capital gains dividend.
(ii)
Section 305 coordination.
A dividend equivalent received by a long party, who is a shareholder as defined in § 1.305-1(d) of an instrument that gives rise to a dividend pursuant to sections 305(b) and (c) (including a debt instrument that is convertible into shares of stock and stock that is convertible into shares of another class of stock) that is also a section 871(m) transaction, is reduced by any amount treated as a dividend by sections 305(b) and (c) to the long party. For other section 871(m) transactions that reference an underlying security that is an instrument treated as paying a dividend pursuant to sections 305(b) and (c) and for which the long party is not a shareholder as defined in § 1.305-1(d), the dividend equivalent received by the long party with respect to the section 871(m) transaction includes (and is not reduced by) any amount treated as a dividend pursuant to sections 305(b) and (c).
(iii)
Due bills.
A dividend equivalent does not include a payment made pursuant to a due bill arising from the actions of a securities exchange that apply to all transactions in the stock with respect to the dividend. For purposes of this section, a stock will be considered to trade with a due bill only when the relevant securities exchange has set an ex-dividend date with respect to a dividend that occurs after the record date.
(iv)
Payments made pursuant to annuity, endowment, and life insurance contracts
—(A)
Insurance contracts issued by domestic insurance companies.
A payment made pursuant to a contract that is an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract issued by a domestic corporation (including its foreign or U.S. possession branch) that is a life insurance company described in section 816(a) does not include a dividend equivalent if the payment is subject to tax under section 871(a) or section 881.
(B)
Insurance contracts issued by foreign insurance companies.
A payment does not include a dividend equivalent if it is made pursuant to a contract that is an annuity, endowment, or life
insurance contract issued by a foreign corporation that would be subject to tax under subchapter L if it were a domestic corporation.
(C)
Insurance contracts held by foreign insurance companies.
A payment made pursuant to a policy of insurance (including a policy of reinsurance) does not include a dividend equivalent if it is made to a foreign corporation that would be subject to tax under subchapter L if it were a domestic corporation.
(v)
Certain payments pursuant to employee compensation arrangements.
A dividend equivalent does not include the portion of equity-based compensation for personal services of a nonresident alien individual that is—
(A) Wages subject to withholding under section 3402 and the regulations under that section;
(B) Excluded from the definition of wages under § 31.3401(a)(6)-1; or
(C) Exempt from withholding under § 1.1441-4(b).
(d)
Specified NPCs
—(1)
Specified NPCs entered into before January 1, 2017
—(i)
In general.
For payments made after March 18, 2012, and before January 1, 2017, a specified NPC is any NPC if—
(A) In connection with entering into the contract, any long party to the contract transfers the underlying security to any short party to the contract;
(B) In connection with the termination of the contract, any short party to the contract transfers the underlying security to any long party to the contract;
(C) The underlying security is not readily tradable on an established securities market; or
(D) In connection with entering into the contract, the underlying security is posted as collateral by any short party to the contract with any long party to the contract.
(ii)
Specified NPC status as of January 1, 2017.
An NPC that is treated as a specified NPC pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section will remain a specified NPC on or after January 1, 2017.
(2)
Specified NPCs on or after January 1, 2017
—(i)
Simple NPCs.
A simple NPC that has a delta of 0.8 or greater with respect to an underlying security at the calculation time for the NPC is a specified NPC.
(ii)
Complex NPCs.
A complex NPC that meets the substantial equivalence test described in paragraph (h) of this section with respect to an underlying security at the calculation time for the NPC is a specified NPC.
(e)
Specified ELIs
—(1)
Simple ELIs.
A simple ELI that has a delta of 0.8 or greater with respect to an underlying security at the calculation time for the ELI is a specified ELI.
(2)
Complex ELIs.
A complex ELI that meets the substantial equivalence test described in paragraph (h) of this section with respect to an underlying security at the calculation time for the ELI is a specified ELI.
(f)
Other substantially similar payments.
For purposes of this section, any payment made in satisfaction of a tax liability of the long party with respect to a dividend equivalent by a withholding agent is a dividend equivalent received by the long party. The amount of that dividend equivalent constitutes additional income to the payee to the extent provided in § 1.1441-3(f)(1).
(g)
Delta
—(1)
In general.
Delta is the ratio of the change in the fair market value of an NPC or ELI to a small change in the fair market value of the number of shares of the underlying security (as determined under paragraph (j)(3) of this section) referenced by the NPC or ELI. If an NPC or ELI contains more than one reference to a single underlying security, all references to that underlying security are taken into account in determining the delta with respect to that underlying security. If an NPC or ELI references more than one underlying security or other property, the delta with respect to each underlying security must be determined without taking into account any other underlying security or property. The delta of an equity derivative that is embedded in a debt instrument or other derivative is determined without taking into account changes in the market value of the debt instrument or other derivative that are not directly related to the equity element of the instrument. Thus, for example, the delta of an option embedded in a convertible note is determined without regard to the debt component of the convertible
note. For purposes of this section, delta must be determined in a commercially reasonable manner. If a taxpayer calculates delta for non-tax business purposes, that delta ordinarily is the delta used for purposes of this section.
(2)
Time for determining delta
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the delta of a potential section 871(m) transaction is determined at the calculation time for the potential section 871(m) transaction.
(ii)
Calculation time.
The calculation time for a potential section 871(m) transaction is the earlier of when the potential section 871(m) transaction is priced and when the potential section 871(m) transaction is issued. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the pricing time is more than 14 calendar days before the potential section 871(m) transaction is issued, the calculation time is when the potential section 871(m) transaction is issued.
(iii)
Pricing time.
A potential section 871(m) transaction is priced when all material economic terms for the transaction have been agreed upon, including the price at which the transaction is sold.
(3)
Simplified delta calculation for certain simple contracts that reference multiple underlying securities.
If an NPC or ELI references 10 or more underlying securities and an exchange-traded security (for example, an exchange-traded fund) is available that would fully hedge the NPC or ELI at the calculation time, the delta of the NPC or ELI may be calculated by determining the ratio of the change in the fair market value of the simple contract to a small change in the fair market value of the exchange-traded security. A delta determined under this paragraph (g)(3) must be used as the delta for each underlying security for purposes of calculating the amount of a dividend equivalent as provided in paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Delta calculation for listed options
—(i)
In general.
The delta of an option contract that is listed on a regulated exchange described in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section is the delta of that option at the close of business on the business day before the date of issuance. On the date an option contract is listed for the first time, the delta is the delta of that option at the close of business on the date of issuance. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, the delta of a listed option that is also a customized option is determined under the rules of paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Regulated exchange.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, a regulated exchange is any exchange that is either:
(A) Described in paragraph (l)(3)(vii) of this section; or
(B)
Foreign securities exchange
—(
1
)
In general
. A foreign securities exchange that:
(
i
) Is regulated or supervised by a governmental authority of the country in which the market is located;
(
ii
) Has trading volume, listing, financial disclosure, surveillance, and other requirements designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open, fair and orderly market, and to protect investors, and the laws of the country in which the exchange is located and the rules of the exchange ensure that those requirements are actually enforced;
(
iii
) Has rules that effectively promote active trading of listed options on the exchange; and
(
iv
) Has an average daily trading volume on the exchange exceeding $10 billion notional amount during the immediately preceding calendar year.
(
2
)
Application to an exchange with more than one tier or market.
If an exchange in a foreign country has more than one tier or market level on which listed options may be separately listed or traded, each tier or market level is treated as a separate exchange.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (g). For purposes of these examples, Stock X and Stock Y are common stock of domestic corporations X and Y. LP is the long party to the transaction.

# Example 1.
Delta calculation for an NPC.
The terms of an NPC require LP to pay the short party an amount equal to all of the depreciation in the value of 100 shares of Stock X and an interest-rate based return. In return, the
NPC requires the short party to pay LP an amount equal to all of the appreciation in the value of 100 shares of Stock X and any dividends paid by X on those shares. The value of the NPC will change by $1 for each $0.01 change in the price of a share of Stock X. When LP entered into the NPC, Stock X had a fair market value of $50 per share. The NPC therefore has a delta of 1.0 ($1.00/($0.01 × 100)).

# Example 2.
Delta calculation for an option.
LP purchases a call option that references 100 shares of Stock Y. At the time LP purchases the call option, the value of the option is expected to change by $0.30 for a $0.01 change in the price of a share of Stock Y. When LP purchases the option, Stock Y has a fair market value of $100 per share. The call option has a delta of 0.3 ($0.30/($0.01 × 100)).
(h)
Substantial equivalence test
—(1)
In general.
The substantial equivalence test described in this paragraph (h) applies to determine whether a complex contract is a section 871(m) transaction. The substantial equivalence test assesses whether a complex contract substantially replicates the economic performance of the underlying security by comparing, at various testing prices for the underlying security, the differences between the expected changes in value of that complex contract and its initial hedge with the differences between the expected changes in value of a simple contract benchmark (as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section) and its initial hedge. If the complex contract contains more than one reference to a single underlying security, all references to that underlying security are taken into account for purposes of applying the substantial equivalence test with respect to that underlying security. With respect to an equity derivative that is embedded in a debt instrument or other derivative, the substantial equivalence test is applied to the complex contract without taking into account changes in the market value of the debt instrument or other derivative that are not directly related to the equity element of the instrument. The complex contract is a section 871(m) transaction with respect to an underlying security if, for that underlying security, the expected change in value of the complex contract and its initial hedge is equal to or less than the expected change in value of the simple contract benchmark and its initial hedge when the substantial equivalence test described in this paragraph (h) is calculated at the calculation time for the complex contract. To the extent that the steps of the substantial equivalence test set out in this paragraph (h) cannot be applied to a particular complex contract, a taxpayer must use the principles of the substantial equivalence test to reasonably determine whether the complex contract is a section 871(m) transaction with respect to each underlying security. For purposes of this section, the test must be applied and the inputs must be determined in a commercially reasonable manner. The term of the simple contract benchmark must be, and the inputs must use, a reasonable time period, consistently applied (for example, in determining the standard deviation and probability). If a taxpayer calculates any relevant input for non-tax business purposes, that input ordinarily is the input used for purposes of this section.
(2)
Simple contract benchmark.
The simple contract benchmark is an actual or hypothetical simple contract that, at the calculation time for the complex contract, has a delta of 0.8, references the applicable underlying security referenced by the complex contract, and has terms that are consistent with all the material terms of the complex contract, including the maturity date. If an actual simple contract does not exist, the taxpayer must create a hypothetical simple contract. Depending on the complex contract, the simple contract benchmark might be, for example, a call option, a put option, or a collar.
(3)
Substantial equivalence.
A complex contract is a section 871(m) transaction with respect to an underlying security if the complex contract calculation described in paragraph (h)(4) of this section results in an amount that is equal to or less than the amount of the benchmark calculation described in paragraph (h)(5) of this section.
(4)
Complex contract calculation
—(i)
In general.
The complex contract calculation for each underlying security referenced by a potential section 871(m) transaction that is a complex contract is computed by:
(A) Determining the change in value (as described in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section) of the complex contract with respect to the underlying security at each testing price (as described in paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section);
(B) Determining the change in value of the initial hedge for the complex contract at each testing price;
(C) Determining the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the complex contract determined in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(A) of this section and the change in value of the initial hedge determined in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(B) of this section at each testing price;
(D) Determining the probability (as described in paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section) associated with each testing price;
(E) Multiplying the absolute value for each testing price determined in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(C) of this section by the corresponding probability for that testing price determined in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(D) of this section;
(F) Adding the product of each calculation determined in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(E) of this section; and
(G) Dividing the sum determined in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(F) of this section by the initial hedge for the complex contract.
(ii)
Determining the change in value.
The change in value of a complex contract is the difference between the value of the complex contract with respect to the underlying security at the calculation time for the complex contract and the value of the complex contract with respect to the underlying security if the price of the underlying security were equal to the testing price at the calculation time for the complex contract. The change in value of the initial hedge of a complex contract with respect to the underlying security is the difference between the value of the initial hedge at the calculation time for the complex contract and the value of the initial hedge if the price of the underlying security were equal to the testing price at the calculation time for the complex contract.
(iii)
Testing price.
The testing prices must include the prices of the underlying security if the price of the underlying security at the calculation time for the complex contract were alternatively increased by one standard deviation and decreased by one standard deviation, each of which is a separate testing price. In circumstances where using only two testing prices is reasonably likely to provide an inaccurate measure of substantial equivalence, a taxpayer must use additional testing prices as necessary to determine whether a complex contract satisfies the substantial equivalence test. If additional testing prices are used for the substantial equivalence test, the probabilities as described in paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section must be adjusted accordingly.
(iv)
Probability.
For purposes of paragraphs (h)(4)(i)(D) and (E) of this section, the probability of an increase by one standard deviation is the measure of the likelihood that the price of the underlying security will increase by any amount from its price at the calculation time for the complex contract. For purposes of paragraphs (h)(4)(i)(D) and (E) of this section, the probability of a decrease by one standard deviation is the measure of the likelihood that the price of the underlying security will decrease by any amount from its price at the calculation time for the complex contract.
(5)
Benchmark calculation.
The benchmark calculation with respect to each underlying security referenced by the potential section 871(m) transaction is determined by using the computation methodology described in paragraph (h)(4) of this section with respect to a simple contract benchmark for the underlying security.
(6)
Substantial equivalence calculation for certain complex contracts that reference multiple underlying securities.
If a complex contract references 10 or more underlying securities and an exchange-traded security (for example, an exchange-traded fund) is available that would fully hedge the complex contract at its calculation time, the substantial equivalence calculations for the complex contract may be calculated by treating the exchange-traded security as the underlying security. When the exchange-traded security is used for the substantial equivalence calculation pursuant to this paragraph (h)(6), the initial hedge is the number of shares of
the exchange-traded security for purposes of calculating the amount of a dividend equivalent as provided in paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section.
(7)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (h) of this section. For purposes of this example, Stock X is common stock of domestic corporation X. FI is the financial institution that structures the transaction described in the example, and is the short party to the transaction. Investor is a nonresident alien individual.

# Example.
Complex contract that is not substantially equivalent.
(i) FI issues an investment contract (the Contract) that has a stated maturity of one year, and Investor purchases the Contract from FI at issuance for $10,000. At maturity, the Contract entitles Investor to a return of $10,000 (i) plus 200 percent of any appreciation in Stock X above $100 per share, capped at $110, on 100 shares or (ii) minus 100 percent of any depreciation in Stock X below $90 on 100 shares. At the calculation time for the Contract, the price of Stock X is $100 per share. Thus, for example, Investor will receive $11,000 if the price of Stock X is $105 per share at maturity of the Contract, but Investor will receive $9,000 if the price of Stock X is $80 per share when the Contract matures. At issuance, FI acquires 64 shares of Stock X to fully hedge the Contract issued to Investor. The calculation time for this example is the issuance.
(ii) The Contract references an underlying security and is not an NPC, so it is classified as an ELI under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. At the calculation time for the Contract, the Contract does not provide for an amount paid at maturity that is calculated by reference to a single, fixed number of shares of Stock X. When the Contract matures, the amount paid is effectively calculated based on either 200 shares of Stock X (if the price of Stock X has appreciated up to $110) or 100 shares of Stock X (if the price of Stock X has declined below $90). Consequently, the Contract is a complex contract described in paragraph (a)(14) of this section.
(iii) Because it is a complex ELI, FI applies the substantial equivalence test described in paragraph (h) of this section to determine whether the Contract is a specified ELI. FI determines that the price of Stock X would be $120 if the price of Stock X were increased by one standard deviation, and $79 if the price of Stock X were decreased by one standard deviation. Based on these results, FI next determines the change in value of the Contract to be $2000 at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation ($12,000 testing price minus $10,000 issue price) and a negative $1,100 at the testing price that represents a decrease by one standard deviation ($10,000 issue price minus $8,900 testing price). FI performs the same calculations for the 64 shares of Stock X that constitute the initial hedge, determining that the change in value of the initial hedge is $1,280 at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation ($6,400 at issuance compared to $7,680 at the testing price) and negative $1,344 at the testing price that represents a decrease by one standard deviation ($6,400 at issuance compared to $5,056 at the testing price).
(iv) FI then determines the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the Contract at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation and a decrease by one standard deviation. Increased by one standard deviation, the absolute value of the difference is $720 ($2,000-$1,280); decreased by one standard deviation, the absolute value of the difference is $244 (negative $1,100 minus negative $1,344). FI determines that there is a 52% chance that the price of Stock X will have increased in value when the Contract matures and a 48% chance that the price of Stock X will have decreased in value at that time. FI multiplies the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the Contract at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation by 52%, which equals $374.40. FI multiplies the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the Contract at the testing price that represents a decrease by one standard deviation by 48%, which equals $117.12. FI adds these two numbers and divides by the number of shares that constitute the initial hedge to determine that the transaction calculation is 7.68 ((374.40 plus 117.12) divided by 64).
(v) FI then performs the same calculation with respect to the simple contract benchmark, which is a one-year call option that references one share of Stock X, settles on the same date as the Contract, and has a delta of 0.8. The one-year call option has a strike price of $79 and has a cost (the purchase premium) of $22. The initial hedge for the one-year call option is 0.8 shares of Stock X.
(vi) FI first determines that the change in value of the simple contract benchmark is $19.05 if the testing price is increased by one standard deviation ($22.00 at issuance to $41.05 at the testing price) and negative $20.95 if the testing price is decreased by one standard deviation ($22.00 at issuance to $1.05 at the testing price). Second, FI determines that the change in value of the initial hedge is $16.00 at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation ($80 at
issuance to $96 at the testing price) and negative $16.80 at the testing price that represents a decrease by one standard deviation ($80.00 at issuance to $63.20 at the testing price).
(vii) FI determines the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the one-year call option at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation is $3.05 ($16.00 minus $19.05). FI next determines the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the option at the testing price that represents a decrease by one standard deviation is $4.15 (negative $16.80 minus negative $20.95). FI multiplies the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the option at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation by 52%, which equals $1.586. FI multiplies the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the option at the testing price that represents a decrease by one standard deviation by 48%, which equals $1.992. FI adds these two numbers and divides by the number of shares that constitute the initial hedge to determine that the benchmark calculation is 4.473 ((1.586 plus 1.992) divided by .8).
(viii) FI concludes that the Contract is not a section 871(m) transaction because the transaction calculation of 7.68 exceeds the benchmark calculation of 4.473.
(i)
Payment of a dividend equivalent
—(1)
Payments determined on gross basis.
For purposes of this section, a payment includes any gross amount that references a dividend and that is used in computing any net amount transferred to or from the long party even if the long party makes a net payment to the short party or no amount is paid because the net amount is zero.
(2)
Actual and estimated dividends
—(i)
In general.
A payment includes any amount that references an actual or estimated dividend, whether the reference is explicit or implicit. If a potential section 871(m) transaction provides for a payment based on an estimated dividend that adjusts to account for the amount of an actual dividend paid, the payment is treated as referencing the actual dividend amount and not an estimated dividend amount.
(ii)
Implicit dividends.
A payment includes an actual or estimated dividend that is implicitly taken into account in computing one or more of the terms of a potential section 871(m) transaction, including interest rate, notional amount, purchase price, premium, upfront payment, strike price, or any other amount paid or received pursuant to the potential section 871(m) transaction.
(iii)
Actual dividend presumption.
A short party to a section 871(m) transaction is treated as paying a per-share dividend amount equal to the actual dividend amount unless the short party to the section 871(m) transaction identifies a reasonable estimated dividend amount in writing at the calculation time. For this purpose, a reasonable estimated dividend amount stated in an offering document or the documents governing the terms at the calculation time will establish the estimated dividend amount. To qualify as an estimated dividend amount, the written estimated dividend amount must separately state the amount estimated for each anticipated dividend or state a formula that allows each dividend to be determined. If an underlying security is not expected to have a dividend, a reasonable estimate of the dividend amount may be zero.
(iv)
Additions to estimated payments.
If a section 871(m) transaction provides for any payment in addition to an estimated dividend and that additional payment is determined by reference to a dividend (for example, a special dividend), both the estimated dividend and the additional payment are used to determine the per-share dividend amount.
(3)
Dividends for certain baskets
—(i)
In general.
If a section 871(m) transaction references long positions in more than 25 underlying securities, the short party may treat the dividends with respect to the referenced underlying securities as paid at the end of the applicable calendar quarter to compute the per-share dividend amount.
(ii)
Publicly available dividend amount.
For purposes of paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section, if a section 871(m) transaction references the same underlying securities as a security (for example, stock in an exchange-traded fund) or index for which there is a publicly available quarterly dividend amount, the publicly available dividend amount may be used to determine the per-share dividend amount for the section 871(m)
transaction with any adjustment for special dividends.
(iii)
Dividend amount for a section 871(m) transaction using the simplified delta calculation.
When the delta of a section 871(m) transaction is determined under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the per-share dividend amount for that section 871(m) transaction must be determined using the dividend amount for the exchange-traded security that would fully hedge the section 871(m) transaction (whether or not the exchange-traded security is actually acquired).
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (i). For purposes of these examples, Stock X is common stock of Corporation X, a domestic corporation, that historically pays quarterly dividends on Stock X. The parties anticipate that Corporation X will continue to pay quarterly dividends.

# Example 1.
Forward contract to purchase domestic stock.
(i) When Stock X is trading at $50 per share, Foreign Investor enters into a forward contract to purchase 100 shares of Stock X in one year. Reasonable estimates of the quarterly dividend are specified in the transaction documents. The price in the forward contract is determined by multiplying the number of shares referenced in the contract by the current price of the shares and an interest rate, and subtracting the value of any dividends expected to be paid during the term of the contract. Assuming that the forward contract is priced using an interest rate of 4 percent and total estimated dividends with a future value of $1 per share during the term of the forward contract, the purchase price set in the forward contract is $5,100 (100 shares × $50 per share × 1.04 − ($1 × 100)).
(ii) Subject to paragraph (i)(2)(iv) of this section, the estimated dividend amounts are the per-share dividend amounts because the estimates are reasonable and specified in accordance with paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section. The estimated per-share dividend amounts are dividend equivalents for purposes of this section.

# Example 2.
Price return only swap contract.
(i) Foreign Investor enters into a price return swap contract that entitles Foreign Investor to receive payments based on the appreciation in the value of 100 shares of Stock X and requires Foreign Investor to pay an amount based on LIBOR plus any depreciation in the value of Stock X. The swap contract neither explicitly entitles Foreign Investor to payments based on dividends paid on Stock X during the term of the contract nor references an estimated dividend amount. The LIBOR rate in the swap contract, however, is reduced to reflect expected annual dividends on Stock X.
(ii) Because the LIBOR leg of the swap contract is reduced to reflect estimated dividends and the estimated dividend amounts are not specified, Foreign Investor is treated as receiving the actual dividend amounts are in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) of this section. The actual per-share dividend amounts are dividend equivalents for purposes of this section.
(j)
Amount of dividend equivalent
— (1)
Calculation of the amount of a dividend equivalent.
The long party is liable for tax on any dividend equivalents required to be determined pursuant to paragraph (j)(2) of this section only with respect to dividend equivalents that arise while the long party is a party to the transaction. The amount of any dividend equivalent is determined as follows:
(i)
Securities lending or sale-repurchase transactions.
For a securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction, the amount of the dividend equivalent for each dividend on an underlying security equals the amount of the actual per-share dividend paid on the underlying security multiplied by the number of shares of the underlying security.
(ii)
Simple contracts.
For a simple contract that is a section 871(m) transaction, the amount of the dividend equivalent for each dividend on an underlying security equals:
(A) The per-share dividend amount (as determined under either paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section) with respect to the underlying security multiplied by;
(B) The number of shares of the underlying security multiplied by;
(C) The delta of the section 871(m) transaction with respect to the underlying security.
(iii)
Complex contracts.
For a complex contract that is a section 871(m) transaction, the amount of the dividend equivalent for each dividend on an underlying security equals:
(A) The per-share dividend amount (as determined under paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section) with respect to the underlying security multiplied by;
(B) The initial hedge for the underlying security.
(iv)
Other substantially similar payments.
In addition to any amount determined pursuant to paragraph (j)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii), the amount of a dividend equivalent includes the amount of any payment described in paragraph (f) of this section.
(2)
Time for determining the amount of a dividend equivalent.
The amount of a dividend equivalent is determined on the earlier of the date that is the record date of the dividend and the day prior to the ex-dividend date with respect to the dividend. For example, if a specified NPC provides for a payment at settlement that takes into account an earlier dividend payment, the amount of the dividend equivalent is determined on the earlier of the record date or the day prior to the ex-dividend date for that dividend.
(3)
Number of shares.
The number of shares of an underlying security generally is the number of shares of the underlying security stated in the contract. If the transaction modifies that number by a factor or fraction or otherwise alters the amount of any payment, the number of shares is adjusted to take into account the factor, fraction, or other modification. For example, in a transaction in which the long party receives or makes payments based on 200 percent of the appreciation or depreciation (as applicable) of 100 shares of stock, the number of shares of the underlying security is 200 shares of the stock.
(4)
Taxable year of a dividend equivalent.
A long party is liable for tax on a dividend equivalent in the year the dividend equivalent is subject to withholding pursuant to § 1.1441-2(e)(7). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a long party that is a qualified derivatives dealer is liable for tax on a dividend equivalent when the applicable dividend on the underlying security would be subject to withholding pursuant to § 1.1441-2(e)(4). The amount of the long party's tax liability, however, is determined by reference to the amount that would have been due at the time the dividend equivalent amount is determined pursuant to paragraph (j)(2) of this section based on the beneficial owners at that time (for example, based on the tax rate at that time, whether the long party qualified for a treaty benefit at that time, and in the case of a partnership, based on the partners at that time).
(k)
Limitation on the treatment of certain corporate acquisitions as section 871(m) transactions.
A potential section 871(m) transaction is not a section 871(m) transaction with respect to an underlying security if the transaction obligates the long party to acquire ownership of the underlying security as part of a plan pursuant to which one or more persons (including the long party) are obligated to acquire underlying securities representing more than 50 percent of the value of the entity issuing the underlying securities.
(l)
Rules relating to indices
—(1)
Purpose.
The purpose of this paragraph (l) is to provide a safe harbor for potential section 871(m) transactions that reference certain passive indices that are based on a diverse basket of publicly-traded securities and that are widely used by numerous market participants. Notwithstanding any other provision in this paragraph (l), an index is not a qualified index if treating the index as a qualified index would be contrary to the purpose described in this paragraph (l)(1).
(2)
Qualified index not treated as an underlying security
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, a qualified index is treated as a single security that is not an underlying security. The determination of whether an index referenced in a potential section 871(m) transaction is a qualified index is made at the calculation time for the transaction based on whether the index is a qualified index on the first business day of the calendar year containing the calculation time.
(ii)
Rule for the first year of an index.
In the case of an index that was not in existence on the first business day of the calendar year containing the calculation time for the transaction, paragraph (l)(2) of this section is applied by testing the index on the first business day it is created, and the dividend yield calculation required by paragraph (l)(3)(vi) of this section is determined by using the dividend yield that the index would have had in the immediately preceding year if it had the same components throughout that year that it has on the day it is created.
(3)
Qualified index.
A
qualified index
means an index that—
(i) References 25 or more component securities (whether or not the security is an underlying security);
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section, references only long positions in component securities;
(iii) References no component underlying security that represents more than 15 percent of the weighting of the component securities in the index;
(iv) References no five or fewer component underlying securities that together represent more than 40 percent of the weighting of the component securities in the index;
(v) Is modified or rebalanced only according to publicly stated, predefined criteria, which may require interpretation by the index provider or a board or committee responsible for maintaining the index;
(vi) Did not provide an annual dividend yield in the immediately preceding calendar year from component underlying securities that is greater than 1.5 times the annual dividend yield of the S
P 500 Index as reported for the immediately preceding calendar year; and
(vii) Is traded through futures contracts or option contracts (regardless of whether the contracts provide price only or total return exposure to the index or provide for dividend reinvestment in the index) on—
(A) A national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or a domestic board of trade designated as a contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; or
(B) A foreign exchange or board of trade that is a qualified board or exchange as determined by the Secretary pursuant to section 1256(g)(7)(C) or that has a staff no action letter from the CFTC permitting direct access from the United States that is effective on the applicable testing date, provided that the referenced component underlying securities, in the aggregate, comprise less than 50 percent of the weighting of the component securities in the index.
(4)
Safe harbor for certain indices that reference assets other than underlying securities.
Notwithstanding paragraph (l)(3) of this section, an index is a qualified index if the index is widely traded, the referenced component underlying securities in the aggregate comprise 10 percent or less of the weighting of the component securities in the index, and the index was not formed or availed of with a principal purpose of avoiding U.S. withholding tax.
(5)
Weighting of component securities.
For purposes of this paragraph (l), the weighting of a component security of an index is the percentage of the index's value represented, or accounted for, by the component security.
(6)
Transactions that reference a qualified index and one or more component securities or indices
—(i)
In general.
When a potential section 871(m) transaction references a qualified index and one or more component securities or other indices, the qualified index remains a qualified index only if the potential section 871(m) transaction does not reference a short position in any referenced component security of the qualified index, other than a short position with respect to the entire qualified index (for example, a cap or floor) or a de minimis short position described in paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section. If, in connection with a potential section 871(m) transaction that references a qualified index, a taxpayer (or a related person within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)) enters into one or more transactions that reduce exposure to any referenced component security of the index, other than transactions that reduce exposure to the entire index, then the potential section 871(m) transaction is not treated as referencing a qualified index.
(ii)
Safe harbor for de minimis short positions.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (l)(3)(ii) and (l)(6)(i) of this section, an index may be a qualified index if the short position (whether part of the index or entered into separately by the taxpayer or related person within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)) reduces exposure to referenced component securities of a qualified index (excluding any short positions with respect to the entire qualified index) by five percent or less of the value of the long positions in component securities in the qualified index.
(7)
Transactions that indirectly reference a qualified index.
If a potential section 871(m) transaction references an exchange-traded fund that tracks a qualified index, the potential section 871(m) transaction will be treated as referencing a qualified index.
(m)
Rules relating to derivatives that reference partnerships
—(1)
In general.
When a potential section 871(m) transaction references a partnership interest, the assets of the partnership will be treated as referenced by the potential section 871(m) transaction only if the partnership carries on a trade or business of dealing or trading in securities, holds significant investments in securities (either of which is a covered partnership), or directly or indirectly holds an interest in a lower-tier partnership that is a covered partnership. For purposes of this section, if a covered partnership directly or indirectly holds assets that are underlying securities or potential section 871(m) transactions, any potential section 871(m) transaction that references an interest in the covered partnership is treated as referencing the shares of the underlying securities, including underlying securities of potential section 871(m) transactions, directly or indirectly allocable to that partnership interest. For purposes of this paragraph (m), a security is defined in section 475(c).
(2)
Significant investments in securities
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (m), a partnership holds significant investments in securities if either—
(A) 25 percent or more of the value of the partnership's assets consist of underlying securities or potential section 871(m) transactions; or
(B) The value of the underlying securities or potential section 871(m) transactions equals or exceeds $25 million.
(ii)
Determining the value of the partnership's assets.
For purposes of this paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section, the value of a partnership's assets is determined at the calculation time for the potential section 871(m) transaction referencing that partnership interest based on the value of the assets held by the partnership on the last day of the partnership's prior taxable year unless the long party or the short party has actual knowledge that a subsequent transaction has caused the partnership to cross either of the thresholds described in paragraph (m)(2)(i). The value of a partnership's assets is equal to their fair market value, except that the value of any NPC, futures contract, forward contract, option, and any similar financial instrument held by the partnership is deemed to be the value of the notional securities referenced by the transaction.
(n)
Combined transactions
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of determining whether a potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction, two or more potential section 871(m) transactions are treated as a single transaction with respect to an underlying security when—
(i) A person (or a related person within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)) is the long party with respect to the underlying security for each potential section 871(m) transaction;
(ii) The potential section 871(m) transactions reference the same underlying security;
(iii) The potential section 871(m) transactions, when combined, replicate the economics of a transaction that would be a section 871(m) transaction if the transactions had been entered into as a single transaction; and
(iv) The potential section 871(m) transactions are entered into in connection with each other (regardless of whether the transactions are entered into simultaneously or with the same counterparty).
(2)
Section 871(m) transactions.
If a potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction, either by itself or as a result of a combination with one or more other potential section 871(m) transactions, it does not cease to be a section 871(m) transaction as a result of applying paragraph (n) of this section or disposing of one or more of the potential section 871(m) transaction with which it is combined.
(3)
Short party presumptions regarding combined transactions
—(i)
In general.
If a short party relies on the presumption provided in paragraph (n)(3)(ii) of this section or in paragraph (n)(3)(iii) of this section, the short party is not required to treat those potential section 871(m) transactions as part of a single
transaction pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Transactions in separate accounts.
A short party that is a broker may presume that transactions are not entered into in connection with each other for purposes of paragraph (n)(1) of this section if a long party holds or reflects the transactions in separate accounts maintained by the short party, unless the short party has actual knowledge that the transactions held or reflected in separate accounts by the long party were entered into in connection with each other or that separate accounts were created or used to avoid section 871(m).
(iii)
Transactions separated by at least two business days.
A short party that is a broker may presume that transactions entered into two or more business days apart are not entered into in connection with each other for purposes of paragraph (n)(1) of this section unless the short party has actual knowledge that the transactions were entered into in connection with each other.
(4)
Presumptions Commissioner will apply to long party
—(i)
Transactions in separate trading books.
The Commissioner will presume that a long party did not enter into two or more transactions in connection with each other for purposes of paragraph (n)(1) of this section if the long party properly reflected those transactions on separate trading books. The Commissioner may rebut this presumption with facts and circumstances showing that transactions reflected on separate trading books were entered into in connection with each other or that separate trading books were created or used to avoid section 871(m).
(ii)
Transactions separated by at least two days.
The Commissioner will presume that a long party did not enter into two or more transactions in connection with each other for purposes of paragraph (n)(1) of this section if the long party entered into the transactions two or more business days apart. The Commissioner may rebut this presumption with facts and circumstances showing that the transactions entered into two or more business days apart were entered into in connection with each other.
(iii)
Transactions separated by fewer than two days and reflected in the same trading book.
The Commissioner will presume that transactions that are entered into fewer than two business days apart and reflected on the same trading book are entered into in connection with each other. A long party can rebut this presumption with facts and circumstances showing that the transactions were not entered into in connection with each other.
(5)
Rules of application
—(i)
Two business days rule.
For the purpose of determining the number of business days between transactions, the short party may, and the Commissioner will, assume that all transactions are entered into at 4:00 p.m. on the date the transaction becomes effective in the jurisdiction of the long party.
(ii)
No long party presumptions.
Notwithstanding the presumptions described in paragraphs (n)(3) and (n)(4) of this section, the long party must treat two or more transactions as combined transactions if the transactions are described in paragraph (n)(1) of section.
(6)
Ordering rule for transactions entered into in connection with each other.
If a long party enters into more than two potential section 871(m) transactions that could be combined under this paragraph (n), a short party is required to apply paragraph (n)(1) of this section by combining transactions in a manner that results in the most transactions with a delta of 0.8 or higher with respect to the referenced underlying security. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer has sold one at-the-money put and purchased two at-the-money calls, each with respect to 100 shares of the same underlying security, the put and one call are combined. Similarly, a purchased call on 100 shares and a sold put on 200 shares of the same underlying security can be combined for 100 shares with 100 shares of the put remaining separate. The two calls are not combined because they do not provide the long party with economic exposure to depreciation in the underlying security. Similarly, if a long party enters into more than two potential section 871(m) transactions that could be combined under this paragraph (n), but have not been combined
by a short party, the long party is required to apply paragraph (n)(1) of this section by combining transactions in a manner that results in the most transactions with a delta of 0.8 or higher with respect to the referenced underlying security.
(7)
More than one underlying security referenced.
If potential section 871(m) transactions reference more than one underlying security, paragraph (n)(1) of this section applies separately with respect to each underlying security.
(o)
Anti-abuse rule.
If a taxpayer (directly or through the use of a related person within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)) acquires (whether by entering into, purchasing, accepting by transfer, by exchange, or by conversion, or otherwise acquiring) or disposes of (whether by sale, offset, exercise, termination, expiration, maturity, or other means) a transaction or transactions with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of this section, the Commissioner may treat any payment (as described in paragraph (i) of this section) made with respect to that transaction or transactions as a dividend equivalent to the extent necessary to prevent the avoidance of this section. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Commissioner may, for example, adjust the delta of a transaction, change the number of shares, adjust an estimated dividend amount, change the maturity, adjust the timing of payments, treat a transaction that references a partnership interest as referencing the assets of the partnership, combine, separate, or disregard transactions, indices, or components of indices to reflect the substance of the transaction or transactions, or otherwise depart from the rules of this section as necessary to determine whether the transaction includes a dividend equivalent or the amount or timing of a dividend equivalent. A purpose may be a principal purpose even though it is outweighed by other purposes (taken together or separately). When a withholding agent knows that the taxpayer acquired or disposed of a transaction or transactions with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of this section and the Commissioner treats a payment made with respect to any transaction as a dividend equivalent, the withholding agent may be liable for any tax pursuant to section 1461.
(p)
Information required to be reported regarding a potential section 871(m) transaction
— (1)
Responsible party
—(i)
In general.
If a broker or dealer is a party to a potential section 871(m) transaction with a counterparty or customer that is not a broker or dealer, the broker or dealer is required to determine whether the potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction. If both parties to a potential section 871(m) transaction are brokers or dealers, or neither party to a potential section 871(m) transaction is a broker or dealer, the short party must determine whether the potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction.
(ii)
Transactions with multiple brokers.
For a potential section 871(m) transaction in which both the short party and an agent or intermediary acting on behalf of the short party are a broker or dealer, the short party must determine whether the potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction. For a potential section 871(m) transaction in which the short party is not a broker or dealer and more than one agent or intermediary acting on behalf of the short party is a broker or dealer, the broker or dealer that is a party to the transaction and closest to the short party in the payment chain must determine whether the potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction. For a potential section 871(m) transaction in which neither the short party nor any agent or intermediary acting on behalf of the short party is a broker or dealer, and the long party and an agent or intermediary acting on behalf of the long party are a broker or dealer, or more than one agent or intermediary acting on behalf of the long party is a broker or dealer, the broker or dealer that is a party to the transaction and closest to the long party in the payment chain must determine whether the potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction.
(iii)
Responsible party for transactions traded on an exchange and cleared by a
clearing organization.
Except as provided in paragraph (p)(1)(iv) of this section, for a potential section 871(m) transaction that is traded on an exchange and cleared by a clearing organization, and for which more than one broker-dealer acts as an agent or intermediary between the short party and a foreign payee, the broker or dealer that has an ongoing customer relationship with the foreign payee with respect to that transaction (generally the clearing firm) must determine whether the potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction.
(iv)
Responsible party for certain structured notes, warrants, and convertible instruments.
When a potential section 871(m) transaction is a structured note, warrant, convertible stock, or convertible debt, the issuer is the party responsible for determining whether a potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction.
(v)
Obligations of the responsible party.
The party to the transaction that is required to determine whether a transaction is a section 871(m) transaction must also determine and report to the counterparty or customer the timing and amount of any dividend equivalent (as described in paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section). Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (n)(3) of this section, the party required to make the determinations described in this paragraph is required to exercise reasonable diligence to determine whether a transaction is a section 871(m) transaction, the amount of any dividend equivalents, and any other information necessary to apply the rules of this section. The information must be provided in the manner prescribed in paragraphs (p)(2) and (p)(3) of this section. The determinations required by paragraph (p) of this section are binding on the parties to the potential section 871(m) transaction and on any person who is a withholding agent with respect to the potential section 871(m) transaction unless the person knows or has reason to know that the information received is incorrect. The determinations are not binding on the Commissioner.
(2)
Reporting requirements.
For rules regarding the reporting requirements of withholding agents with respect to dividend equivalents described in this section, see §§ 1.1461-1(b) and (c) and 1.1474-1(c) and (d).
(3)
Additional information available to a party to a potential section 871(m) transaction
—(i)
In general.
Upon request by any person described in paragraph (p)(3)(ii) of this section, the party required to report information pursuant to paragraph (p)(1) of this section must provide the requester with information regarding the amount of each dividend equivalent, the delta of the potential section 871(m) transaction, the amount of any tax withheld and deposited, the estimated dividend amount if specified in accordance with paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section, the identity of any transactions combined pursuant to paragraph (n) of this section, and any other information necessary to apply the rules of this section. The information requested must be provided within a reasonable time, not to exceed 10 business days, and communicated in one or more of the following ways:
(A) By telephone, and confirmed in writing;
(B) By written statement sent by first class mail to the address provided by the requesting party;
(C) By electronic publication available to all persons entitled to request information; or
(D) By any other method agreed to by the parties, and confirmed in writing.
(ii)
Persons entitled to request information.
Any party to the transaction described in paragraph (a)(9) of this section may request the information specified in paragraph (p) of this section with respect to a potential section 871(m) transaction from the party required by paragraph (p)(3)(i) of this section to provide the information.
(iii)
Reliance on information received.
A person described in paragraph (p)(1) or (p)(3)(ii) of this section that receives information described in paragraph (p)(1) or (p)(3)(i) of this section may rely on that information to provide information to any other person unless the recipient knows or has reason to know that the information received is incorrect. When the recipient knows or has reason to know that the information received is incorrect, the recipient must make a reasonable effort to determine and provide the information
described in paragraph (p)(1) or (p)(3)(i) of this section to any person described in paragraph (p)(1) or (p)(3)(ii) of this section that requests information from the recipient.
(4)
Recordkeeping rules
—(i)
In general.
For rules regarding recordkeeping requirements sufficient to establish whether a transaction is a section 871(m) transaction and whether a payment is a dividend equivalent and the amount of gross income treated as a dividend equivalent, see § 1.6001-1.
(ii)
Records sufficient to establish whether a transaction is a section 871(m) transaction and any dividend equivalent amount.
Any person required to retain records must keep sufficient information to establish whether a transaction is a section 871(m) transaction and the amount of a dividend equivalent (if any), including documentation and work papers supporting the delta calculation or the substantial equivalence test (including the number of shares of the initial hedge), as applicable, and written estimated dividends (if any). The records and documentation must be created substantially contemporaneously. A record will be considered to have been created substantially contemporaneously if it was created within 10 business days of the date containing the calculation time for the potential section 871(m) transaction.
(iii)
Recordkeeping required for certain options.
With respect to any option to which paragraph (g)(4) of this section applies, contemporaneous documentation is not required to be retained provided that there is a pre-existing documented methodology that is sufficient to permit the delta for the transaction to be verified at a later time.
(5)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (p) of this section.
(i)
Example 1: Responsible party for a transaction with multiple broker-dealers.
(A)
Facts
. CO is a domestic clearing organization and is not a broker as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. CO serves as a central counterparty clearing and settlement service provider for derivatives exchanges in the United States. EB and CB are brokers organized in the United States and members of CO. FC, a foreign corporation, instructs EB to execute the purchase of a call option that is a specified ELI (as described in paragraph (e) of this section). EB effects the trade for FC on the exchange and then, as instructed by FC, transfers the option to CB to be cleared with CO. The exchange matches FC's order with an order for a written call option with the same terms and then sends the matched trade to CO, which clears the trade. CB and the clearing member representing the person who sold the call option settle the trade with CO. Upon receiving the matched trade, the option contracts are novated and CO becomes the counterparty to CB and the counterparty to the clearing member representing the person who sold the call option.
(B)
Analysis.
Both EB and CB are broker-dealers acting on behalf of FC for a potential section 871(m) transaction. Under paragraph (p)(1)(iii) of this section, however, only CB is required to make the determinations described in paragraph (p) of this section because CB has the ongoing customer relationship with FC with respect to the call option.
(ii) [Reserved]
(q)
Dividend and dividend equivalent payments to a qualified derivatives dealer
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (q), a qualified derivatives dealer described in § 1.1441-1(e)(6) that receives a payment (within the meaning of paragraph (i) of this section) of a dividend equivalent in its equity derivatives dealer capacity will not be liable for tax under section 881 on that dividend equivalent, provided that the qualified derivatives dealer complies with its obligations under the qualified intermediary withholding agreement described in §§ 1.1441-1(e)(5) and 1.1441-1(e)(6). A qualified derivatives dealer is liable for tax under section 881(a)(1) on its section 871(m) amount for each dividend on each underlying security. This tax liability is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of tax paid by the qualified derivatives dealer under section 881(a)(1) on dividends it receives with respect to that underlying security on that same dividend in its capacity as an equity derivatives dealer. In addition, a qualified derivatives dealer is liable for tax under section 881(a)(1) for
all dividend equivalents it receives that are not received in its equity derivatives dealer capacity. A qualified derivatives dealer also is liable for tax under section 881(a)(1) for all dividends it receives, other than dividends received in 2017 in its equity derivatives dealer capacity. This paragraph does not apply for a qualified derivatives dealer that is a foreign branch of a United States financial institution (within the meaning of § 1.1471-5(e)).
(2)
Transactions on the books of an equity derivatives dealer.
Transactions properly reflected in a qualified derivatives dealer's equity derivatives dealer book are presumed to be held by the dealer in its equity derivatives dealer capacity for purposes of determining the qualified derivatives dealer's tax liability. For purposes of determining whether a dealer is acting in its equity derivatives dealer capacity, only the dealer's activities as an equity derivatives dealer are taken into account. Accordingly, for purposes of this paragraph (q), a dividend or dividend equivalent is treated as received by a qualified derivatives dealer acting in its non-equity derivatives dealer capacity if the dividend or dividend equivalent is received by a qualified derivatives dealer acting as a proprietary trader.
(3)
Section 871(m) amount.
For each dividend on each underlying security, the section 871(m) amount is the product of:
(i) The qualified derivatives dealer's net delta exposure to the underlying security for the applicable dividend, multiplied by;
(ii) The applicable dividend amount per share.
(4)
Net delta exposure.
The net delta exposure to an underlying security is the amount (measured in number of shares) by which (A) the aggregate number of shares of an underlying security that the qualified derivatives dealer has exposure to as a result of positions in the underlying security (including as a result of owning the underlying security) with values that move in the same direction as the underlying security (the long positions) exceeds (B) the aggregate number of shares of an underlying security that the qualified derivatives dealer has exposure to as a result of positions in the underlying security with values that move in the opposite direction from the underlying security (the short positions). The net delta exposure calculation only includes long positions and short positions that the qualified derivatives dealer holds in its equity derivatives dealer capacity (as described in paragraph (q)(2) of this section). Any long positions or short positions that are treated as effectively connected with the qualified derivatives dealer's conduct of a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes are excluded from the net delta exposure computation. The net delta exposure to an underlying security is determined at the end of the day on the date provided in § 1.871-15(j)(2) for the applicable dividend. For purposes of this calculation, net delta must be determined in a commercially reasonable manner. If a qualified derivatives dealer calculates net delta for non-tax business purposes, the net delta ordinarily will be the delta used for that purpose, subject to the modifications required by this definition. Each qualified derivatives dealer must determine its net delta exposure separately only taking into account transactions that are recognized and are attributable to that qualified derivatives dealer for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (q):

# Example 1.
Forward contract entered into by a foreign equity derivatives dealer.
(i)
Facts.
FB is a foreign bank that is a qualified intermediary that acts as a qualified derivatives dealer. On April 1, Year 1, FB enters into a cash settled forward contract initiated by a foreign customer (Customer) that entitles Customer to receive from FB all of the appreciation and dividends on 100 shares of Stock X, and obligates Customer to pay FB any depreciation on 100 shares of Stock X, at the end of three years. FB hedges the forward contract by entering into a total return swap contract with a domestic broker (U.S. Broker) and maintains the swap contract as a hedge for the duration of the forward contract. The swap contract entitles FB to receive an amount equal to all of the dividends on 100 shares of Stock X and obligates FB to pay an amount referenced to a floating interest rate each quarter, and also entitles FB to receive from or pay to U.S. Broker, as the case may be, the difference between the
value of 100 shares of Stock X at the inception of the swap and the value of 100 shares of Stock X at the end of 3 years. Stock X pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. At the end of the day on the date provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section for the dividend, FB owns the forward contract and total return swap; FB does not own any shares of Stock X or any other transactions that reference Stock X. FB provides valid documentation to U.S. Broker that FB will receive payments under the swap contract in its capacity as a qualified derivatives dealer, and FB contemporaneously enters both the swap contract with U.S. Broker and the forward contract with Customer on its equity derivatives dealer books.
(ii)
Application of rules.
At the end of the day on the date provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section for the dividend, FB is a long party on a delta one contract (the total return swap) and a short party on a delta one contract (the forward contract with Customer). Pursuant to § 1.1441-1(b)(4)(xxii), U.S. Broker is not obligated to withhold on the dividend equivalent payments to FB on the swap contract that are referenced to Stock X dividends because U.S. Broker has received valid documentation that it may rely upon to treat the payment as made to FB acting as a qualified derivatives dealer. Pursuant to paragraph (q)(1) of this section, FB is not liable for tax under sections 871(m) and 881 on the payments it receives from U.S. Broker referenced to Stock X dividends because FB's net delta exposure with respect to 100 shares of Stock X is zero at the end of the day on the date provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section for the dividend. The net delta exposure is zero because the taxpayer has 100 shares of Stock X long position exposure as a result of the total return swap that is reduced by 100 shares of Stock X short position exposure as a result of the forward contract. FB is required to withhold on dividend equivalent payments to Customer on the forward contract in accordance with § 1.1441-2(e)(7).

# Example 2.
At-the-money option contract entered into by a foreign equity derivatives dealer.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as Example 1, but Customer purchases from FB an at-the-money call option on 100 shares of Stock X with a term of one year. The call option has a delta of 0.5, and FB hedges the call option by entering into a total return swap that references 50 shares of Stock X with U.S. Broker. At the end of the day on the date provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section for the dividend, the call option has a delta of 0.6, FB hedges the call option with a total return swap that references 60 shares of Stock X with U.S. Broker, and FB has no shares of Stock X or other transactions that reference Stock X.
(ii)
Application of rules.
At the end of the day on the date provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section for the dividend, FB is a long party on 60 shares of Stock X through the total return swap and a short party on an option. Because the option has a delta of less than 0.8 at the calculation time, it is not a section 871(m) transaction. Therefore, there will be no dividend equivalent payments made by FB to Customer that are subject to withholding. Pursuant to § 1.1441-1(b)(4)(xxii), U.S. Broker is not obligated to withhold on the dividend equivalents with respect to Stock X paid to FB because U.S. Broker has received valid documentation that it may rely upon to treat the dividend equivalents as paid to FB acting as a qualified derivatives dealer. The net delta exposure is zero at the end of the day on the date provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section for the dividend because FB has a long position of 60 shares as a result of the total return swap, which is reduced by FB's short position of 60 shares as a result of the option.

# Example 3.
In-the-money option contract entered into by a foreign equity derivatives dealer.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as Example 2, but Customer purchases from FB an in-the-money call option on 100 shares of Stock X with a term of one year. The call option has a delta of 0.8 and FB hedges the call option by purchasing 80 shares of Stock X, which are held in an account with U.S. Broker, who also acts as paying agent. The price of Stock X declines substantially and the option lapses unexercised. At the end of the day on the date provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section for the dividend, the call option has a delta of 0.48 and FB has reduced its hedge to 50 shares of Stock X with U.S. Broker. In addition, on that date, FB owns no other shares of Stock X or any other transactions that reference Stock X in its equity derivatives dealer capacity.
(ii)
Application of rules.
At the end of the day on the date provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section for the dividend, FB is a long party on 50 shares of Stock X and a short party on an option. Because the option has a delta of 0.8 at the calculation time, it is a section 871(m) transaction. Therefore, FB is required to withhold on dividend equivalent payments to Customer on the option contract in accordance with § 1.1441-2(e)(7). U.S. Broker is required to withhold on the Stock X dividends paid to FB. Assuming that FB is a qualified resident of a country with a treaty that provides withholding on dividends at a 15 percent rate, U.S. Broker is required withhold on the dividends with respect to the 50 shares of stock held by FB. FB's net delta exposure is two shares of Stock X at the end of the day on the date provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section because FB has a long position of 50 shares, reduced by FB's short position of 48 shares as a result of the option. FB's section 881 tax on the $0.50 (two shares multiplied by a dividend of $0.25 per share) is reduced (but not below zero) by
the section 881 tax amount paid by the qualified derivatives dealer on the 50 shares. Therefore, FB's section 871(m) amount is zero.

§ 1.872-2
Exclusions from gross income of nonresident alien individuals.
(a)
Earnings of foreign ships or aircraft
—(1)
Basic rule.
So much of the income from sources within the United States of a nonresident alien individual as consists of earnings derived from the operation of a ship or ships documented, or of aircraft registered, under the laws of a foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption to citizens of the United States nonresident in that foreign country and to corporations organized in the United States shall not be included in gross income.

Equivalent exemption
—(i)
Ships.

(ii)
Aircraft.
A foreign country which either imposes no income tax, or, in imposing an income tax, exempts from taxation so much of the income of a citizen of the U.S. nonresident in that foreign country and of a corporation organized in the United States as consists of earnings derived from the operation of aircraft registered under the laws of the United States is considered as granting an equivalent exemption for purposes of the exclusion from gross income of the earnings of foreign aircraft.
