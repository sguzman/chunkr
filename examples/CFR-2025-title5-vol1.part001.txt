§ 351.503
Length of service.
(a) All civilian service as a Federal employee, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105(a), is creditable for purposes of this part. Civilian service performed in employment that does not meet the definition of
Federal employee
set forth in 5 U.S.C. 2105(a) is creditable for purposes of this part only if specifically authorized by statute as creditable for retention purposes.
(b)(1) As authorized by 5 U.S.C. 3502(a)(A), all active duty in a uniformed service, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2101(3), is creditable for purposes of this part, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.

(3) An employee may not receive dual service credit for purposes of this part for service performed on active duty in the Armed Forces that was performed during concurrent civilian employment as a Federal employee, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105(a).
(c)(1) The agency is responsible for establishing both the service computation date, and the adjusted service computation date, applicable to each employee competing for retention under this part. If applicable, the agency is also responsible for adjusting the service computation date and the adjusted service computation date to withhold retention service credit for noncreditable service.
(2) The service computation date includes all actual creditable service under paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of this section.
(3) The adjusted service computation date includes all actual creditable service under paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of this section, and additional retention service credit for performance authorized by § 351.504 (d) and (e).

§ 351.504
Credit for performance.

# Note to § 351.504:
Compliance dates: Subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. Section 7116(a)(7), agencies may implement revised § 351.504 at any time between December 24, 1997 and October 1, 1998. For reduction in force actions effective between December 24, 1997 and September 30, 1998, agencies may use either § 351.504 effective December 24, 1997, or the prior § 351.504 in 5 CFR part 351 (January 1, 1997 edition).
(a)
Ratings used.
(1) Only ratings of record as defined in § 351.203 shall be used as the basis for granting additional retention service credit in a reduction in force.
(2) For employees who received ratings of record while covered by part 430, subpart B, of this chapter, those ratings of record shall be used to grant additional retention service credit in a reduction in force.
(3) For employees who received performance ratings while not covered by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43 and part 430, subpart B, of this chapter, those performance ratings shall be considered ratings of record for granting additional retention service credit in a reduction in force only when it is determined that those performance ratings are equivalent ratings of record under the provisions of § 430.201(c) of this chapter. The agency conducting the reduction in force shall make that determination.
(b)(1) An employee's entitlement to additional retention service credit for performance under this subpart shall be based on the employee's three most recent ratings of record received during the 4-year period prior to the date of issuance of reduction in force notices, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section.
(2) To provide adequate time to determine employee retention standing, an agency may provide for a cutoff date, a specified number of days prior to the issuance of reduction in force notices after which no new ratings of record will be put on record and used for purposes of this subpart. When a cutoff date is used, an employee will receive performance credit for the three most recent ratings of record received during the 4-year period prior to the cutoff date.
(3) To be creditable for purposes of this subpart, a rating of record must have been issued to the employee, with all appropriate reviews and signatures, and must also be on record (
i.e.,
the rating of record is available for use by the office responsible for establishing retention registers).
(4) The awarding of additional retention service credit based on performance for purposes of this subpart must be uniformly and consistently applied within a competitive area, and must be consistent with the agency's appropriate issuance(s) that implement these policies. Each agency must specify in its appropriate issuance(s):
(i) The conditions under which a rating of record is considered to have been received for purposes of determining whether it is within the 4-year period prior to either the date the agency issues reduction in force notices or the agency-established cutoff date for ratings of record, as appropriate; and
(ii) If the agency elects to use a cutoff date, the number of days prior to the issuance of reduction in force notices after which no new ratings of
record will be put on record and used for purposes of this subpart.
(c)
Missing ratings.
Additional retention service credit for employees who do not have three actual ratings of record during the 4-year period prior to the date of issuance of reduction in force notices or the 4-year period prior to the agency-established cutoff date for ratings of record permitted in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be determined under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, as appropriate, and as follows:
(1) An employee who has not received any rating of record during the 4-year period shall receive credit for performance based on the modal rating for the summary level pattern that applies to the employee's official position of record at the time of the reduction in force.
(2) An employee who has received at least one but fewer than three previous ratings of record during the 4-year period shall receive credit for performance on the basis of the value of the actual rating(s) of record divided by the number of actual ratings received. If an employee has received only two actual ratings of record during the period, the value of the ratings is added together and divided by two (and rounded in the case of a fraction to the next higher whole number) to determine the amount of additional retention service credit. If an employee has received only one actual rating of record during the period, its value is the amount of additional retention service credit provided.
(d)
Single rating pattern.
If all employees in a reduction in force competitive area have received ratings of record under a single pattern of summary levels as set forth in § 430.208(d) of this chapter, the additional retention service credit provided to employees shall be expressed in additional years of service and shall consist of the mathematical average (rounded in the case of a fraction to the next higher whole number) of the employee's applicable ratings of record, under paragraphs (b)(1) and (c) of this section computed on the following basis:
(1) Twenty additional years of service for each rating of record with a Level 5 (Outstanding or equivalent) summary;
(2) Sixteen additional years of service for each rating of record with a Level 4 summary; and
(3) Twelve additional years of service for each rating of record with a Level 3 (Fully Successful or equivalent) summary.
(e)
Multiple rating patterns.
If an agency has employees in a competitive area who have ratings of record under more than one pattern of summary levels, as set forth in § 430.208(d) of this chapter, it shall consider the mix of patterns and provide additional retention service credit for performance to employees expressed in additional years of service in accordance with the following:
(1) Additional years of service shall consist of the mathematical average (rounded in the case of a fraction to the next higher whole number) of the additional retention service credit that the agency established for the summary levels of the employee's applicable rating(s) of record.
(2) The agency shall establish the amount of additional retention service credit provided for summary levels only in full years; the agency shall not establish additional retention service credit for summary levels below Level 3 (Fully Successful or equivalent).
(3) When establishing additional retention service credit for the summary levels at Level 3 (Fully Successful or equivalent) and above, the agency shall establish at least 12 years, and no more than 20 years, additional retention service credit for a summary level.
(4) The agency may establish the same number of years additional retention service credit for more than one summary level.
(5) The agency shall establish the same number of years additional retention service credit for all ratings of record with the same summary level in the same pattern of summary levels as set forth in § 430.208(d) of this chapter.
(6) The agency may establish a different number of years additional retention service credit for the same summary level in different patterns.
(7) In implementing paragraph (e) of this section, the agency shall specify
the number(s) of years additional retention service credit that it will establish for summary levels. This information shall be made readily available for review.
(8) The agency may apply paragraph (e) of this section only to ratings of record put on record on or after October 1, 1997. The agency shall establish the additional retention service credit for ratings of record put on record prior to that date in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
[62 FR 62501, Nov. 24, 1997]
§ 351.505
Records.
(a) The agency is responsible for maintaining correct personnel records that are used to determine the retention standing of its employees competing for retention under this part.
(b) The agency must allow its retention registers and related records to be inspected by:
(1) An employee of the agency who has received a specific reduction in force notice, and/or the employee's representative if the representative is acting on behalf of the individual employee; and
(2) An authorized representative of OPM.
(c) An employee who has received a specific notice of reduction in force under authority of subpart H of this part has the right to review any completed records used by the agency in a reduction in force action that was taken, or will be taken, against the employee, including:
(1) The complete retention register with the released employee's name and other relevant retention information (including the names of all other employees listed on that register, their individual service computation dates calculated under § 351.503(d), and their adjusted service computation dates calculated under § 351.503(e)) so that the employee may consider how the agency constructed the competitive level, and how the agency determined the relative retention standing of the competing employees; and
(2) The complete retention registers for other positions that could affect the composition of the employee's competitive level, and/or the determination of the employee's assignment rights (e.g., registers to which the released employee may have potential assignment rights under § 351.701(b) and (c)).
(d) An employee who has not received a specific reduction in force notice has no right to review the agency's retention registers and related records.
(e) The agency is responsible for ensuring that each employee's access to retention records is consistent with both the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a).
(f) The agency must preserve all registers and records relating to a reduction in force for at least 1 year after the date it issues a specific reduction in force notice.
[64 FR 16800, Apr. 7, 1999]
§ 351.506
Effective date of retention standing.
Except for applying the performance factor as provided in § 351.504:
(a) The retention standing of each employee released from a competitive level in the order prescribed in § 351.601 is determined as of the date the employee is so released.
(b) The retention standing of each employee retained in a competitive level as an exception under § 351.606(b), § 351.607, or § 351.608, is determined as of the date the employee would have been released had the exception not been used. The retention standing of each employee retained under any of these provisions remains fixed until completion of the reduction in force action which resulted in the temporary retention.
(c) When an agency discovers an error in the determination of an employee's retention standing, it shall correct the error and adjust any erroneous reduction-in-force action to accord with the employee's proper retention standing as of the effective date established by this section.
[51 FR 319, Jan. 3, 1986, as amended at 60 FR 3063, Jan. 13, 1995; 62 FR 10682, Mar. 10, 1997]

# Subpart F—Release From Competitive Level
§ 351.601
Order of release from competitive level.
(a) Each agency must select competing employees for release from a competitive level (including release from a competitive level involving a pay band) under this part in the inverse order of retention standing, beginning with the employee with the lowest retention standing on the retention register. An agency may not release a competing employee from a competitive level while retaining in that level an employee with lower retention standing except:
(1) As required under § 351.606 when an employee is retained under a mandatory exception or under § 351.806 when an employee is entitled to a new written notice of reduction in force; or
(2) As permitted under § 351.607 when an employee is retained under a permissive continuing exception or under § 351.608 when an employee is retained under a permissive temporary exception.
(b) At its option an agency may provide for intervening displacement within the competitive level before final release of the employee with the lowest-retention standing from the competitive level.
(c) When employees in the same retention subgroup have identical service dates and are tied for release from a competitive level, the agency may select any tied employee for release.
[73 FR 29388, May 21, 2008]
§ 351.602
Prohibitions.
An agency may not release a competing employee from a competitive level while retaining in that level an employee with:
(a) A specifically limited temporary appointment;
(b) A specifically limited temporary or term promotion;
(c) A written decision under part 432 or 752 of this chapter of removal or demotion from the competitive level.

§ 351.603
Actions subsequent to release from competitive level.
An employee reached for release from a competitive level shall be offered assignment to another position in accordance with subpart G of this part. If the employee accepts, the employee shall be assigned to the position offered. If the employee has no assignment right or does not accept an offer under subpart G, the employee shall be furloughed or separated.
§ 351.604
Use of furlough.
(a) An agency may furlough a competing employee only when it intends within 1 year to recall the employee to duty in the position from which furloughed.
(b) An agency may not separate a competing employee under this part while an employee with lower retention standing in the same competitive level is on furlough.
(c) An agency may not furlough a competing employee for more than 1 year.
(d) When an agency recalls employees to duty in the competitive level from which furloughed, it shall recall them in the order of their retention standing, beginning with highest standing employee.
§ 351.605
Liquidation provisions.
When an agency will abolish all positions in a competitive area within 180 days, it must release employees in group and subgroup order consistent with § 351.601(a). At its discretion, the agency may release the employees in group order without regard to retention standing within a subgroup, except as provided in § 351.606. When an agency releases an employee under this section, the notice to the employee must cite this authority and give the date the liquidation will be completed. An agency may also apply §§ 351.607 and 351.608 in a liquidation.
[60 FR 2678, Jan. 11, 1995]
§ 351.606
Mandatory exceptions.
(a)
Armed Forces restoration rights.
When an agency applies § 351.601 or § 351.605, it shall give retention priorities over other employees in the same
subgroup to each group I or II employee entitled under 38 U.S.C. 2021 or 2024 to retention for, as applicable, 6 months or 1 year after restoration, as provided in part 353 of this chapter.
(b)
Use of annual leave to reach initial eligibility for retirement or continuance of health benefits.
(1) An agency shall make a temporary exception under this section to retain an employee who is being involuntarily separated under this part, and who elects to use annual leave to remain on the agency's rolls after the effective date the employee would otherwise have been separated by reduction in force, in order to establish initial eligibility for immediate retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336, 8412, or 8414, and/or to establish initial eligibility under 5 U.S.C. 8905 to continue health benefits coverage into retirement.
(2) An agency shall make a temporary exception under this section to retain an employee who is being involuntarily separated under authority of part 752 of this chapter because of the employee's decision to decline relocation (including transfer of function), and who elects to use annual leave to remain on the agency's rolls after the effective date the employee would otherwise have been separated by adverse action, in order to establish initial eligibility for immediate retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336, 8412, or 8414, and/or to establish initial eligibility under 5 U.S.C. 8905 to continue health benefits coverage into retirement.
(3) An employee retained under paragraph (b) by this section must be covered by chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code.
(4) An agency may not retain an employee under paragraph (b) of this section past the date that the employee first becomes eligible for immediate retirement, or for continuation of health benefits into retirement, except that an employee may be retained long enough to satisfy both retirement and health benefits requirements.
(5) Except as permitted by 5 CFR 351.608(d), an agency may not approve an employee's use of any other type of leave after the employee has been retained under a temporary exception authorized by paragraph (b) of this section.
(6) Annual leave for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section is described in § 630.212 of this chapter.
(c)
Documentation.
Each agency shall record on the retention register, for inspection by each employee, the reasons for any deviation from the order of release required by § 351.601 or § 351.605.
[62 FR 10682, Mar. 10, 1997]
§ 351.607
Permissive continuing exceptions.
An agency may make exception to the order of release in § 351.601 and to the action provisions of § 351.603 when needed to retain an employee on duties that cannot be taken over within 90 days and without undue interruption to the activity by an employee with higher retention standing. The agency shall notify in writing each higher-standing employee reached for release from the same competitive level of the reasons for the exception.
§ 351.608
Permissive temporary exceptions.
(a)
General.
(1) In accordance with this section, an agency may make a temporary exception to the order of release in § 351.601, and to the action provisions of § 351.603, when needed to retain an employee after the effective date of a reduction in force. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, an agency may not make a temporary exception for more than 90 days.
(2) After the effective date of a reduction in force action, an agency may not amend or cancel the reduction in force notice of an employee retained under a temporary exception so as to avoid completion of the reduction in force action. This does not preclude the employee from receiving or accepting a job offer in the same competitive area in accordance with a Reemployment Priority List established under part 330, subpart B, of this chapter, or under a Career Transition Assistance Plan established under part 330, subpart E, of this chapter, or equivalent programs.
(b)
Undue interruption.
An agency may make a temporary exception for not more than 90 days when needed to continue an activity without undue interruption.
(c)
Government obligation.
An agency may make a temporary exception to satisfy a Government obligation to the retained employee without regard to the 90-day limit set forth under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(d)
Sick leave.
An agency may make a temporary exception to retain on sick leave a lower standing employee covered by chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code (or other applicable leave system for Federal employees), who is on approved sick leave on the effective date of the reduction in force, for a period not to exceed the date the employee's sick leave is exhausted. Use of sick leave for this purpose must be in accordance with the requirements in part 630, subpart D, of this chapter (or other applicable leave system for Federal employees). Except as authorized by § 351.606(b), an agency may not approve an employee's use of any other type of leave after the employee has been retained under this paragraph (d).
(e)(1) An agency may make a temporary exception to retain on accrued annual leave a lower standing employee who:
(i) Is being involuntarily separated under this part;
(ii) Is covered by a Federal leave system under authority other than chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code; and,
(iii) Will attain first eligibility for an immediate retirement benefit under 5 U.S.C. 8336, 8412, or 8414 (or other authority), and/or establish eligibility under 5 U.S.C. 8905 (or other authority) to carry health benefits coverage into retirement during the period represented by the amount of the employee's accrued annual leave.
(2) An agency may not approve an employee's use of any other type of leave after the employee has been retained under this paragraph (e).
(3) This exception may not exceed the date the employee first becomes eligible for immediate retirement or for continuation of health benefits into retirement, except that an employee may be retained long enough to satisfy both retirement and health benefits requirements.
(4) Accrued annual leave includes all accumulated, accrued, and restored annual leave, as applicable, in addition to annual leave earned and available to the employee after the effective date of the reduction in force. When approving a temporary exception under this provision, an agency may not advance annual leave or consider any annual leave that might be credited to an employee's account after the effective date of the reduction in force other than annual leave earned while in an annual leave status.
(f)
Other exceptions.
An agency may make a temporary exception under this section to extend an employee's separation date beyond the effective date of the reduction in force when the temporary retention of a lower standing employee does not adversely affect the right of any higher standing employee who is released ahead of the lower standing employee. The agency may establish a maximum number of days, up to 90 days, for which an exception may be approved.
(g)
Notice to employees.
When an agency approves an exception for more than 30 days, it must:
(1) Notify in writing each higher standing employee in the same competitive level reached for release of the reasons for the exception and the date the lower standing employee's retention will end; and
(2) List opposite the employee's name on the retention register the reasons for the exception and the date the employee's retention will end.
[62 FR 10682, Mar. 10, 1997]

# Subpart G—Assignment Rights (Bump and Retreat)
§ 351.701
Assignment involving displacement.
(a)
General.
When a group I or II competitive service employee with a current annual performance rating of record of minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent, or higher, is released from a competitive level, an agency shall offer assignment, rather than furlough or separate, in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section to another competitive position which requires no reduction, or the
lease possible reduction, in representative rate. The employee must be qualified for the offered position. The offered position shall be in the same competitive area, last at least 3 months, and have the same type of work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time, intermittent, or seasonal) as the position from which the employee is released. Upon accepting an offer of assignment, or displacing another employee under this part, an employee retains the same status and tenure in the new position. The promotion potential of the offered position is not a consideration in determining an employee's right of assignment.
(b)
Lower subgroup—bumping.
A released employee shall be assigned in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and bump to a position that:
(1) Is held by another employee in a lower tenure group or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group; and
(2) Is no more than three grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent) below the position from which the employee was released.
(c)
Same subgroup-retreating.
A released employee shall be assigned in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section and retreat to a position that:
(1) Is held by another employee with lower retention standing in the same tenure group and subgroup; and
(2) Is not more than three grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent) below the position from which the employee was released, except that for a preference eligible employee with a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more the limit is five grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent). (The agency uses the grade progression of only the released employee's position of record to determine the applicable grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent) of the employee's retreat right. The agency does not consider the grade progression of the position to which the employee has a retreat right.); and
(3) Is the same position, or an essentially identical position, formerly held by the released employee on a permanent basis as a competing employee in a Federal agency (
i.e.,
when held by the released employee in an executive, legislative, or judicial branch agency, the position would have been placed in tenure groups I, II, or III, or equivalent). In determining whether a position is essentially identical, the determination is based on the competitive level criteria found in § 351.403, but not necessarily in regard to the respective grade, classification series, type of work schedule, or type of service, of the two positions.
(d)
Limitation.
An employee with a current annual performance rating of record of minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent may be assigned under paragraph (c) of this section only to a position held by another employee with a current annual performance rating of record no higher than minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent.
(e)
Pay rates.
(1) The determination of equivalent grade intervals shall be based on a comparison of representative rates.
(2) Each employee's assignment rights shall be determined on the basis of the pay rates in effect on the date of issuance of specific reduction-in-force notices, except that when it is officially known on the date of issuance of notices that new pay rates have been approved and will become effective by the effective date of the reduction in force, assignment rights shall be determined on the basis of the new pay rates.
(f)(1) In determining applicable grades (or grade intervals) under §§ 351.701(b)(2) and 351.701(c)(2), the agency uses the grade progression of the released employee's position of record to determine the grade (or interval) limits of the employee's assignment rights.
(2) For positions covered by the General Schedule, the agency must determine whether a one-grade, two-grade, or mixed grade interval progression is applicable to the position of the released employee.
(3) For positions not covered by the General Schedule, the agency must determine the normal line of progression for each occupational series and grade level to determine the grade (or interval) limits of the released employee's assignment rights. If the agency determines that there is no normal line of
progression for an occupational series and grade level, the agency provides the released employee with assignment rights to positions within three actual grades lower on a one-grade basis. The normal line of progression may include positions in different pay systems.
(4) For positions where no grade structure exists, the agency determines a line of progression for each occupation and pay rate, and provides assignment rights to positions within three grades (or intervals) lower on that basis.
(5) If the released employee holds a position that is less than three grades above the lowest grade in the applicable classification system (e.g., the employee holds a GS-2 position), the agency provides the released employee with assignment rights up to three actual grades lower on a one-grade basis in other pay systems.
(g) If a competitive area includes more than one local commuting area, the agency determines assignment rights under this part on the basis of the representative rates for one local commuting area within the competitive area (
i.e.
, the same local commuting area used to establish competitive levels under § 351.403(c)(4), (5), and (6)).
(h) If a competitive area includes positions under one or more pay bands, a released employee shall be assigned in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section to a position in an equivalent pay band or one pay band lower, as determined by the agency, than the pay band from which released. A preference eligible with a service-connected disability of 30 percent or more must be assigned in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section to a position in an equivalent pay band or up to two pay bands lower, as determined by the agency, than the pay band from which released.
(i) If a competitive area includes positions under one or more pay bands, and other positions not covered by a pay band (e.g., GS and/or FWS positions), the agency provides assignment rights under this part by:
(1) Determining the representative rate of positions not covered by a pay band, consistent with § 351.203;
(2) Determining the representative rate of each pay band, or competitive level within the pay band(s), consistent with § 351.203;
(3) As determined by the agency, providing assignment rights under paragraph (b) of this section (bumping), or paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section (retreating), consistent with the grade intervals covered in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of this section, and the pay band intervals in paragraph (h) of this section.

§ 351.702
Qualifications for assignment.
(a) Except as provided in § 351.703, an employee is qualified for assignment under § 351.701 if the employee:
(1) Meets the OPM standards and requirements for the position, including any minimum educational requirement, and any selective placement factors established by the agency;
(2) Is physically qualified, with reasonable accommodation where appropriate, to perform the duties of the position;
(3) Meets any special qualifying condition which the OPM has approved for the position; and
(4) Has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption. This determination includes recency of experience, when appropriate.
(b) The sex of an employee may not be considered in determining whether an employee is qualified for a position, except for positions which OPM has determined certification of eligibles by sex is justified.
(c) An employee who is released from a competitive level during a leave of absence because of a corpensable injury may not be denied an assignment right solely because the employee is not physically qualified for the duties of the position if the physical disqualification resulted from the compensable injury. Such an employee must be afforded appropriate assignment rights
subject to recovery as provided by 5 U.S.C. 8151 and part 353 of this chapter.
(d) If an agency determines, on the basis of evidence before it, that a preference eligible employee who has a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more is not able to fulfill the physical requirements of a position to which the employee would otherwise have been assigned under this part, the agency must notify the OPM of this determination. At the same time, the agency must notify the employee of the reasons for the determination and of the right to respond, within 15 days of the notification, to the OPM which will require the agency to demonstrate that the notification was timely sent to the employee's last known address. The OPM shall make a final determination concerning the physical ability of the employee to perform the duties of the position. This determination must be made before the agency may select any other person for the position. When the OPM has completed its review of the proposed disqualification on the basis of physical disability, it must sent its finding to both the agency and the employee. The agency must comply with the findings of the OPM. The functions of the OPM under this paragraph may not be delegated to an agency.
(e) An agency may formally designate as a trainee or developmental position a position in a program with all of the following characteristics:
(1) The program must have been designed to meet the agency's needs and requirements for the development of skilled personnel;
(2) The program must have been formally designated, with its provisions made known to employees and supervisors;
(3) The program must be developmental by design, offering planned growth in duties and responsibilities, and providing advancement in recognized lines of career progression; and
(4) The program must be fully implemented, with the participants chosen through standard selection procedures. To be considered qualified for assignment under § 351.701 to a formally designated trainee or developmental position in a program having all of the characteristics covered in paragraphs (e)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, an employee must meet all of the conditions required for selection and entry into the program.
[51 FR 319, Jan. 3, 1986, as amended at 60 FR 3063, Jan. 13, 1995]
§ 351.703
Exception to qualifications.
An agency may assign an employee to a vacant position under § 351.201(b) or § 351.701 of this part without regard to OPM's standards and requirements for the position if:
(a) The employee meets any minimum education requirement for the position; and
(b) The agency determines that the employee has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties and responsibilities of the position.
[56 FR 65417, Dec. 17, 1991]
§ 351.704
Rights and prohibitions.
(a)(1) An agency may satisfy an employee's right to assignment under § 351.701 by assignment to a vacant position under § 351.201(b), or by assignment under any applicable administrative assignment provisions of § 351.705, to a position having a representative rate equal to that the employee would be entitled under § 351.701. An agency may also offer an employee assignment under § 351.201(b) to a vacant position in lieu of separation by reduction in force under 5 CFR part 351. Any offer of assignment under § 351.201(b) to a vacant position must meet the requirements set forth under § 351.701.
(2) An agency may, at its discretion, choose to offer a vacant other-than-full-time position to a full-time employee or to offer a vacant full-time position to an other-than-full-time employee in lieu of separation by reduction in force.
(b) Section 351.701 does not:
(1) Authorize or permit an agency to assign an employee to a position having a higher representative rate;
(2) Authorize or permit an agency to displace a full-time employee by an other-than-full-time employee, or to satisfy an other-than-full-time employee's right to assignment by assigning the employee to a vacant full-time position.
(3) Authorize or permit an agency to displace an other-than-full-time employee by a full-time employee, or to satisfy a full-time employee's right to assignment by assigning the employee to a vacant other-than-full-time position.
(4) Authorize or permit an agency to assign a competing employee to a temporary position (
i.e.,
a position under an appointment not to exceed 1 year), except as an offer of assignment in lieu of separation by reduction in force under this part when the employee has no right to a position under § 351.701 or § 351.704(a)(1) of this part. This option does not preclude an agency from, as an alternative, also using a temporary position to reemploy a competing employee following separation by reduction in force under this part.
(5) Authorize or permit an agency to displace an employee or to satisfy a competing employee's right to assignment by assigning the employee to a position with a different type of work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time, intermittent, or seasonal) than the position from which the employee is released.

§ 351.705
Administrative assignment.
(a) An agency may, at its discretion, adopt provisions which:
(1) Permit a competing employee to displace an employee with lower retention standing in the same subgroup consistent with § 351.701 when the agency cannot make an equally reasonable assignment by displacing an employee in a lower subgroup;
(2) Permit an employee in subgroup III-AD to displace an employee in subgroup III-A or III-B, or permit an employee in subgroup III-A to displace an employee is subgroup III-B consistent with § 351.701; or
(3) Provide competing employees in the excepted service with assignment rights to other positions under the same appointing authority on the same basis as assignment rights provided to competitive service employees under § 351.701 and in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section.
(b) Provisions adopted by an agency under paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) Shall be consistent with this part;
(2) Shall be uniformly and consistently applied in any one reduction in force;
(3) May not provide for the assignment of an other-than-full-time employee to a full-time position;
(4) May not provide for the assignment of a full-time employee to an other-than-full-time position;
(5) May not provide for the assignment of an employee in a competitive service position to a position in the excepted service; and
(6) May not provide for the assignment of an employee in an excepted position to a position in the competitive service.

(a) An employee who receives a specific notice of separation under this part must be given information concerning the right to reemployment consideration and career transition assistance under subparts B (Reemployment Priority List), F, and G (Career Transition Assistance Programs) of part 330 of this chapter. The employee must also be given a release to authorize, at his or her option, the release of his or her resume and other relevant employment information for employment referral to the State unit or entity established under title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and potential public or private sector employers. The employee must also be given information concerning how to apply both for unemployment insurance through the appropriate State program and benefits available under the State's Workforce Investment Act of 1998 programs, and an estimate of severance pay (if eligible).
(b) When 50 or more employees in a competitive area receive separation notices under this part, the agency must provide written notification of the action, at the same time it issues specific notices of separation to employees, to:

(a) A notice expires when followed by the action specified, or by an action less severe than specified, in the notice

(b) An agency must give an employee an amended written notice if the reduction in force is changed to a later date.

(c) An agency must give an employee an amended written notice and allow the employee to decide whether to accept a better offer of assignment under subpart G of this part that becomes available before or on the effective date of the reduction in force. The agency must give the employee the amended notice regardless of whether the employee has accepted or rejected a previous offer of assignment, provided that the employee has not voluntarily separated from his or her official position.

§ 351.807
Certification of Expected Separation.
(a) For the purpose of enabling otherwise eligible employees to be considered for eligibility to participate in dislocated worker programs under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, an agency may issue a Certificate of Expected Separation to a competing employee who the agency believes, with a reasonable degree of certainty, will be separated from Federal employment by reduction in force procedures under this part. A certification may be issued up to 6 months prior to the effective date of the reduction in force.

et seq.
§ 352.201
Letter of Authority.
(a)
Definition.
A Letter of Authority is an authorization from OPM to an agency appointing officer to grant reemployment rights.
(b)
Scope of authority.
A Letter of Authority shall specify the conditions under which it may be used, including the types of positions covered and the organizational and geographic areas to which it is restricted.
(c)
Time limit of authority.
A Letter of Authority shall remain in force for one year from date of issuance unless earlier revoked by OPM. Renewals or extensions will not be issued unless justified by exceptional circumstances.
§ 352.202
Request for Letter of Authority.
When an agency believes that an emergency situation is so critical as to justify offers of reemployment rights, it may request OPM to issue a Letter of Authority. In submitting the request the agency shall present its justification in terms of the standards provided in § 352.203.
§ 352.203
Standards for issuing Letters of Authority.
OPM will determine the standards to be used in issuing Letters of Authority, which shall include the following:
(a) The positions to be filled must be related to emergency situations for which the usual recruiting methods are inadequate.
(b) The positions must be a part of a specific program immediately essential to the national interest.
(c) The positions must be essential to the functioning of the program.
(d) There must be substantial basis for the belief that reemployment rights will be a significant and reasonable aid in meeting the emergency situation.
§ 352.204
Basic eligibility for reemployment rights.
(a)
Employees eligible.
The following employees in the executive branch of the Government are eligible to be granted reemployment rights when they are hired by another executive agency without break in service of a full workday by transfer or reinstatement, or by excepted appointment, in a position which the agency is currently authorized to fill with reemployment rights:
(1) An employee serving in a competitive position under a career or career-conditional appointment;
(2) An employee serving under a career appointment in the Senior Executive Service (SES); or
(3) A nontemporary excepted employee.
(b)
Employees not eligible.
The following employees are not eligible to be granted reemployment rights:
(1) An employee who is serving a probationary or trial period under an appointment to a position in the excepted or competitive service or the SES.
(2) An employee serving in an obligated position;
(3) An employee serving with reemployment rights granted under this subpart;
(4) An employee who has received a notice of involuntary separation because of reduction in force or otherwise; or
(5) An employee who has already submitted a resignation.
[33 FR 12433, Sept. 4, 1968, as amended at 51 FR 25187, July 11, 1986]
§ 352.205
Appeal of losing agency.
An appointing officer who intends to employ with reemployment rights an employee of another executive agency shall give the losing agency written notice at least 15 calendar days before the effective date of the proposed action. If the losing agency believes the grant of reemployment rights would be detrimental to the public interest, it may appeal the proposed grant to OPM within 15 calendar days after receipt of the notice. The losing agency, at the same time, shall furnish a copy of the appeal to the prospective appointing officer, who shall withhold the proposed grant pending decision on the appeal. OPM shall determine whether the employee will be given reemployment rights and notify both agencies accordingly. If the losing agency does not appeal within 15 calendar days, the employee shall be granted reemployment rights.
§ 352.205a
Authority to return employee to his or her former or successor agency.
The transfer of an employee with a grant of reemployment rights under this subpart authorizes the return of the employee to his or her former or successor agency without regard to part 351, 752, or 771 of this chapter when the employee is reemployed in his or her former or successor agency—

§ 352.309
Retirement, health benefits, and group life insurance.
(a)
Agency action.
An employee who is transferred to an international organization with the consent of the employing agency is entitled to retain coverage for retirement, health benefits, and group life insurance purposes if he or she so chooses. The period during which coverage, rights, and benefits are retained under this paragraph, during employment with the international organization, is deemed employment by the United States. At the time an employing Federal agency consents to the transfer of an employee, the agency must advise the employee in writing of the employee's right to continue retirement, health benefits, and group life insurance coverage, as applicable, for the duration of the assignment or transfer. The notice must explain the conditions for continued coverage and the employee's obligations and responsibilities with regard to continued coverage. The notice must also explain that, if the employee elects to retain coverage, the agency will continue to make the agency contributions to the funds, and the employee's coverage will continue as long as employee payments are currently deposited in the respective funds.
(b)
Employee action.
The employee must acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the notice and state whether or not he or she wishes to retain coverage under the retirement, health benefits, and group life insurance systems or any of them by continuing the required employee payments. The employee must make a written election to retain benefits, as applicable, and make arrangements for the required employee payments. An employee who transfers to an international organization is not eligible to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) while employed by the international organization even if he or she elects to retain Federal retirement coverage. However, upon reemployment, an employee who elected to retain Federal retirement coverage while employed by the international organization and has made all deposits required for such coverage may make contributions to the TSP which he or she missed as a result of the service with an international organization, and receive make-up agency contributions and lost earnings on the agency contributions, as provided under § 352.311(e).
(c)
Agency responsibility.
For retirement and group life insurance purposes, the employing agency is responsible for determining the applicable rate of pay in accordance with the provisions of section 3583 of title 5, United States Code. The agency is also responsible for collecting, accounting for, and depositing in the respective funds all
retirement, health benefits, and group life insurance employee payments required to be made for the purpose of protecting the rights of the employee so transferred; and for accounting for and depositing in the respective funds all agency contributions. The agency must furnish the employee with specific information as to how, when, and where the payments are to be submitted.
(d)
Coverage.
Employee payments are considered to be currently deposited if received by the agency before, during, or within 3 months after the end of the pay period covered by the deposit. If the contributions are not currently deposited, coverage terminates on the last day of the pay period for which the required contributions were currently deposited, subject to a 31-day extension of group life insurance and health benefits coverage as provided in parts 870 and 890 of this chapter and to the conversion benefits provided in parts 870 and 890 of this chapter. Coverage so terminated may not be re-established before the employee actually enters on duty, on the first day in a pay status in an agency. However, terminated retirement, health benefits, and group life insurance coverage must be reinstated retroactively when, in the judgment of OPM, the failure to make the required current deposit was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control and the required payments were deposited at the first opportunity. Coverage under a system other than the Civil Service Retirement System must be reinstated retroactively if the agency which administers the retirement system determines that the failure to make the required current deposit was due to circumstances beyond the control of the employee and the required payments were deposited at the first opportunity.

§ 352.311
Reemployment.
(a) An employee who transferred to an international organization with the consent of the employing agency is entitled to be reemployed in his or her former position, or one of like seniority, status, and pay, within 30 days of applying for reemployment if the employee:
(1) Is separated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, without cause, within the term of employment with an international organization; and
(2) Applies for reemployment with the employing agency or its successor no later than 90 days after separation from the international organization.
(b) Pay upon reemployment will be set at that to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee remained with the employing agency.
(c) When an employee's reemployment right is to a position in the SES, reemployment may be to any position in the SES for which the employee is qualified. The employee must be returned at not less than the SES rate of basic pay as determined under 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, at which the employee was being paid immediately before transfer to the international organization, or if pay has been adjusted under § 352.314(c), at not less than the adjusted pay level.
(d) The period of separation caused by the employment of the employee with the international organization and the period necessary to effect reemployment are creditable service for all appropriate civil service employment purposes (e.g., tenure, service computation date, retirement, time in grade). Employees, upon return, are also entitled to restoration of any sick leave.
(e) An employee who elected to retain Federal retirement coverage while employed by the international organization and has made all deposits required for such coverage may make contributions to the TSP which he or she missed as a result of the service with the international organization, and receive make-up agency contributions and lost earnings on the agency contributions, consistent with applicable TSP requirements.
[73 FR 64861, Oct. 31, 2008]
§ 352.312
When to apply.
An employee may apply for reemployment, in writing, either before or after separation from the international organization. If the employee applies before separation, the 30-day period
prescribed in § 352.311 begins either with the date of the application or 30 days before the employee's date of separation from the international organization, whichever is later. If the employee applies for reemployment after separation, the application must be received by the employing agency no later than 90 days after separation from the international organization.
[73 FR 64861, Oct. 31, 2008]
§ 352.313
Failure to reemploy and right of appeal.
(a) When an agency fails to reemploy an employee within 30 days of receiving the employee's application, it must notify the employee, in writing, of the reasons and of the employee's right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations. The agency must comply with the provisions of § 1201.21 of this title.
(b) If the agency fails to reach and issue a decision to the employee within 30 days from the date of the application for reemployment, the employee is entitled to appeal the agency's failure to issue a decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations.
(c) An employee may submit an appeal, alleging that the agency has failed to comply with any of the other provisions of sections 3343 and 3581-3584 of title 5, United States Code, or of this part, to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations.
[73 FR 64861, Oct. 31, 2008]
§ 352.314
Consideration for promotion and pay increases.
(a) The employing agency must consider an employee who is detailed or transferred to an international organization for all promotions for which the employee would be considered if not absent. A promotion based on this consideration is effective on the date it would have been effective if the employee were not absent.
(b) When the position of an employee who is absent on detail or transfer to an international organization is upgraded during the employee's absence, the employing agency must place the employee in the upgraded position upon return.
(c) The employing agency must consider an employee who is detailed or transferred to an international organization from an ungraded pay system for all pay increases for which the employee would have been considered if not absent. An increase is effective on the date it would have been effective if the employee were not absent.

Partially recovered
means an injured employee, though not ready to resume the full range of his or her regular duties, has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements. Ordinarily, it is expected that a partially recovered employee will fully recover eventually.
Physically disqualified
means that:
(1)(i) For medical reasons the employee is unable to perform the duties of the position formerly held or an equivalent one, or
(ii) There is a medical reason to restrict the individual from some or all essential duties because of possible incapacitation (for example, a seizure) or because of risk of health impairment (such as further exposure to a toxic substance for an individual who has already shown the effects of such exposure).
(2) The condition is considered permanent with little likelihood for improvement or recovery.
Reasonable efforts
in the case of actions required by an agency for a person returning from uniformed service means actions, including training, that do not place an undue hardship on the agency.
Service in the uniformed services

(3) The overall size of the agency with respect to the number of employees, the number, type, and location of its facilities and type of operations, including composition, structure, and functions of the work force.
Uniformed services
means the Armed Forces, the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard when engaged in active duty for training, inactive duty training, or full-time National Guard duty, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service, and any other category of persons designated by the President in time of war or emergency.
§ 353.103
Persons covered.
(a) The provisions of this part pertaining to the uniformed services cover each agency employee who enters into such service regardless of whether the employee is located in the United States or overseas. However, an employee serving under a time-limited appointment completes any unexpired portion of his or her appointment upon return from uniformed service.
(b) The provisions of this part concerning employee injury cover a civil officer or employee in any branch of the Government of the United States, including an officer or employee of an instrumentally wholly owned by the United States, who was separated or furloughed from an appointment without time limitation, or from a temporary appointment pending establishment of a register (TAPER) as a result of a compensable injury; but do not include—

However, regardless of notification, an employee is still required to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights, and to seek reemployment within the time limits provided by chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, for restoration after uniformed
service, or as soon as he or she is able after a compensable injury.
§ 353.105
Maintenance of records.
Each agency shall identify the position vacated by an employee who is injured or leaves to enter uniformed service. It shall also maintain the necessary records to ensure that all such employees are preserved the rights and benefits granted by law and this part.
§ 353.106
Personnel actions during employee's absence.
(a) An employee absent because of service in the uniformed services is to be carried on leave without pay unless the employee elects to use other leave or freely and knowingly provides written notice of intent not to return to a position of employment with the agency, in which case the employee can be separated.

A separation under this provision affects only the employee's seniority while gone; it does not affect his or her restoration rights.)
(b) An employee absent because of compensable injury may be carried on leave without pay or separated unless the employee elects to use sick or annual leave.
(c) Agency promotion plans must provide a mechanism by which employees who are absent because of compensable injury or uniformed service can be considered for promotion. In addition, agencies have an obligation to consider employees absent on military duty for any incident or advantage of employment that they may have been entitled to had they not been absent. This is determined by:
(1) Considering whether the “incident or advantage” is one generally granted to all employees in that workplace and whether it was denied solely because of absence for military service;
(2) Considering whether the person absent on military duty was treated the same as if the person had remained at work; and
(3) Considering whether it was reasonably certain that the benefit would have accrued to the employee but for the absence for military service.
[60 FR 45652, Sept. 1, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 31487, June 11, 1999]
§ 353.107
Service credit upon reemployment.
Upon reemployment, an employee absent because of uniformed service or compensable injury is generally entitled to be treated as though he or she had never left. This means that a person who is reemployed following uniformed service or full recovery from compensable injury receives credit for the entire period of the absence for purposes of rights and benefits based upon seniority and length of service, including within-grade increases, career tenure, completion of probation, leave rate accrual, and severance pay.
§ 353.108
Effect of performance and conduct on restoration rights.
The laws covered by this part do not permit an agency to circumvent the protections afforded by other laws to employees who face the involuntary loss of their positions. Thus, an employee may not be denied restoration rights because of poor performance or conduct that occurred prior to the employee's departure for compensable injury or uniformed service. However, separation for cause that is substantially unrelated to the injury or to the performance of uniformed service negates restoration rights. Additionally, if during the period of injury or uniformed service the employee's conduct is such that it would disqualify him or her for employment under OPM or agency regulations, restoration rights may be denied.
§ 353.109
Transfer of function to another agency.
If the function of an employee absent because of uniformed service or compensable injury is transferred to another agency, and if the employee would have been transferred with the function under part 351 of this chapter had he or she not been absent, the employee is entitled to be placed in a position in the gaining agency that is equivalent to the one he or she left. It shall also assume the obligation to restore the employee in accordance with law and this part.
§ 353.110
OPM placement assistance.
(a)
Employee returning from uniformed service.
(1) OPM will offer placement in
the executive branch to the following categories of employees upon notification by the agency and application by the employee: (Such notification should be sent to the Associate Director for Employment, OPM, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415.)
(i) Executive branch employees (other than an employee of an intelligence agency) when
OPM determines
that:
(A) their agencies no longer exist and the functions have not been transferred, or;
(B) it is otherwise impossible or unreasonable for their former agencies to place them;
(ii) Legislative and judicial branch employees when
their employers
determine that it is impossible or unreasonable to reemploy them;
(iii) National Guard technicians when the Adjutant General of a State determines that it is impossible or unreasonable to reemploy a technician otherwise eligible for restoration under 38 U.S.C. 4304 and 4312 (pertaining to character and length of service), and the technician is a noncareer military member who was separated invountarily from the Guard for reasons beyond his or her control; and
(iv) Employees of the intelligence agencies (defined in 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii)) when
their agencies
determine that it is impossible or unreasonable to reemploy them.
(2) OPM will determine if a vacant position equivalent (in terms of pay, grade, and status) to the one the individual left exists, for which the individual is qualified, in the commuting area in which he or she was employed immediately before entering the uniformed services. If such a vacancy exists, OPM will order the agency to place the individual. If no such position is available, the individual may elect to be placed in a lesser position in the commuting area, or OPM will attempt to place the individual in an equivalent position in another geographic location determined by OPM. If the individual declines an offer of equivalent employment, he or she has no further restoration rights.
(b) Employee returning from compensable injury. OPM will provide placement assistance to an employee with restoration rights in the executive, legislative, or judicial branches who cannot be placed in his or her former agency and who either has competitive status or is eligible to acquire it under 5 U.S.C. 3304(C). If the employee's agency is abolished and its functions are not transferred, or it is not possible for the employee to be restored in his or her former agency, the employee is eligible for placement assistance under the Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan (ICTAP) under part 330, subpart G, of this chapter. This paragraph does not apply to an employee serving under a temporary appointment pending establishment of a register (TAPER).
[60 FR 45652, Sept. 1, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 31487, June 11, 1999; 66 FR 29897, June 4, 2001]

# Subpart B—Uniformed Service
§ 353.201
Introduction.
The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 revised and strengthened the existing Veterans' Reemployment Rights law, made the Department of Labor responsible for investigating employee complaints, required OPM to place certain returning employees in other agencies, established a separate restoration rights program for employees of the intelligence agencies, and altered the appeals rights process. The new law applies to persons exercising restoration rights on or after December 12, 1994.
§ 353.202
Discrimination and acts of reprisal prohibited.
A person who seeks or holds a position in the Executive branch may not be denied hiring, retention in employment, or any other incident or advantage of employment because of any application, membership, or service in the uniformed services. Furthermore, an agency may not take any reprisal against an employee for taking any action to enforce a protection, assist or participate in an investigation, or exercise any right provided for under chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code.
§ 353.203
Length of service.
(a)
Counting service after the effective date of USERRA (12/12/94).
To be entitled to restoration rights under this part, cumulative service in the uniformed services while employed by the Federal Government may not exceed 5 years. However, the 5-year period does not include any service—
(1) That is required beyond 5 years to complete an initial period of obligated service;
(2) During which the individual was unable to obtain orders releasing him or her from service in the uniformed services before expiration of the 5-year period, and such inability was through no fault of the individual;
(3) Performed as required pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 10147, under 32 U.S.C. 502(a) or 503, or to fulfill additional training requirements determined and certified in writing by the Secretary of the military department concerned to be necessary for professional development or for completion of skill training or retraining;
(4) Performed by a member of a uniformed service who is:
(i) Ordered to or retained on active duty under sections 12301(a), 12301(g), 12302, 12304, 12305, or 688 of title 10, United States Code, or under 14 U.S.C. 331, 332, 359, 360, 367, or 712;
(ii) Ordered to or retained on active duty (other than for training) under any provision of law during a war or during a national emergency declared by the President or the Congress, as determined by the Secretary concerned.
(iii) Ordered to active duty (other than for training) in support, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned, of an operational mission for which personnel have been ordered to active duty under 10 U.S.C. 12304;
(iv) Ordered to active duty in support, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned, of a critical mission or requirement of the uniformed services, or
(v) Called into Federal service as a member of the National Guard under chapter 15 or under section 12406 of title 10, United States Code.
(b)
Counting service prior to the effective date of USERRA.
In determining the 5-year total that may not be exceeded for purposes of exercising restoration rights, service performed prior to December 12, 1994, is considered only to the extent that it would have counted under the previous law (the Veterans' Reemployment Rights statute). For example, the service of a National Guard technician who entered on an Active Guard Reserve (AGR) tour under section 502(f) of title 32, United States Code, was not counted toward the 4-year time limit under the previous statute because it was specifically considered active duty for training. However, title 32, section 502(f) AGR service is not exempt from the cumulative time limits allowed under USERRA and service after the effective date counts under USERRA rules. Thus, if a technician was on a 32 U.S.C. 502(f) AGR tour on October 13, 1994, (the date USERRA was signed into law), but exercised restoration rights after December 11, 1994, (the date USERRA became fully effective), AGR service prior to December 12 would not count in computing the 5-year total, but all service beginning with that date would count.
(c)
Nature of Reserve service and resolving conflicts.
An employee who is a member of the Reserve or National Guard has a dual obligation—to the military and to his or her employer. Given the nature of the employee's service obligation, some conflict with job demands is often unavoidable and a good-faith effort on the part of both the employee and the agency is needed to minimize conflict and resolve differences. Some accommodation may be necessary by both parties. Most Reserve component members are required, as a minimum, to participate in drills for 2 days each month and in 2 weeks of active duty for training per year. But some members are required to participate in longer or more frequent training tours. USERRA makes it clear that the timing, frequency, duration, and nature of the duty performed is not an issue so long as the employee gave proper notice, and did not exceed the time limits specified. However, to the extent that the employee has influence upon the timing, frequency, or duration of such training or duty, he or she is expected to use that influence to minimize the burden
upon the agency. The employee is expected to provide the agency with as much advance notice as possible whenever military duty or training will interfere with civilian work. When a conflict arises between the Reserve duty and the legitimate needs of the employer, the agency may contact appropriate military authorities to express concern. Where the request would require the employee to be absent from work for an extended period, during times of acute need, or when, in light of previous leaves, the requested leave is cumulatively burdensome, the agency may contact the military commander of the employee's military unit to determine if the military duty could be rescheduled or performed by another member. If the military authorities determine that the military duty cannot be rescheduled or cancelled, the agency is required to permit the employee to perform his or her military duty.
(d)
Mobilization authority.
By law, members of the Selected Reserve (a component of the Ready Reserve), can be called up under a presidential order for purposes other than training for as long as 270 days. If the President declares a national emergency, the remainder of the Ready Reserve—the Individual Ready Reserve and the Inactive National Guard—may be called up. The Ready Reserve as a whole is subject to as much as 24 consecutive months of active duty in a national emergency declared by the President.
[60 FR 45652, Sept. 1, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 31487, June 11, 1999]
§ 353.204
Notice to employer.
To be entitled to restoration rights under this part, an employee (or an appropriate officer of the uniformed service in which service is to be performed) must give the employer advance written or verbal notice of the service except that no notice is required if it is precluded by military necessity or, under all relevant circumstances, the giving of notice is otherwise impossible or unreasonable.
§ 353.205
Return to duty and application for reemployment.
Periods allowed for return to duty are based on the length of time the person was performing service in the uniformed services, as follows:
(a) An employee whose uniformed service was for
less than 31 days,
or who was absent for the purpose of an examination to determine fitness for the uniformed services, is required to report back to work not later than the beginning of the first regularly scheduled work day on the first full calendar day following completion of the period of service and the expiration of 8 hours after a period allowing for the safe transportation of the employee from the place of service to the employee's residence, or as soon as possible after the expiration of the 8-hour period if reporting within the above period is impossible or unreasonable through no fault of the employee.
(b) If the service was for
more than 30 but less than 181 days,
the employee must submit an application for reemployment with the agency not later than 14 days after completing the period of service. (If submitting the application is impossible or unreasonable through no fault of the individual, it must be submitted the next full calendar day when it becomes possible to do so.)
(c) If the period of service was for
more than 180 days,
the employee must submit an application for reemployment not later than 90 days after completing the period of service.
(d) An employee who is hospitalized or convalescing from an injury or illness incurred in, or aggravated during uniformed service is required to report for duty at the end of the period that is necessary for the person to recover, based on the length of service as discussed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, except that the period of recovery may not exceed 2 years (extended by the minimum time required to accommodate circumstances beyond the employee's control which make reporting within the period specified impossible or unreasonable).
(e) A person who does not report within the time limits specified does not automatically forfeit restoration rights, but, rather, is subject to whatever policy and disciplinary action the agency would normally apply for a similar absence without authorization.
§ 353.206
Documentation upon return.
Upon request, a returning employee who was absent for more than 30 days, or was hospitalized or convalescing from an injury or illness incurred in or aggravated during the performance of service in the uniformed services, must provide the agency with documentation that establishes the timeliness of the application for reemployment, and length and character of service. If documentation is unavailable, the agency must restore the employee until documentation becomes available.
§ 353.207
Position to which restored.
(a)
Timing.
An employee returning from the uniformed services following an absence of more than 30 days is entitled to be restored as soon as possible after making application, but in no event later than 30 days after receipt of the application by the agency.
(b)
Nondisabled.
If the employee's uniformed service was for less than 91 days, he or she must be employed in the position for which qualified that he or she would have attained if continuously employed. If not qualified for this position after reasonable efforts by the agency to qualify the employee, he or she is entitled to be placed in the position he or she left. For service of 91 days or more, the agency has the option of placing the employee in a position of like seniority, status, and pay. (
Note:
Upon reemployment, a term employee completes the unexpired portion of his or her original appointment.) If unqualified (for any reason other than disability incurred in or aggravated during service in the uniformed services) after reasonable efforts by the agency to qualify the employee for such position or the position the employee left, he or she must be restored to any other position of lesser status and pay for which qualified, with full seniority.
(c)
Disabled.
An employee with a disability incurred in or aggravated during uniformed service and who, after reasonable efforts by the agency to accommodate the disability, is entitled to be placed in another position for which qualified that will provide the employee with the same seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation consistent with the circumstances in each case. The agency is not required to reemploy a disabled employee if, after making due efforts to accommodate the disability, such reemployment would impose an undue hardship on the agency.
(d)
Two or more persons entitled to restoration in the same position.
If two or more persons are entitled to restoration in the same position, the one who left the position first has the prior right to restoration in that position. The other employee(s) is entitled to be placed in a position as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(e)
Relationship to an entitlement based on veterans' preference.
An employee's right to restoration under this part does not entitle the person to retention, preference, or displacement rights over any person with a superior claim based on veterans' preference.
§ 353.208
Use of paid time off during uniformed service.
An employee performing service with the uniformed services must be permitted, upon request, to use any accrued annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304, military leave under 5 U.S.C. 6323, earned compensatory time off for travel under 5 U.S.C. 5550b, or sick leave under 5 U.S.C. 6307, if appropriate, during such service.
[72 FR 62767, Nov. 7, 2007]
§ 353.209
Retention protections.
(a)
During uniformed service.
An employee may not be demoted or separated (other than military separation) while performing duty with the uniformed services except for cause. (Reduction in force is not considered “for cause” under this subpart.) He or she is not a “competing employee” under § 351.404 of this chapter. If the employee's position is abolished during such absence, the agency must reassign the employee to another position of like status, and pay.
(b)
Upon reemployment.
Except in the case of an employee under time-limited appointment who finishes out the unexpired portion of his or her appointment upon reemployment, an employee reemployed under this subpart may not be discharged, except for cause—
(1) If the period of uniformed service was more than 180 days, within 1 year; and
(2) If the period of uniformed service was more than 30 days, but less than 181 days, within 6 months.
§ 353.210
Department of Labor assistance to applicants and employees.
USERRA requires the Department of Labor's Veterans' Employment and Training Service [VETS] to provide employment and reemployment assistance to any Federal employee or applicant who requests it. VETS staff will attempt to resolve employment disputes brought to investigate. If dispute resolution proves unsuccessful, VETS will, at the request of the employee, refer the matter to the Office of the Special Counsel for representation before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).
[64 FR 31487, June 11, 1999]
§ 353.211
Appeal rights.
An individual who believes an agency has not complied with the provisions of law and this part relating to the employment or reemployment of the person by the agency may—
(a) File a complaint with the Department of Labor, as noted in § 353.210, or
(b) Appeal directly to MSPB if the individual chooses not to file a complaint with the Department of Labor, or is informed by either Labor or the Office of the Special Counsel that they will not pursue to the case. However, National Guard technicians do not have the right to appeal to MSPB a denial of reemployment rights by the Adjutant General. Technicians may file complaints with the appropriate district court in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 4323 (USERRA).
[60 FR 45652, Sept. 1, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 31487, June 11, 1999]

# Subpart C—Compensable Injury
§ 353.301
Restoration rights.
(a)
Fully recovered within 1 year.
An employee who fully recovers from a compensable injury within 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to be restored immediately and unconditionally to his or her former position or an equivalent one. Although these restoration rights are agencywide, the employee's basic entitlement is to the former position or equivalent in the local commuting area the employee left. If a suitable vacancy does not exist, the employee is entitled to displace an employee occupying a continuing position under temporary appointment or tenure group III. If there is no such position in the local commuting area, the agency must offer the employee a position (as described above) in another location. This paragraph also applies when an injured employee accepts a lower-grade position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers. A fully recovered employee is expected to return to work immediately upon the cessation of compensation.
(b)
Fully recovered after 1 year.
An employee who separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency's reemployment priority list for the competitive service or reemployment list for the excepted service. If the individual cannot be placed in the former commuting area, he or she is entitled to priority consideration for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency. (See parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for more information on how this may be accomplished for the excepted and competitive services, respectively.) This subpart also applies when an injured employee accepts a lower-graded position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers.
(c)
Physically disqualified.
An individual who is physically disqualified for the former position or equivalent because of a compensable injury, is entitled to be placed in another position for which qualified that will provide the employee with the same status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof, consistent with the circumstances in each case. This right is agencywide and applies for a period of 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation begins. After 1 year, the individual is entitled to the rights accorded individuals who fully or partially recover, as applicable.
(d)
Partially recovered.
Agencies must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. At a minimum, this would mean treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. (See 29 U.S.C. 791(b) and 794.) If the individual fully recovers, he or she is entitled to be considered for the position held at the time of injury, or an equivalent one. A partially recovered employee is expected to seek reemployment as soon as he or she is able.
§ 353.302
Retention protections.
An injured employee enjoys no special protection in a reduction in force. Separation by reduction in force or for cause while on compensation means the individual has no restoration rights.
§ 353.303
Restoration rights of TAPER employees.
An employee serving in the competitive service under a temporary appointment pending establishment of a register (TAPER) under § 316.201 of this chapter (other than an employee serving in a position classified above GS-15), is entitled to be restored to the position he or she left or an equivalent one in the same commuting area.
§ 353.304
Appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an injured employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch (including the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission) may appeal to the MSPB an agency's failure to restore, improper restoration, or failure to return an employee following a leave of absence. All appeals must be submitted in accordance with MSPB's regulations.
(b) An individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year after compensation begins may appeal to MSPB as provided for in parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for excepted and competitive service employees, respectively.
(c) An individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury may appeal to MSPB for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration. Upon reemployment, a partially recovered employee may also appeal the agency's failure to credit time spent on compensation for purposes of rights and benefits based upon length of service.

§ 359.603
OPM priority placement.
(a)
Agency certification.
(1) If there is no vacant SES position within the agency for which an appointee covered by § 359.602(b) is qualified, the agency head, or the acting agency head in the absence of the agency head, shall certify to OPM in writing that no such position is available. This certification may not be delegated below the Assistant Secretary level in a department, or an equivalent level above the director of personnel in other agencies.

head. The response may not be delegated below the Assistant Secretary level in a department, or an equivalent level above the director of personnel in other agencies.
(3) If an agency cancels a position while a referral to the position is pending, the appointee will be entitled to priority consideration for the position if it or a successor position is reestablished in the SES within 1 year of the cancellation date and the appointee has not been placed in another SES position.

Corrective action.
If an agency fails to provide bona fide priority consideration, OPM may order appropriate corrective action.
(f)
Declination by employee.
If a career appointee declines a reasonable offer of placement, OPM's placement efforts will cease. The appointee may be removed from the SES at the expiration of the agency notice period.

(1) The basis for the removal,
i.e.,
5 U.S.C. 3595(b)(5) if the basis is expiration of the 45-day OPM placement period, or 5 U.S.C. 3595(b)(4) if the basis is declination of a reasonable offer of placement, in which case identify the position offered and the date on which it was declined;

§ 359.702
Placement rights.
(a) An appointee covered by this subpart is entitled to be placed in a vacant civil service position (other than an SES position) in any agency that is—

(2) A position for which the appointee meets the qualifications requirements.
(b) A probationary appointee, or a nonprobationary appointee who at the time of appointment to the SES held a career or career-conditional appointment (or an appointment of equivalent tenure, as defined in § 359.701(a)), is entitled to be placed in a position of tenure equivalent to that of the appointment held at the time of appointment to the SES. This tenure requirement does not apply—
(1) If the agency taking the removal action does not have a position of equivalent tenure for which the appointee meets the qualifications requirements; or
(2) If the appointee is willing to accept a position having a different tenure.
§ 359.703
Responsibility for placement.
The agency taking the removal action is responsible for placing the appointee in an appropriate position within the agency, or for arranging a transfer to an appropriate position in another agency. Any transfer must be mutually acceptable to the appointee and the gaining agency.
§ 359.704
Restrictions.
Placement of an appointee under this subpart shall not cause the separation or reduction in grade of any other employee.
§ 359.705
Pay.
(a) An appointee placed under this subpart in a position outside the SES (in the same or different agency) is entitled to receive basic pay at the highest of—
(1) The rate of basic pay in effect for the position in which the appointee is being placed (
i.e.
, a rate of basic pay within the normal rate range of the position in which placed, consistent with
the rules of the pay system covering such position);
(2) The rate of basic pay currently in effect for the position the appointee held immediately before being appointed to the SES; or
(3) The rate of basic pay in effect for the appointee immediately before removal from the SES.
(b)(1) The rate of basic pay under paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this section includes any applicable locality payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304, special rate supplement under 5 U.S.C. 5305, or similar payment under other legal authority.
(2) When an employee is entitled to a payable rate of basic pay under paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section which exceeds the maximum payable rate of basic pay for the grade or level of the employee's position after placement, the resulting saved rate is subject to the adjustment and termination rules in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section.
(c)(1) For an employee placed in a General Schedule position, a saved rate established under this section may not be supplemented by a locality payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304, a special rate supplement under 5 U.S.C. 5305, or a similar payment under other legal authority.
(2) A saved rate established under this section is subject to the limitation on Senior Executive Service pay in 5 U.S.C. 5382 of the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule.
(3) A saved rate established under this section is considered an employee's rate of basic pay for the same purposes as a retained rate under 5 CFR part 536, as described in 5 CFR 536.307.
(d) A saved rate established under this section must be adjusted in connection with a pay schedule adjustment according to the following rules:
(1) When the maximum payable rate of basic pay for the grade or level of an employee's position is increased while the employee is receiving a saved rate, the employee is entitled to a pay adjustment equal to 50 percent of the amount of the increase in that maximum payable rate, except as otherwise provided in this section.
(2) If an employee's official worksite is changed while the employee is receiving a saved rate, a change in the applicable range maximum because of a change in an employee's official worksite is not considered in applying paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Instead, any adjustment of the employee's saved rate in conjunction with a change in official worksite must be determined under paragraph (e) of this section. If an employee's range maximum is increased because of a pay schedule adjustment on the same effective date as a change in the employee's official worksite, the saved rate must be adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section before applying paragraph (e) of this section.
(3) A change in an employee's rate range maximum resulting from a change in the employee's position (e.g., change in occupational series) that causes the employee to be covered by a different pay schedule does not result in application of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(4) When an employee's saved rate becomes equal to or lower than the maximum payable rate of basic pay for the grade or level of the employee's position, the employee is entitled to the maximum payable rate, and saved pay under this section ceases to apply.
(e) When an employee receiving a saved rate established under this section is covered by a pay system that provides different basic pay schedules based on geographic location (such as the General Schedule pay system), the saved rate must be adjusted in conjunction with a change in the employee's official worksite consistent with the geographic conversion rule for retained rates under 5 CFR 536.303(b).
(f) A saved rate established under this section must be terminated if—
(1) The employee has a break in service of 1 workday or more;
(2) The employee is demoted based on unacceptable performance or conduct or at the employee's request; or
(3) The employee becomes entitled to a rate of basic pay that is equal to or higher than the saved rate.
(g) If an employee is receiving a saved rate established under this section on May 1, 2005 (when section 301 of
Pub. L. 108-411 took effect), any locality payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304 formerly paid in addition to the employee's saved rate no longer applies as of that date. Any locality-adjusted saved rate in effect and payable on April 30, 2005, must be converted to an equal saved rate effective on May 1, 2005. If the employee received no locality payment because of a pay limitation, no conversion under this paragraph is required.

§ 362.103
Authority.
An agency may make an appointment under this part to a position defined in § 213.3402 of this chapter, provided a Memorandum of Understanding between the head of the agency or his or her designee and OPM is in effect.
§ 362.104
Agency requirements.
(a)
Agency policy.
To make any appointment under a Pathways authority, an agency must first establish a Pathways Policy. The Pathways Policy must:

(2) State the delegations of authority for the agency's use of the Pathways Programs (e.g., department-wide vs. bureaus or components).
(3) Include any implementing policy or guidance that the agency determines would facilitate successful implementation and administration for each Pathways Program.
(4) Prescribe criteria and procedures for agency-approved extensions for Recent Graduates and PMFs, not to exceed 120 days. Extension criteria must be limited to circumstances that would render the agency's compliance with the regulations impracticable or impossible.
(5) Describe how the agency will design, implement, and document formal training and/or development, as well as the type and duration of assignments.
(6) Include a commitment from the agency to:
(i) Provide to OPM any information it requests on the agency's Pathways Programs;

(iv) Provide a meaningful on-boarding process for each Pathways Program; and
(v) Provide OPM with the names of the agency's Pathways Programs Officer and PMF Coordinator.
(7) Identify the agency's Pathways Programs Officer (PPO), who:
(i) Must be in a position at the agency's headquarters level, or at the headquarters level of a departmental component, in a position at or higher than grade 12 of the General Schedule (GS) (or the equivalent under the Federal Wage System (FWS) or another pay and classification system);
(ii) Is responsible for administering the agency's Pathways Programs, including coordinating the recruitment and on-boarding process for Pathways Programs Participants, and coordinating the agency's Pathways Programs plan with agency stakeholders and other hiring plans (e.g., merit promotion plans, agency plans pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14035, “Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce”);
(iii) Serves as a liaison with OPM by providing updates on the agency's implementation of its Pathways Programs, clarifying technical or programmatic issues, sharing agency best practices, and other similar duties; and
(iv) Reports to OPM on the agency's implementation of its Pathways Programs and individuals hired under these Programs, in conjunction with the agency's Pathways Policy.
(8) Identify the agency's PMF Coordinator who:
(i) Must be in a position at the agency's headquarters level, or at the headquarters level of departmental component, or sub-agency level, in a position
at or higher than grade 12 of the GS (or the equivalent under the FWS or another pay and classification system). If an agency or sub agency designates multiple PMF Coordinators, they must work collaboratively to administer the agency's PMF Program.

These procedures must specify the timeline for making the determination, which must include informing the Pathways Participant no later than 60 calendar days prior to the end of the appointment about whether the agency is able to convert them. If an agency is unable to convert a Pathways Participant, its procedures may include the actions it will take to assist a Participant in pursuing conversion at another agency (when appropriate).
(10) Identify the minimum service-hour requirement that must be completed by an Intern as required by § 362.204.

Implementation of Pathways Policy requirement.
Agencies must establish a Pathways Policy that meets the criteria listed in paragraph (a) of this section not later than December 9, 2024. Upon June 11, 2024, agencies with existing Pathways memorandums of understanding (MOUs) may continue to use the Pathways Programs subject to the regulations in this part in lieu of an updated Pathways Policy while they are developing and updating their policies in accordance with the regulations in this part. Agencies without an existing MOU or an expired MOU on June 11, 2024, must establish an agency Pathways Policy before they begin making Pathways appointments. Agencies with MOUs that expire within 240 days of April 12, 2024, may request an extension of the MOU. All Pathways Programs MOUs will expire on December 9, 2024, unless OPM has specifically approved use of the MOU after December 9, 2024.
(c)
Revocation.
The Director may revoke an agency's authority to make Pathways appointments when agency use of these Programs is inconsistent with E.O. 13562, this part, or the agency's Pathways Policies.
[89 FR 25770, Apr. 12, 2024]
§ 362.105
Filling positions.
(a)
Workforce Planning.
Before filling any positions under these Programs, agencies should include measures in their workforce planning to ensure that an adequate number of permanent positions will be available to convert Pathways Participants who successfully complete their Programs.
(b)
Announcements.
When an agency accepts applications from individuals outside its own workforce, it must provide OPM information concerning Pathways Programs job opportunities as provided in each Pathways Program. For the purposes of this paragraph, “agency” means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105 and the Government Printing Office. An Executive department may treat each of its bureaus or components (first major subdivision that is separately organized and clearly distinguished from other bureaus or components in work function and operation) as a separate agency or as part of one agency, but must do so consistent with its Delegated Examining Agreement.
(c)
Appointments.
(1) Agencies must fill positions under the Pathways Programs using the excepted service appointing authority provided by § 213.3402 (a), (b), or (c) of this chapter, as applicable.
(2) Agencies must follow the procedures of part 302 of this chapter when filling a position under a Pathways Program.
(3) Appointments are subject to all the requirements and conditions governing term, career, or career-conditional employment, including investigation to establish an appointee's qualifications and suitability.
(d)
Eligibility.
Except as set forth in this section, eligibility requirements for appointment under a Pathways Program are specified in each Pathways Program.
(e)
Citizenship.
(1) An agency may appoint a non-citizen provided that:
(i) The Pathways Participant is lawfully admitted to the United States as a permanent resident or is otherwise authorized to be employed; and
(ii) The agency is authorized to pay aliens under the annual Appropriations Act ban and any agency-specific enabling and appropriation statutes.
(2) A Pathways Participant must be a United States citizen to be eligible for noncompetitive conversion to the competitive service.
(f)
Employment of relatives.
In accordance with part 310 of this chapter, a Pathways Participant may work in the same agency with a relative when there is no direct reporting relationship and the relative is not in a position to influence or control the Participant's appointment, employment, promotion or advancement within the agency.
(g)
Length of Appointments.
Except as provided in subpart B, Recent Graduate and PMF appointments under this authority may not exceed 2 years plus any agency-approved extension of up to 120 days.
(h)
Terminations.
An agency may terminate a Pathways Participant for reasons including misconduct, poor performance, or suitability under the provisions of this chapter.
(i)
Performance and progress evaluation.
Each Participant must be placed on a performance plan, as prescribed by part 430 of this chapter or other applicable law or regulation, establishing performance elements and standards that are directly related to acquiring and demonstrating the various leadership, technical, and/or general competencies expected of the Participant, as well as the elements and standards established for the duties assigned.
(j)
Compensation.
The rules for setting pay upon the initial appointment of a Participant are governed by the pay administration rules of the pay system or pay plan of the Participant's position under the Pathways program. In determining the Participant's compensation, agencies may also use any applicable pay flexibilities available under that pay system or pay plan (e.g., recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives under part 575 of this chapter; student loan repayments under part 537; and, for General Schedule positions, special rates under part 530, subpart C, and the superior qualifications and special needs pay setting authority and the maximum payable rate rule under part 531, subpart B).
§ 362.106
Participant Agreement.
Agencies must execute a written Participant Agreement with each Pathways Participant that clearly identifies expectations, including but not limited to:
(a) A general description of duties;
(b) Work schedules;
(c) The length of the appointment and termination date;
(d) Mentorship opportunities;
(e) Training requirements as applicable;
(f) Evaluation procedures that will be used for the Participant;
(g) Requirements for continuation and successful completion of the Program; and
(h) Minimum eligibility requirements for noncompetitive conversion to term or permanent competitive service employment according to the requirements of the applicable Pathways Program.
§ 362.107
Conversion to the competitive service.
(a) Subject to any limits on conversion imposed by the Director, and in accordance with the provisions of each Pathways Program, an agency may noncompetitively convert an eligible Pathways Participant to a term or permanent competitive service position.
(b) A Pathways Participant who is noncompetitively converted to a competitive service term appointment may be subsequently converted noncompetitively to a permanent competitive service position.
(c)
Noncompetitive conversion.
(1) An Intern may be converted to a position within the employing agency or any other agency within the Federal Government.
(2) A Recent Graduate may be converted to a position within the employing agency or any other agency within the Federal Government. Conversion to position at a different agency is subject to § 362.305(c).
(3) A PMF may be converted within the employing agency or any other agency within the Federal Government. Conversion to position at a different agency is subject to § 362.409(c).
(d) The provisions of the career transition assistance programs in subparts B, F and G of part 330 of this chapter do not apply to conversions made under this part.
(e) Time spent serving as a Pathways Participant counts towards career tenure when the individual is noncompetitively converted to a permanent position in the competitive service upon completion of the Program, with or without an intervening term appointment, and without a break in service of one day.
(f) Though Pathways Participants are eligible for noncompetitive conversion to the competitive service upon successful completion of their Program and any other applicable conversion requirements, service in a Pathways Program confers no right to further employment in either the competitive or excepted service. An agency wishing to convert a Pathways Participant must therefore execute the required actions to do so.

§ 362.108
Program oversight.
(a) The Director may establish caps on the number of Pathways Participants who may be appointed or converted in any Pathways Program within a specific agency or throughout the Federal Government.
(b) The Director may establish such caps based on agency or Governmentwide use of the Pathways Programs, input from the Executive agencies, and consideration of the following:

§ 362.111
Severability.
Any provision of this part held to be invalid or unenforceable as applied to any person or circumstance shall be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to the provision permitted by law, including as applied to persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances, unless such holding is that the provision is invalid and unenforceable in all circumstances, in which event the provision shall be severable from the remainder of this part and shall not affect the remainder thereof.

(e)
Promotion.
An agency may promote an Intern, on an initial appointment expected to last more than one year (without a not to exceed (NTE) date) who meets the qualification requirements for the position.

# Subpart C—Recent Graduates Program
§ 362.301
Program administration.
The Recent Graduates Program provides an entry-level developmental experience designed to lead to a civil service career in the Federal Government after successfully completing 1 year under the Program, unless the training requirements of the position warrant a longer and more structured training program. Employment under the Recent Graduates Program may not exceed 2 years plus any agency approved extension of up to an additional 120 days. Individuals appointed under this authority are referred to as Recent Graduates. An agency wishing to participate in the Recent Graduates Program must:
(a) Identify in its Pathways Policy the duration of its Recent Graduates
Program, including any criteria used to determine the need for a longer and more structured training program that exceeds 1 year;
(b) Ensure, within 90 days of appointment, that each Recent Graduate is assigned a mentor who is an employee outside the Recent Graduates' chain of command;
(c) Ensure, within 45 days of appointment, that each Recent Graduate has an Individual Development Plan (IDP) that is approved by his or her supervisor; and
(d) Provide at least 40 hours of formal interactive training per year that advances the goals and competencies outlined in each Recent Graduate's IDP. Mandatory annual training, such as information security and ethics training, does not count towards the 40-hour requirement.

Such a conversion to another agency may not be due to issues related to failure to obtain certification from the agency's Executive Resources Board, misconduct, poor performance, or suitability;
(2) Conversion must occur on or before the end of the agency prescribed Program period, plus any agency-approved extension; and

§ 370.101
Purpose.
(a) The purpose of this part is to implement sections 209(b)(6) and (c) of the E-Government Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-347), which authorize the Office of Personnel Management to establish an Information Technology Exchange Program. This statute authorizes the temporary detail of information technology employees between the Federal Government and private sector organizations. The statute also gives Federal agencies the authority to accept private sector information technology employees detailed under the Information Technology Exchange Program.
(b) Agency heads, or their designees, may approve details as a mechanism for improving the Federal workforce's competency in using information technology to deliver Government information and services. Details under this part allow Federal employees to serve with private sector organizations for a limited time period without loss of employee rights and benefits. Agencies may not make details under this part to circumvent personnel ceilings, or as a substitute for other more appropriate personnel decisions or actions. Approved details must meet the strategic program goals of the agency. The benefits to the Federal agency and the private sector organization are the primary considerations in initiating details; not the desires or personal needs of an individual employee.

In determining whether to provide training under this section, agencies should take into account:
(1) Agency authority to modify qualification requirements in certain situations as provided in the OPM Operating Manual for Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions;
(2) Agency authority to establish training programs that provide intensive and directly job-related training to substitute for all or part of the experience (but not education, licensing, certification, or other specific credentials), required by OPM qualification standards.

(c)
Training for placement in other agency positions, in other agencies, or outside Government
—(1)
Grade or pay retention.
Under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4103 and 5 U.S.C. 5364, an agency may train an employee to meet the qualification requirements of another position in the agency if the new position is at or below the retained grade or the grade of the position the employee held before pay retention.
(2)
Training for placement in another agency.
Under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4103(b), and consistent with merit system principles set forth in 5 U.S.C. 2301, an agency may train an employee to meet the qualification requirements of a position in another agency if the head of the agency determines that such training would be in the interest of the Government.

(C) The benefits to the Government which would result from retaining the employee in the Federal service.
(3)
Training displaced or surplus employees.
Displaced or surplus employees as defined in 5 CFR 330.602 may be eligible for training or retraining for positions outside Government through programs provided under 29 U.S.C. 1651, or similar authorities.

(a) An agency may authorize training for an employee to obtain an academic degree under conditions prescribed at 5 U.S.C. 4107(a).
(b) Colleges and universities participating in an academic degree training program must be accredited by a nationally recognized body. A “nationally recognized body” is a regional, national, or international accrediting organization recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.

(c) The selection of employees for an academic degree training program must follow the requirements of § 335.103(b)(3), § 335.103(c)(1)(iii), and subpart A of part 300 of this chapter. The selection and assignment must be accomplished to meet one or more of the criteria identified in 5 U.S.C. 4107(a). Therefore, an agency may competitively select and assign an employee to an academic degree training program that qualifies the employee for promotion to a higher graded position or
to a position that requires an academic degree.
(d) Agency heads must assess and maintain records on the effectiveness of training assignments under this section.
(e) On a periodic basis, OPM may request agency information on the use and effectiveness of training assignments under this section.

[61 FR 66193, Dec. 17, 1996; 63 FR 72097, Dec. 31, 1998, as amended at 69 FR 33277, June 15, 2004]
§ 410.310
Computing time in training.
For the purpose of computing time in training for continued service agreements under section 4108 of title 5, United States Code:
(a) An employee on an 8-hour day work schedule assigned to training is counted as being in training for the same number of hours he or she is in pay status during the training assignment. If the employee is not in pay status during the training, the employee is counted as being in training for the number of hours he or she is granted leave without pay for the purpose of the training.
(b) For an employee on an alternative work schedule, the agency is responsible for determining the number of hours the employee is in pay status during the training assignment. If the employee is not in pay status during the training, the employee is counted as being in training for the number of hours he or she is granted leave without pay for the purpose of the training.
(c) An employee on an 8-hour or an alternative work schedule assigned to training on less than a full-time basis is counted as being in training for the number of hours he or she spends in class, in formal computer-based training, in satellite training, in formal self-study programs, or with the training instructor, unless a different method is determined by the agency.
(d) When an employee is pursuing an academic degree through an agency academic degree training program, an agency may compute the length of the academic degree training period based on the academic institution's established contact hours.

(1)
Continuation of premium pay.
An employee given training during a period of duty for which he or she is already receiving premium pay for overtime, night, holiday, or Sunday work shall continue to receive that premium pay. This exception does not apply to an employee assigned to full-time training at institutions of higher learning.
(2)
Training at night.
An employee given training at night because situations that he or she must learn to handle occur only at night shall be paid by the applicable premium pay.
(3)

(4)
Availability pay.
An agency shall continue to pay availability pay during agency-sanctioned training to a criminal investigator who is eligible for it under 5 U.S.C. 5545a and implementing regulations. Agencies may, at their discretion, provide availability pay to investigators during periods of initial, basic training. (See 5 CFR 550.185 (b) and (c).)

§ 410.403
Payments for temporary duty training assignments.
Section 4109(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code, provides that an agency may pay, or reimburse an employee for, all or a part of the necessary expenses of training, including the necessary costs of travel; per diem expenses; or limited relocation expenses including transportation of the immediate family, household goods and personal effects:
(a) If an agency chooses to pay per diem, or in unusual circumstances the actual subsistence, expenses for an employee on a temporary duty training assignment, payment must be in accordance with 41 CFR part 301-7 or 41 CFR part 301-8 (or, for commissioned officers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in accordance with sections 404 and 405 of title 37, United States Code, and the Joint Federal travel Regulations for the Uniformed Services).
(b) An agency may pay a reduced per diem rate, such as a standardized payment less than the maximum per diem rate for a geographical area. If a reduced or standardized per diem rate was not authorized in advance of the travel and the fees paid to a training institution include lodging or meal costs, an appropriate deduction shall be made from the total per diem rate payable on the travel voucher (see 41 CFR 301-7.12).
(c) An agency may pay limited relocation expenses for the transportation of the employee's immediate family, household goods and personal effects, including packing, crating, temporarily storing, draying, and unpacking the household goods in accordance with section 5724 of title 5, United States Code (or, for commissioned officers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in accordance with sections 406 and 409 of title 37, United States Code, and the Joint federal travel Regulations for the uniformed Services). Limited relocation expenses are payable only when the estimated costs of transportation and related services are less than the estimated aggregate per diem or actual subsistence expense payments for the period of training. An employee selected for temporary duty training may receive travel and per diem (or actual subsistence expenses) for the period of the assignment or payment of limited relocation expenses, but not both.
[61 FR 66193, Dec. 17, 1996; 61 FR 66821, Dec. 30, 1996]
§ 410.404
Determining if a conference is a training activity.

# Subpart E—Accepting Contributions, Awards, and Payments From Non-Government Organizations
§ 410.501

(b) This subpart does not limit the authority of an agency head to establish procedures on the acceptance of contributions, awards, and payments in connection with any training and meetings that are outside the scope of this subpart in accordance with laws and regulations governing Government ethics and governing acceptance of travel reimbursements from non-Federal sources.
[61 FR 66193, Dec. 17, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 16877, Apr. 7, 1998]
§ 410.502

(1) The conditions specified in section 4111 of title 5, United States Code, are met; and
(2) In the judgment of the agency head, the following two conditions are met:
(i) The contribution, award, or payment is not a reward for services to the organization prior to the training or meeting; and
(ii) Acceptance of the contribution, award, or payment:
(A) Would not reflect unfavorably on the employee's ability to carry out official duties in a fair and objective manner;
(B) Would not compromise the honesty and integrity of Government programs or of Government employees and their official actions or decisions;

(1) Selects the recipient; and
(2) Administers the funds from which the contribution, award, or payment is made.
§ 410.503
Records.
An agency shall maintain, in such form and manner as the agency head considers appropriate, the following records in connection with each contribution, awards, or payment made and accepted under authority of this section: The recipient's name; the organization's name; the amount and nature of the contribution, award, or payment and the purpose for which it is to be used; and a copy of the written authorization required by § 410.502(a).

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 412.101
Coverage.
This part applies to all incumbents of, and candidates for, supervisory, managerial, and executive positions in the General Schedule, the Senior Executive Service (SES), or equivalent pay systems also covered by part 410 of this chapter.
§ 412.102
Purpose.
(a) This part implements for supervisors, managers, and executives the provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 41, related to training, and 5 U.S.C. 3396, related to the criteria for programs of systematic development of candidates for the SES and the continuing development of SES members.
(b) This part identifies a continuum of leadership development, starting with supervisory positions and proceeding through management and executive positions Governmentwide. For this reason, this part provides requirements by which agencies:
(1) Develop the competencies needed by supervisors, managers, and executives;
(2) Provide learning through continuing development and training in the context of succession planning; and
(3) Foster a broad agency and Governmentwide perspective to prepare individuals for advancement, thus supplying the agency and the Government with an adequate number of well-prepared and qualified candidates to fill leadership positions.

# Subpart B—Succession Planning
§ 412.201
Management succession.
The head of each agency, in consultation with OPM, must develop a comprehensive management succession program, based on the agency's workforce succession plans, to fill agency supervisory and managerial positions. These programs must be supported by employee training and development programs. The focus of the program should be to develop managers as well as strengthen organizational capability, and to ensure an adequate number of well-prepared and qualified candidates for leadership positions. These programs must:
(a) Implement developmental training consistent with agency succession management plans;
(b) Provide continuing learning experiences throughout an employee's career, such as details, mentoring, coaching, learning groups, and projects. These experiences should provide broad knowledge and practical experience linked to OPM's Federal leadership competencies, as well as agency-identified, mission-related competencies, and should be consistent with the agency's succession management plan; and
(c) Include program evaluations pursuant to 5 CFR 410.202.
§ 412.202
Systematic training and development of supervisors, managers, and executives.
All agencies must provide for the development of individuals in supervisory, managerial and executive positions, as well as individuals whom the agency identifies as potential candidates for those positions, based on the agencies' succession plans. Agencies also must issue written policies to ensure they:
(a) Design and implement leadership development programs integrated with the employee development plans, programs, and strategies required by 5 CFR 410.201, and that foster a broad agency and Governmentwide perspective;
(b) Provide training within one year of an employee's initial appointment to a supervisory position and follow up periodically, but at least once every three years, by providing each supervisor and manager additional training on the use of appropriate actions, options, and strategies to:
(1) Mentor employees;
(2) Improve employee performance and productivity;
(3) Conduct employee performance appraisals in accordance with agency appraisal systems; and
(4) Identify and assist employees with unacceptable performance.
(c) Provide training when individuals make critical career transitions, for instance from non-supervisory to manager or from manager to executive. This training should be consistent with assessments of the agency's and the individual's needs.

# Subpart C—Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Programs
§ 412.301
Obtaining approval to conduct a Senior Executive Service candidate development program (SESCDP).
(a) An SESCDP is an OPM-approved training program designed to develop the executive qualifications of employees with strong executive potential to qualify them for and authorize their initial career appointment in the SES. An agency conducting an SESCDP may submit program graduates for Qualifications Review Board (QRB) review of their executive qualifications under 5 CFR 317.502. A program graduate certified by a QRB may receive an initial career appointment without further competition to any SES position for which he or she meets the professional and technical qualifications requirements.
(b) An agency covered by subchapter II of chapter 31 of title 5, United States Code, may apply to OPM to conduct an SESCDP alone or on behalf of a group of agencies. (In this subpart, the term “agency” refers to either a single agency or a group of agencies acting in partnership under this subpart.) Any agency developing an SESCDP must submit a policy document describing its program methodologies to OPM for formal approval before implementing the SESCDP. An agency must seek OPM approval every five years thereafter, and must also consult OPM before implementing a change substantially altering how the SESCDP complies with the requirements of this regulation. An agency implementing an SESCDP without first obtaining formal approval may not submit graduates of the program for QRB review.
(c) An agency that obtained OPM approval under previous regulations must apply for re-approval in accordance with requirements in paragraph (b) and this subpart before initiating a new SESCDP. All existing SESCDP approvals expire within 2 years after publication of this regulation.
(d) An agency covered by subchapter II of chapter 31 of title 5, United States Code, may authorize a major agency component employing senior executives to apply directly to OPM for approval to conduct an SESCDP. Such an application from a component must be accompanied by the agency's written endorsement. To obtain approval, the component must meet the SESCDP requirements of this subpart independent of agency involvement.
(e) As always, agencies should be mindful of merit principles in carrying out their functions under this subpart.
§ 412.302
Criteria for a Senior Executive Service candidate development program (SESCDP).
(a)
Executive Resources Board requirements.
An agency's Executive Resources Board (ERB) must oversee the SESCDP. The ERB ensures the development program lasts a minimum of 12 months and includes substantive developmental experiences that should equip a successful candidate to accomplish Federal Government missions as a senior executive. The agency ERB must oversee and be accountable for SESCDP recruitment, merit staffing, and assessment. The agency ERB must ensure the program follows SES merit staffing provisions in 5 CFR 317.501, subject to the condition explained in § 412.302(d)(1) of this part. The ERB also must oversee development, evaluation, progress in the program, and graduation of candidates, and submit for QRB review within 90 workdays of graduation those candidates determined by the ERB to possess the executive core qualifications. The ERB must also oversee the writing and implementation of a removal policy for program candidates who do not make adequate progress.
(b)
Recruitment.
In recruiting, the agency, consistent with the merit system principles in 5 U.S.C. 2301 (b)(1) and (2), takes into consideration the goal of achieving a diversified workforce. Recruitment for the program is from all groups of qualified individuals within the civil service, or all groups of qualified individuals whether or not within the civil service. The number of expected SES vacancies must be considered as one factor in determining the number of selected candidates.
(c)
Senior Executive Service candidate development program requirements.
An SESCDP lasts a minimum of 12 months. To graduate, a candidate must accomplish the requirements of the program established by his or her agency. Each individual participating in an SESCDP must have:
(1) A documented development plan based upon a competency-based needs determination and approved by the agency ERB. The components of the development plan must:
(i) Address the executive core qualifications (ECQs);
(ii) Address Federal Government leadership challenges crucial to the senior executive;
(iii) Provide increased knowledge and understanding of the overall functioning of the agency, so the participant is prepared for a range of positions and responsibilities;
(iv) Include interaction with senior employees outside the candidate's department or agency to foster a broader perspective; and
(v) Have Governmentwide or multi-agency applicability in the nature and scope of the training;
(2) A formal interagency and/or multi-sector training experience lasting at least 80 hours that addresses the ECQs and their application to SES positions Governmentwide. The training experience must include interaction with senior employees outside the candidate's department or agency;
(3) A developmental assignment of at least 4 months of full-time service to include at least one assignment of 90 continuous days in a position other than, and substantially different from, the candidate's position of record. The assignment must include executive-level responsibility and differ from the candidate's current and past assignments in ways that broaden the candidate's experience, as well as challenge the candidate with respect to leadership competencies and the ECQs. Assignments need not be restricted to the agency, the Executive Branch, or the Federal Government, so long as they can be accomplished in compliance with applicable law and Federal and agency specific ethics regulations. The candidate is held accountable for organizational or agency results achieved during the assignment. If the assignment is in a non-Federal organization, the ERB must provide for adequate documentation of the individual's actions and accomplishments and must determine the assignment will contribute to development of the candidate's executive qualifications; and
(4) A mentor who is a member of the SES or is otherwise determined by the ERB to have the knowledge and capacity to advise the candidate, consistent with goals of the SESCDP. The mentor
and the candidate are jointly responsible for a productive mentoring relationship; however, the agency must establish methods to assess these relationships and, if necessary, facilitate them or make appropriate changes in the interest of the candidate.
(d) An SESCDP is a training opportunity for which agencies must recruit consistent with merit system principles and paragraph (d)(1) of this section. An agency must provide procedures under which selections are made from among either all qualified persons or all qualified persons in the civil service. If selected, the individual participates in the agency's SESCDP.
(1) An individual who does not currently hold a career or career-type civil service appointment may only participate in an SESCDP by means of a Schedule B appointment authorized by 5 CFR 213.3202(j) to a full-time position created for developmental purposes connected with the SESCDP. Exercising its authority under § 302.101(c)(6) of this chapter, OPM hereby exempts these full-time positions created for developmental purposes connected with the SESCDP from the appointment procedures of part 302 of this chapter. Competition for these appointments must be conducted pursuant to SES merit staffing procedures at § 317.501 of this chapter, except agencies must follow the principle of veterans' preference as far as administratively feasible, in accordance with § 302.101(c) of this chapter. Candidates serving under this Schedule B appointment may not be used to fill an agency's regular positions on a continuing basis.
(2) An individual who currently holds a career or career-type appointment in the civil service must be selected through SES merit staffing procedures at § 317.501 of this chapter. Subject to the approval of the agency in which the selectee is employed, such an individual may be selected for and participate in an SESCDP in any agency while serving in his or her position of record. The individual may continue to participate in the SESCDP upon moving to other civil service positions under career or career-type appointment, assuming the employing agency approves. An SESCDP competition does not satisfy the requirements of part 335 of this chapter and therefore does not provide an independent basis to appoint or promote a career or career-type appointee.
(3) A career or career-type appointee may participate in an SESCDP conducted by an agency other than his or her employing agency under such terms as are mutually agreeable and outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by both agencies involved. The MOU should be submitted to OPM after the candidate is selected and before the program begins. Terms of the MOU must be consistent with applicable provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 41, and a copy must be provided to OPM. Either agency may decline or discontinue a candidate's participation if such terms cannot be negotiated or are not fulfilled.
(4) Any candidate's participation in an SESCDP is at the discretion of the employing agency and subject to provisions established under 5 CFR 412.302(a) for removing a participant who does not make adequate progress in the program.
(5) For purposes of this paragraph (d), a “career-type” appointment means a career or career-conditional appointment or an appointment of equivalent tenure. An appointment of equivalent tenure is considered to be an appointment in the excepted service that is placed in Group I or Group II under section 351.502(b).

# Subpart D—Executive Development
§ 412.401
Continuing executive development.
(a) Each agency must establish a program or programs for the continuing development of its senior executives in accordance with 5 U.S.C 3396(a). Such agency programs must include preparation, implementation, and regular updating of an Executive Development Plan (EDP) for each senior executive. The EDPs will:
(1) Function as a detailed guide of developmental experiences to help SES members, through participation in short-term and longer-term experiences, meet organizational needs for leadership, managerial improvement, and organizational results;
(2) Address enhancement of existing executive competencies and such other competencies as will strengthen the executive's performance;
(3) Outline developmental opportunities and assignments to allow the individual to develop a broader perspective in the agency as well as Governmentwide; and
(4) Be reviewed annually and revised as appropriate by an ERB or similar body designated by the agency to oversee executive development, using input from the performance evaluation cycle.
(b) Consistent with 5 U.S.C. 3396(d) and other applicable statutes, EDPs may provide for executive sabbaticals and other long-term assignments outside the Federal sector.

§ 430.201
General.
(a)
Statutory authority.
Chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code, provides for the establishment of agency performance appraisal systems and requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to prescribe regulations governing such systems. The regulations in this subpart in combination with statute set forth the requirements for agency performance appraisal system(s) and program(s) for employees covered by subchapter I of chapter 43.
(b)
Savings provision.
The performance appraisal system portion of an agency's Performance Management Plan approved by OPM as of September 22, 1995 shall constitute an approved performance appraisal system under the regulations in this subpart until such time changes to the system are approved. No provision of the regulations in this subpart shall be applied in such a way as to affect any administrative proceeding related to any action taken under regulations in this chapter pending on September 22, 1995.
(c)
Equivalent ratings of record.
(1) If an agency has administratively adopted and applied the procedures of this subpart to evaluate the performance of its employees, the ratings of record resulting from that evaluation are considered ratings of record for reduction in force purposes.
(2) Other performance evaluations given while an employee is not covered by the provisions of this subpart are considered ratings of record for reduction in force purposes when the performance evaluation—
(i) Was issued as an officially designated evaluation under the employing agency's performance evaluation system,
(ii) Was derived from the appraisal of performance against expectations that are established and communicated in advance and are work related, and
(iii) Identified whether the employee performed acceptably.
(3) When the performance evaluation does not include a summary level designator and pattern comparable to those established at § 430.208(d), the agency may identify a level and pattern based on information related to the appraisal process.

Definitions.
In this subpart, terms are defined as follows:
Additional performance element
means a dimension or aspect of individual, team, or organizational performance that is not a critical or non-critical element. Such elements are not used in assigning a summary level but, like critical and non-critical elements, are
useful for purposes such as communicating performance expectations and serving as the basis for granting awards. Such elements may include, but are not limited to, objectives, goals, program plans, work plans, and other means of expressing expected performance.
Appraisal
means the process under which performance is reviewed and evaluated.
Appraisal period
means the established period of time for which performance will be reviewed and a rating of record will be prepared.
Appraisal program
means the specific procedures and requirements established under the policies and parameters of an agency appraisal system.
Appraisal system
means a framework of policies and parameters established by an agency as defined at 5 U.S.C. 4301(1) for the administration of performance appraisal programs under subchapter I of chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code, and this subpart.
Critical element
means a work assignment or responsibility of such importance that unacceptable performance on the element would result in a determination that an employee's overall performance is unacceptable. Such elements shall be used to measure performance only at the individual level.
Non-critical element
means a dimension or aspect of individual, team, or organizational performance, exclusive of a critical element, that is used in assigning a summary level. Such elements may include, but are not limited to, objectives, goals, program plans, work plans, and other means of expressing expected performance.
Performance
means accomplishment of work assignments or responsibilities.
Performance appraisal system:
See
Appraisal system.
Performance plan
means all of the written, or otherwise recorded, performance elements that set forth expected performance. A plan must include all critical and non-critical elements and their performance standards.
Performance rating
means the written, or otherwise recorded, appraisal of performance compared to the performance standard(s) for each critical and non-critical element on which there has been an opportunity to perform for the minimum period. A performance rating may include the assignment of a summary level within a pattern (as specified in § 430.208(d)).
Performance standard
means the management-approved expression of the performance threshold(s), requirement(s), or expectation(s) that must be met to be appraised at a particular level of performance. A performance standard may include, but is not limited to, quality, quantity, timeliness, and manner of performance.
Progress review
means communicating with the employee about performance compared to the performance standards of critical and non-critical elements.
Rating of record
means the performance rating prepared at the end of an appraisal period for performance of agency-assigned duties over the entire period and the assignment of a summary level within a pattern (as specified in § 430.208(d)), or (2) in accordance with § 531.404(a)(1) of this chapter. These constitute official ratings of record referenced in this chapter.

(1) Within 60 days of issuance based upon an informal request by the employee;
(2) As a result of a grievance, complaint, or other formal proceeding permitted by law or regulation that results in a final determination by appropriate authority that the rating of record must be changed or as part of a
bona fide
settlement of a formal proceeding; or
(3) Where the agency determines that a rating of record was incorrectly recorded or calculated.
(j) A performance rating may be prepared at such other times as an appraisal program may specify for special circumstances including, but not limited to, transfers and performance on details.

Chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code, provides for the establishment of Senior Executive Service (SES) performance appraisal systems and appraisal of senior executive performance. This subpart prescribes regulations for managing SES performance to implement the statutory provisions at 5 U.S.C. 4311-4315.
(b)
Purpose.
In order to improve the overall performance of Government, agencies must establish performance management systems that hold senior executives accountable (within their assigned areas of responsibility and control) for their individual performance and for organizational performance by—
(1) Encouraging excellence in senior executive performance;
(2) Aligning executive performance plans with the results-oriented goals required by the Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) or other strategic planning initiatives;
(3) Setting and communicating individual and organizational goals and expectations that clearly fall within the executive's area of responsibility and control;
(4) Reporting on the success of meeting organizational goals (including any factors that may have impacted success);
(5) Systematically appraising senior executive performance using measures that balance organizational results with customer and employee perspectives, and other perspectives as appropriate; and
(6) Using performance appraisals as a basis for pay, awards, development, retention, removal, and other personnel decisions.
(c)
Savings provision.
Agencies without OPM approval to use the basic SES appraisal system issued by U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget on January 4, 2012, must design, obtain
OPM approval for, and implement systems conforming to the requirements of this subpart no later than one year after October 26, 2015. No provision of this subpart will affect any administrative proceedings related to any action initiated under a provision of this chapter before October 26, 2015.
§ 430.302

In this subpart—
Agency
means an agency as that term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(1) and an Office of Inspector General, which is a separate agency for all provisions of the Senior Executive Service under the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App 6(d)).
Annual summary rating
means the overall rating level that an appointing authority assigns at the end of the appraisal period after considering (1) the initial summary rating, (2) any input from the executive or a higher level review, and (3) the applicable Performance Review Board's recommendations. This is the official final rating for the appraisal period.
Appointing authority
means the department or agency head, or other official with authority to make appointments in the Senior Executive Service (SES).
Appraisal period
means the established period of time for which a senior executive's performance will be appraised and rated.
Critical element
means a key component of an executive's work that contributes to organizational goals and results and is so important that unsatisfactory performance of the element would make the executive's overall job performance unsatisfactory.
Initial summary rating
means an overall rating level the supervisor derives, from appraising the senior executive's performance during the appraisal period in relation to the critical elements and performance standards and requirements, and forwards to the Performance Review Board.
Oversight official
means the agency head or the individual specifically designated by the agency head who provides oversight of the performance management system and issues performance appraisal guidelines.
Performance
means the accomplishment of the work described in the senior executive's performance plan.
Performance appraisal
means the review and evaluation of a senior executive's performance against critical elements and performance standards and requirements.
Performance management system
means the framework of policies and practices that an agency establishes under subchapter II of chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code, subpart A, and this subpart for planning, monitoring, developing, evaluating, and rewarding both individual and organizational performance and for using resulting performance information in making personnel decisions.
Performance requirement
means a description of what a senior executive must accomplish, or the competencies demonstrated, for a critical element. A performance requirement establishes the criteria to be met to be rated at a specific level of performance and generally includes quality, quantity, timeliness, cost savings, manner of performance, or other factors.
Performance standard
means a normative description of a single level of performance within five such described levels of performance ranging from unsatisfactory performance to outstanding performance. Performance standards provide the benchmarks for developing performance requirements against which actual performance will be assessed.
Progress review
means a review of the senior executive's progress in meeting the performance requirements. A progress review is not a performance rating.
Senior executive performance plan
means the written critical elements and performance requirements against which performance will be evaluated during the appraisal period by applying the established performance standards. The plan includes all critical elements,
performance standards, and performance requirements, including any specific goals, targets, or other measures established for the senior executive.

(b) Supervisors must develop performance plans in consultation with senior executives and communicate the plans to them in writing, including through the use of automated systems, on or before the beginning of the appraisal period.
(c) A senior executive performance plan must include—
(1)
Critical elements.
Critical elements must reflect individual performance results or competencies as well as organizational performance priorities within each executive's respective area of responsibility and control, and be based on OPM-validated executive competencies.
(2)
Performance standards.
Performance plans must include the performance standards describing each level of performance at which a senior executive's performance can be appraised. Performance standards describe the general expectations that must be met to be rated at each level of performance and provide the benchmarks for developing performance requirements.

(1) Results achieved in accordance with agency mission and strategic planning initiatives;
(2) Overall quality of performance rendered by the executive,
(3) Performance appraisal guidelines that must be based upon assessments of the agency's performance and are provided by the oversight official to senior executives, rating and reviewing officials, PRB members, and appointing authorities at the conclusion of the appraisal period and before completion of the initial summary ratings;
(4) Customer perspectives;
(5) Employee perspectives;
(6) The effectiveness, productivity, and performance results of the employees for whom the senior executive is responsible;

§ 430.309
Rating performance.
(a) When rating senior executive performance, each agency must—
(1) Comply with the requirements of this section, and
(2) Establish a PRB as described at § 430.311.
(b) Each performance management system must provide that an appraisal and rating for a career appointee's performance may not be made within 120 days after the beginning of a new President's term.
(c) When an agency cannot prepare an annual summary rating at the end of the appraisal period because the senior executive has not completed the minimum appraisal period or for other reasons, the agency must extend the executive's appraisal period. Once the appropriate conditions are met, the agency will then prepare the annual summary rating.
(d) Senior executive performance appraisals and ratings are not appealable.
(e) Procedures for rating senior executives must provide for the following:
(1)
Initial summary rating.
The supervisor must develop an initial summary rating of the senior executive's performance, in writing, including through the use of automated systems, and share that rating with the senior executive. The senior executive may respond in writing.
(2)
Higher-level review (HLR).
A senior executive may ask for a higher-level official to review the initial summary rating before the rating is given to the PRB. The agency must provide each senior executive an opportunity for review of the initial summary rating by an employee, or (with the consent of the senior executive) a commissioned officer in the uniformed services on active duty in the agency, in a higher level in the agency.
(i) A single review by an official at a higher level who did not participate in determining the executive's initial summary rating will satisfy this requirement. An official providing HLR may not change the initial summary rating but may recommend a different rating to the PRB. HLR may be provided by an official who is at a higher level in the agency than the appointing authority who will approve the final rating under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(ii) When an agency cannot provide review by a higher-level official for an executive who receives an initial summary rating from the agency head because no such official exists in the agency, the agency must offer an alternative review as it determines appropriate, except that the review may not be provided by a member of the PRB or an official who participated in determining the initial summary rating.
(iii) If a senior executive declines review by agency-designated higher-level officials, the agency may offer an alternative review but it not obligated to do so. The agency must document the executive's declination of the HLR opportunity provided by the agency before offering an alternative review.
(iv) Copies of findings and recommendations of the HLR official or the official performing an alternative review under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) through (iii) of this section must be given to the senior executive, the supervisor, and the PRB.
(3)
PRB review.
The PRB must receive and review the initial summary rating, the senior executive's response to the initial rating if made, and findings and recommendations of any HLR or any alternative review under paragraph (e)(2) of this section before making recommendations to the appointing authority, as provided in § 430.311.
(4)
Annual summary rating.
The appointing authority must assign the annual summary rating of the senior executive's performance after considering the applicable PRB's recommendations. This rating is the official final rating for the appraisal period and
must be communicated to the executive in writing, including through the use of automated systems, in accordance with the timelines developed under § 430.308(a).
(5)
Shortened appraisal periods.
The procedures of this section apply whenever an agency terminates an appraisal period under § 430.304(b)(5).
§ 430.310
Details and job changes.
(a) When a senior executive is detailed or temporarily reassigned for 120 days or longer, the gaining organization must set performance goals and requirements for the detail or temporary assignment. The gaining organization must appraise the senior executive's performance in writing, including through the use of automated systems, and this appraisal must be considered when deriving the initial summary rating.
(b) When a senior executive is reassigned or transferred to another agency after completing the minimum appraisal period, the supervisor must appraise the executive's performance in writing, including through the use of automated systems, before the executive leaves and provide this information to the executive.
(c) The most recent annual summary rating and any subsequent appraisals must be transferred to the gaining agency or organization. The gaining supervisor must consider the rating and appraisals when deriving the initial summary rating at the end of the appraisal period.
§ 430.311
Performance Review Boards (PRBs).
Each agency must establish one or more PRBs to make recommendations to the appointing authority on the performance of its senior executives.
(a)
Membership.
(1) Each PRB must have three or more members who are appointed by the agency head, or by another official or group acting on behalf of the agency head. Agency heads are encouraged to consider diversity and inclusion in establishing their PRBs.
(2) PRB members must be appointed in a way that assures consistency, stability, and objectivity in SES performance appraisal.
(3) When appraising a career appointee's performance or recommending a career appointee for a performance-based pay adjustment or performance award, more than one-half of the PRB's members must be SES career appointees.
(4) The agency must publish notice of PRB appointments in the
Federal Register
before service begins.
(b)
Functions.
(1) Each PRB must consider agency performance as communicated by the oversight official through the performance appraisal guidelines when reviewing and evaluating the initial summary rating, any senior executive's response, and any higher-level official's findings and recommendations on the initial summary rating or the results of an alternative review. The PRB may conduct any further review needed to make its recommendations. The PRB may not review an initial summary rating to which the executive has not been given the opportunity to respond in writing, including through the use of automated systems.
(2) The PRB must make a written recommendation, including through the use of automated systems, to the appointing authority about each senior executive's annual summary rating, performance-based pay adjustment, and performance award.
(3) PRB members may not take part in any PRB deliberations involving their own appraisals, performance-based pay adjustments, and performance awards.
§ 430.312
Using performance results.
(a) Agencies must use performance appraisals as a basis for adjusting pay, granting awards, retaining senior executives, and making other personnel decisions. Performance appraisals also will be a factor in assessing a senior executive's continuing development needs.
(b) Agencies are required to provide appropriate incentives and recognition (including pay adjustments and performance awards under part 534, subpart D) for excellence in performance.
(c) A career executive may be removed from the SES for performance reasons, subject to the provisions of part 359, subpart E, as follows:
(1) An executive who receives an unsatisfactory annual summary rating must be reassigned or transferred within the SES, or removed from the SES;

(3) An executive who receives less than a fully successful annual summary rating twice in any 3-year period must be removed from the SES.
§ 430.313
Training and evaluation.
(a) To assure effective implementation of agency performance management systems, agencies must provide appropriate information and training to agency leadership, supervisors, and senior executives on performance management, including planning and appraising performance.
(b) Agencies must periodically evaluate the effectiveness of their performance management system(s) and implement improvements as needed. Evaluations must provide for both assessment of effectiveness and compliance with relevant laws, OPM regulations, and OPM performance management policy.
(c) Agencies must maintain all performance-related records for no fewer than 5 years from the date the annual summary rating is issued, as required in 5 CFR 293.404(b)(1).
§ 430.314
OPM review of agency systems.
(a) Agencies must submit proposed SES performance management systems to OPM for approval. Agency systems must address the system standards and requirements specified in this subpart.
(b) OPM will review agency systems for compliance with the requirements of law, OPM regulations, and OPM performance management policy, including the system standards specified at § 430.305.
(c) If OPM finds that an agency system does not meet the requirements and intent of subchapter II of chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code, or of this subpart, OPM will identify the requirements that were not met and direct the agency to take corrective action, and the agency must comply.

§ 430.401
Purpose.
(a) This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 5307(d), as added by section 1322 of the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 (Title XIII of Public Law 107-296, the Homeland Security Act of 2002; November 25, 2002), which provides a higher aggregate limitation on pay for certain members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) under 5 U.S.C. 5382 and 5383 and employees in senior-level (SL) and scientific or professional (ST) positions paid under 5 U.S.C. 5376. In addition, this subpart is necessary to administer rates of basic pay for members of the SES under 5 U.S.C. 5382, as amended by section 1125 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004. The regulations in this subpart strengthen the application of pay-for-performance principles to senior executives and senior professionals. Specifically, the statutory provisions authorize an agency to apply a higher maximum rate of basic pay for senior executives (consistent with 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective) and apply a higher aggregate limitation on pay (consistent with 5 CFR part 530, subpart B) to its senior employees, but only after OPM, with OMB concurrence, has certified that the design and application of the agency's appraisal systems for these employees make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance. This subpart establishes the certification criteria and procedures that OPM will apply in considering agency requests for such certification.
(b) Senior executives generally may receive an annual rate of basic pay up to the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5382 and 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective. Senior employees generally may receive total compensation in a calendar year up to the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C.
5307(a) and 5 CFR 530.203(a). Only employees covered by an appraisal system that OPM, with OMB concurrence, certifies under this subpart are eligible for a maximum annual rate of basic pay for senior executives up to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule (consistent with 5 U.S.C. 5382 and 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective) and a higher aggregate pay limitation equivalent to the total annual compensation payable to the Vice President (consistent with 5 U.S.C. 5307(d) and 5 CFR 530.203(b)).

§ 430.403
System certification.
(a) The performance appraisal system(s) covering senior employees must be certified by OPM, with OMB concurrence, as making meaningful distinctions based on relative performance before an agency may apply a maximum annual rate of basic pay for senior executives equal to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule or apply an annual aggregate limitation on payments to senior employees equal to the salary of the Vice President under 5 U.S.C. 5307(d)). OPM, with OMB concurrence, will certify an agency's appraisal system(s) only when a review of that system's design, application, and administration reveals that the agency meets the certification criteria established in § 430.404 and has followed the procedures for certifying agency appraisal systems in § 430.405.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, agencies subject to 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 and 5 CFR part 430 seeking certification of their appraisal
systems must submit systems that have been approved by OPM under § 430.312 or § 430.210, as applicable. In some agencies, the performance appraisal system(s) covers employees in many organizations and/or components, and their ability to meet the certification criteria in § 430.404 may vary significantly. In such cases, an agency may establish and/or submit separate performance appraisal systems for each of these distinct organizations and/or components to ensure timely certification of those performance appraisal system(s) that meet the criteria. New appraisal systems established under 5 CFR part 430, subpart B or C, as applicable based on the employees covered, must be approved by OPM.
(c) When an agency establishes a new appraisal system for the purpose of seeking certification under this subpart, the agency may submit that system for certification even if it has not yet been approved by OPM under § 430.312 or § 430.210, as applicable. OPM will certify, with OMB concurrence, only those systems that OPM determines meet the approval requirements of 5 CFR part 430, subpart B or C, as applicable.
(d) An agency must establish an appraisal system(s), as defined in § 430.402, for its senior professionals that meets the requirements of 5 CFR part 430, subpart B, and is separate from the system(s) established to cover its SES members under 5 CFR part 430, subpart C. For the purpose of certification under this subpart, such senior professional appraisal system(s) must meet the certification criteria set forth in § 430.404. At its discretion, an agency may include system features in its senior professional appraisal system(s) that are the same as, or similar to, the features of its SES appraisal system(s), as appropriate, including procedures that correspond to the higher level review procedures under § 430.308(b) and PRB reviews of summary ratings under § 430.308(c).
(e) For agencies subject to 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 and 5 CFR part 430, OPM approval of the agency performance appraisal system(s) is a prerequisite to certification. Agencies not subject to the appraisal provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 and 5 CFR part 430 and which are seeking certification of their appraisal system(s) under this subpart must submit appropriate documentation to demonstrate that each system complies with the appropriate legal authority that governs the establishment, application, and administration of that system.
§ 430.404
Certification criteria.
(a) To be certified, an agency's applicable appraisal system(s) for senior executives or senior professionals must make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance and meet the other requirements of 5 U.S.C. chapter 43, as applicable, in addition to the particular criterion cited here (
i.e.
, consultation). Such system(s) must provide for the following:
(1) Alignment, so that the performance expectations for individual senior employees derive from, and clearly link to, the agency's mission, GPRA strategic goals, program and policy objectives, and/or annual performance plans and budget priorities;
(2) Consultation, so that the performance expectations for senior employees meet the requirements of 5 CFR part 430, subparts B and C, as applicable, and/or other applicable legal authority; are developed with the input and involvement of the individual senior employees who are covered thereby; and are communicated to them at the beginning of the applicable appraisal period, and/or at appropriate times thereafter;
(3) Results, so that the performance expectations for individual senior employees apply to their respective areas of responsibility; reflect expected agency and/or organizational outcomes and outputs, performance targets or metrics, policy/program objectives, and/or milestones; identify specific programmatic crosscutting, external, and partnership-oriented goals or objectives, as applicable; and are stated in terms of observable, measurable, and/or demonstrable performance;
(4) Balance, so that in addition to expected results, the performance expectations for individual senior employees include appropriate measures or indicators of employee and/or customer/
stakeholder feedback; quality, quantity, timeliness, and cost effectiveness, as applicable; and those technical, leadership and/or managerial competencies or behaviors that contribute to and are necessary to distinguish outstanding performance;
(5) Appropriate assessments of the agency's performance—overall and with respect to each of its particular missions, components, programs, policy areas, and support functions—such as reports of the agency's GPRA goals, annual performance plans and targets, program performance measures, and other appropriate indicators, as well as evaluation guidelines based, in part, upon those assessments, that are communicated by the agency head, or an individual specifically designated by the agency head for such purpose, to senior employees, appropriate senior employee rating and reviewing officials, and PRB members. These assessments and guidelines are to be provided at the conclusion of the appraisal period but before individual senior employee performance ratings are recommended, so that they may serve as a basis for individual performance evaluations, as appropriate. The guidance provided may not take the form of quantitative limitations on the number of ratings at any given rating level, and must conform to 5 CFR part 430, subpart B or C, as applicable;
(6) Oversight by the agency head or the individual specifically designated under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, who certifies, for a particular senior employee appraisal system, that—
(i) The senior employee appraisal process makes meaningful distinctions based on relative performance;
(ii) The results of the senior employee appraisal process take into account, as appropriate, the agency's assessment of its performance against program performance measures, as well as other relevant considerations; and
(iii) Pay adjustments, cash awards, and levels of pay based on the results of the appraisal process accurately reflect and recognize individual performance and/or contribution to the agency's performance;
(7) Accountability, so that final agency head decisions and any PRB recommendations regarding senior employee ratings consistent with 5 CFR part 430, subparts B and C, individually and overall, appropriately reflect the employee's performance expectations, relevant program performance measures, and such other relevant factors as the PRB may find appropriate; in the case of supervisory senior employees, ratings must reflect the degree to which performance standards, requirements, or expectations for individual subordinate employees clearly link to organizational mission, GPRA strategic goals, or other program or policy objectives and take into account the degree of rigor in the appraisal of their subordinate employees;
(8) Performance differentiation, so that the system(s) includes at least one summary level of performance above fully successful, including a summary level that reflects outstanding performance, as defined in § 430.402, and so that its annual administration results in meaningful distinctions based on relative performance that take into account the assessment of the agency's performance against relevant program performance measures, as described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, employee performance expectations, and such other relevant factors as may be appropriate. Relative performance does not require ranking senior employees against each other; such ranking is prohibited for the purpose of determining performance ratings. For equivalent systems that do not use summary ratings, the appraisal system must provide for clear differentiation of performance at the outstanding level; and
(9) Pay differentiation, so that those senior employees who have demonstrated the highest levels of individual performance and/or contribution to the agency's performance receive the highest annual summary ratings or ratings of record, as applicable, as well as the largest corresponding pay adjustments, cash awards, and levels of pay, particularly above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. Agencies must provide for transparency in the processes for making pay decisions, while assuring confidentiality.
(b) Consistent with the requirements in section 3(a) of the Inspector General
Act of 1978, an agency's Inspector General or an official he or she designates must perform the functions listed in paragraphs (a)(5) and (6) of this section for senior employees in the Office of the Inspector General.
§ 430.405
Procedures for certifying agency appraisal systems.
(a)
General.
To receive system certification, an agency must provide documentation demonstrating that its appraisal system(s), in design, application, and administration, meets the certification criteria in § 430.404 as well as the procedural requirements set forth in this section.
(b)
Certification requests.
In order for an agency's appraisal system to be certified, the head of the agency or designee must submit a written request for full or provisional certification of its appraisal system(s) to OPM. Certification requests may cover an agencywide system or a system that applies to one or more agency organizations or components and must include—
(1) A full description of the appraisal system(s) to be certified, including—
(i) Organizational and employee coverage information;
(ii) Applicable administrative instructions and implementing guidance; and
(iii) The system's use of rating levels that are capable of clearly differentiating among senior employees based on appraisals of their relative performance against performance expectations in any given appraisal period reflecting performance evaluation results that make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance, and which include—
(A) For the agency's senior executives covered by 5 CFR part 430, subpart C, at least four, but not more than five, summary rating levels—an outstanding level, a fully successful level, an optional level between outstanding and fully successful, a minimally satisfactory level, and an unsatisfactory level;
(B) For the agency's senior professionals covered by 5 CFR part 430, subpart B, at least three, but not more than five, summary levels—an outstanding level, a fully successful level, an optional level between outstanding and fully successful, an unacceptable level, and an optional level between fully successful and unacceptable; and
(C) For agencies not subject to 5 CFR part 430, subparts B and C, a summary rating level that reflects outstanding performance or a methodology that clearly differentiates outstanding performance, as defined in § 430.402;
(2) A clearly defined process for reviewing—
(i) The initial summary ratings and ratings of record, as applicable, of senior employees to ensure that annual summary ratings or ratings of record are not distributed arbitrarily or on a rotational basis, and
(ii) In the case of senior employees with supervisory responsibilities—
(A) The performance standards, requirements, or expectations for the employees they supervise to ensure that they clearly link to organizational mission, GPRA strategic goals, or other program and policy objectives, as appropriate, and
(B) The performance standards, requirements, or expectations and the performance ratings of the employees they supervise to ensure that they reflect distinctions in individual and organizational performance, as appropriate;
(3) Documentation showing that the appraisal system(s) meets the applicable certification criteria, as follows:
(i) For provisional certification, the requirements in § 430.404(a)(1)-(4); and
(ii) For full certification, all of the requirements in § 430.404.
(4) For full certification, data on senior executive annual summary ratings and senior professional ratings of record, as applicable (or other documentation for agencies that do not use summary ratings), for the two appraisal periods preceding the request, as well as corresponding pay adjustments, cash awards, and levels of pay provided to those senior employees; and
(5) Any additional information that OPM and OMB may require to make a determination regarding certification.
(c)
Certification actions.
At the request of an agency, the Director of OPM, at his or her discretion and in accordance with the requirements of this subpart and with OMB concurrence,
may grant full or provisional certification of the agency's appraisal system(s). OPM, with OMB concurrence, may—
(1) Grant full certification of an agency's senior employee appraisal system(s) for 2 calendar years when an agency has demonstrated that it has designed and fully implemented and applied an appraisal system(s) for its senior executives or senior professionals, as applicable, that meets the certification criteria in § 430.404 and the documentation requirements of this section.
(2) Grant provisional certification of an agency's senior employee appraisal system(s) for 1 calendar year when an agency has designed, but not yet fully implemented or applied, an appraisal system(s) for its senior executives or senior professionals, as applicable, that meets the certification criteria in § 430.404. OPM may extend provisional certification into the following calendar year in order to permit an agency to take any actions needed to adjust pay based on annual summary ratings, ratings of record, or other performance appraisal results determined during the calendar year for which the system was certified; or
(3) Suspend certification under paragraph (h) of this section if, at any time during the certification period, OPM, with OMB concurrence, determines that the agency appraisal system is not in compliance with certification criteria.
(d)
Pay limitations.
Absent full or provisional certification of its appraisal system(s), an agency must—
(1) Set a senior executive's rate of basic pay at a rate that does not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule, consistent with 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective; and
(2) Limit aggregate compensation paid to senior employees in a calendar year to the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule, consistent with 5 CFR 530.203(b).
(e)
Full certification.
(1) OPM, with OMB concurrence, may grant full certification when a review of the agency's request and accompanying documentation demonstrates that the design, application, and administration of the agency's appraisal system(s) meet the criteria in § 430.404 and the documentation requirements of this section.
(2) An agency with a fully-certified appraisal system(s) may set the rate of basic pay under 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective, for a senior executive covered by a certified system at a rate that does not exceed the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule and pay senior employees covered by certified system(s) aggregate compensation in a certified calendar year in an amount up to the Vice President's salary under 3 U.S.C. 104.
(3) Full certification of an agency's appraisal system will be renewed automatically for an additional 2 calendar years, if—
(i) The agency meets the annual reporting requirements in paragraph (g) of this section; and
(ii) Based on those annual reports, OPM determines, and OMB concurs, that the appraisal system(s) continues to meet the certification criteria and procedural requirements set forth in this subpart.
(f)
Provisional certification.
(1) OPM, with OMB concurrence, may grant provisional certification when the design of an agency's appraisal system(s) for senior executives or senior professionals, as applicable, meets the requirements set forth in this subpart, but insufficient documentation exists to determine whether the actual application and administration of the appraisal system(s) meet the requirements for full certification. OPM, with OMB concurrence, may grant provisional certification to an agency more than once.
(2) During the 1-year period of provisional certification, an agency may set the rate of basic pay for a senior executive covered by the provisionally certified system at a rate that does not exceed the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule (consistent with 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective) and pay senior employees covered by provisionally certified systems aggregate compensation in the certified calendar year in an amount up to the Vice President's salary under 3 U.S.C. 104 (consistent with 5 CFR part 530, subpart B).
(3) An agency must resubmit an application requesting provisional certification for every calendar year for which it intends to maintain provisional certification. An agency with a provisionally certified appraisal system(s) may request that OPM, with OMB concurrence, grant full certification upon a showing that its performance appraisal systems for senior executives and senior professionals, as applicable, meet the certification criteria in § 430.404 and the documentation requirements in this section, particularly with respect to the implementation and administration of the system(s) over at least two consecutive performance appraisal periods.
(g)
Annual reporting requirement.
Agencies with certified appraisal systems must provide OPM with a general summary of the annual summary ratings and ratings of record, as applicable, and rates of basic pay, pay adjustments, cash awards, and aggregate total compensation (including any lump-sum payments in excess of the applicable aggregate limitation on pay that were paid in the current calendar year as required by § 530.204) for their senior employees covered by a certified appraisal system at the conclusion of each appraisal period that ends during a calendar year for which the certification is in effect, in accordance with OPM instructions.
(h)
Suspension of certification.
(1) When OPM determines that an agency's certified appraisal system is no longer in compliance with certification criteria, OPM, with OMB concurrence, may suspend such certification, as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(2) An agency's system certification is automatically suspended when OPM withdraws performance appraisal system approval or mandates corrective action because of misapplication of the system as authorized under §§ 430.210(c), 430.312(c), and 430.403(e).
(3) OPM will notify the head of the agency at least 30 calendar days in advance of the suspension and the reason(s) for the suspension, as well as any expected corrective action. Upon such notice, and until its system certification is reinstated, the agency must set a senior executive's rate of basic pay under 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective, at a rate that does not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. While certification is suspended, an agency must limit aggregate compensation received in a calendar year by a senior employee to the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule. Pay adjustments, cash awards, and levels of pay in effect prior to that notice will remain in effect unless OPM finds that any such decision and subsequent action was in violation of law, rule, or regulation.
(4) OPM, with OMB concurrence, may reinstate an agency's suspended certification only after the agency has taken appropriate corrective action.
(5) OPM may reinstate the certification of an appraisal system that has been automatically suspended under paragraph (h)(2) of this section upon the agency's compliance with the applicable OPM-mandated corrective action(s).

§ 432.104
Addressing unacceptable performance.
At any time during the performance appraisal cycle that an employee's performance is determined to be unacceptable in one or more critical elements, the agency shall notify the employee of the critical element(s) for which performance is unacceptable and inform the employee of the performance requirement(s) or standard(s) that must be attained in order to demonstrate acceptable performance in his or her position. The agency should also inform the employee that unless his or her performance in the critical element(s) improves to and is sustained at an acceptable level, the employee may be reduced in grade or removed. For each critical element in which the employee's performance is unacceptable, the agency shall afford the employee a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the employee's position. As part of the employee's opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, the agency shall offer assistance to the employee in improving unacceptable performance.
[87 FR 67782, Nov. 10, 2022]
§ 432.105
Proposing and taking action based on unacceptable performance.
(a)
Proposing action based on unacceptable performance.
(1) Once an employee has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance pursuant to § 432.104, an agency may propose a reduction-in-grade or removal action if the employee's performance during or following the opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance is unacceptable in one or more of the critical elements for which the employee was afforded an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance.
(2) If an employee has performed acceptably for 1 year from the beginning of an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance (in the critical element(s) for which the employee was afforded an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance), and the employee's performance again becomes unacceptable, the agency shall afford the employee an additional opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance before determining whether to propose a reduction in grade or removal under this part.
(3) A proposed action may be based on instances of unacceptable performance which occur within a 1 year period ending on the date of the notice of proposed action.
(4) An employee whose reduction in grade or removal is proposed under this part is entitled to:
(i)
Advance notice.
(A) The agency shall afford the employee a 30 day advance notice of the proposed action that identifies both the specific instances of unacceptable performance by the employee on which the proposed action is based and the critical element(s) of the employee's position involved in each instance of unacceptable performance.
(B) An agency may extend this advance notice period for a period not to exceed 30 days under regulations prescribed by the head of the agency. An agency may extend this notice period further without prior OPM approval for the following reasons:
(
1
) To obtain and/or evaluate medical information when the employee has raised a medical issue in the answer to a proposed reduction in grade or removal;
(
2
) To arrange for the employee's travel to make an oral reply to an appropriate agency official, or the travel of an agency official to hear the employee's oral reply;
(
3
) To consider the employee's answer if an extension to the period for an answer has been granted (e.g., because of the employee's illness or incapacitation);
(
4
) To consider reasonable accommodation of a disability;
(
5
) If agency procedures so require, to consider positions to which the employee might be reassigned or reduced in grade; or
(
6
) To comply with a stay ordered by a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board under 5 U.S.C. 1214(b)(1)(A) or (B).
(C) If an agency believes that an extension of the advance notice period is necessary for another reason, it may request prior approval for such extension from the Manager, Employee Accountability, Accountability and Workforce Relations, Employee Services, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW, Washington, DC 20415.
(ii)
Opportunity to answer.
The agency shall afford the employee a reasonable time to answer the agency's notice of proposed action orally and in writing.
(iii)
Representation.
The agency shall allow the employee to be represented by an attorney or other representative. An agency may disallow as an employee's representative an individual whose activities as a representative would cause a conflict of interest or position or an employee whose release from his or her official position would give rise to unreasonable costs to the Government or whose priority work assignment precludes his or her release from official duties.
(iv)
Consideration of medical conditions.
The agency shall allow an employee who wishes to raise a medical condition which may have contributed to his or her unacceptable performance to furnish medical documentation (as defined in § 339.102 of this chapter of the condition for the agency's consideration. Whenever possible, the employee shall supply this documentation following the agency's notification of unacceptable performance under § 432.104. If the employee offers such documentation after the agency has proposed a reduction in grade or removal, he or she shall supply this information in accordance with § 432.105(a)(4)(ii). In considering documentation submitted in connection with the employee's claim of a medical condition, the agency may require or offer a medical examination in accordance with the criteria and procedures of part 339 of this chapter, and shall be aware of the affirmative obligations of 29 CFR 1613.704. If the employee who raises a medical condition has the requisite years of service under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System, the agency shall provide information concerning application for disability retirement. As provided at § 831.501(d) of this chapter, an employee's application for disability retirement shall not preclude or delay any other appropriate agency decision or personnel action.
(b)
Final written decision.
The agency shall make its final decision within 30 days after expiration of the advance notice period. Unless proposed by the head of the agency, such written decision shall be concurred in by an employee who is in a higher position than the person who proposed the action. In arriving at its decision, the agency shall consider any answer of the employee and/or his or her representative furnished in response to the agency's proposal. A decision to reduce in grade or remove an employee for unacceptable performance may be based only on those instances of unacceptable performance that occurred during the 1 year period ending on the date of issuance of the advance notice of proposed action under § 432.105(a)(4)(i). The agency shall issue written notice of its decision to the employee at or before the time the action will be effective. Such notice shall specify the instances of unacceptable performance by the employee on which the action is based and shall inform the employee of any applicable appeal and/or grievance rights.

(b)
When the action is not effected.

Authority and coverage.
(a) Chapter 45 of title 5, United States Code authorizes agencies to pay a cash award to, grant time-off to, and incur necessary expense for the honorary recognition of, an employee (individually or as a member of a group) and requires the Office of Personnel Management to prescribe regulations governing such authority. Chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code, provides for recognizing and rewarding employees whose performance so warrants. The regulations in this subpart, in combination with chapters 43 and 45 of title 5, United States Code, and any other applicable law, establish the requirements for agency award programs.

Section 1 of E.O. 12828 (Delegation of Certain Personnel Management Authorities, January 5, 1993) delegates to the Office of Personnel Management the authority of the President to permit performance-based cash awards under 5 U.S.C. 4505a to be paid to categories of employees who would not be eligible otherwise.
(c) This subpart applies to employees as defined by section 2105 and agencies as defined by section 4501 of title 5, United States Code, except as provided in §§ 451.105 and 451.201(b).
(d) For the regulatory requirements for granting performance awards to Senior Executive Service (SES) employees under 5 U.S.C. 5384, refer to § 534.405 of this chapter.
(e) An agency may grant performance-based cash awards on the basis of a rating of record at the fully successful level (or equivalent) or above under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4505a and the provisions of this part to eligible non-GS employees who are covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 45 and this part and who are not otherwise covered by an explicit statutory authority for the payment of such awards, including 5 U.S.C. 5384 (SES performance awards).

(2) Documenting justification for awards that are not based on a rating of record (as defined in § 430.203 of this chapter).
[60 FR 43946, Aug. 23, 1995; 60 FR 47646, Sept. 13, 1995]
§ 451.104
Awards.
(a) An agency may grant a cash, honorary, or informal recognition award, or grant time-off without charge to leave or loss of pay consistent with chapter 45 of title 5, United States Code, and this part to an employee, as an individual or member of a group, on the basis of—
(1) A suggestion, invention, superior accomplishment, productivity gain, or other personal effort that contributes to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of Government operations or achieves a significant reduction in paperwork;
(2) A special act or service in the public interest in connection with or related to official employment; or
(3) Performance as reflected in the employee's most recent rating of record (as defined in § 430.203 of this chapter), provided that the rating of record is at the fully successful level (or equivalent) or above, except that performance awards may be paid to SES members only under § 534.405 of this chapter and not on the basis of this subpart.
(b) A cash award under this subpart is a lump sum payment and is not basic pay for any purpose.

(d) When an award is approved for—
(1) An employee of another agency, the benefiting agency shall make arrangements to transfer funds to the employing agency to cover the award.

(2) A member of the armed forces for a suggestion, invention, or scientific achievement, arrangements shall be made to transfer funds to the agency having jurisdiction over the member in accordance with E.O. 11438, “Prescribing Procedures Governing Interdepartmental Cash Awards to the Members of the Armed Forces”.
(e) An award may be granted to a separated employee or the legal heir(s) or estate of a deceased employee.
(f) A time-off award granted under this subpart shall not be converted to a cash payment under any circumstances.
(g) When granting an award paid as a percentage of basic pay under 5 U.S.C. 4505a(a)(2), the rate of basic pay used must include any applicable locality payment under 5 CFR part 531, subpart F; special rate supplement under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C; or similar payment or supplement under other legal authority. For an employee receiving a retained rate under 5 CFR part 536, subpart C (or similar authority, such as 5 CFR 359.705), the rate of basic pay is the maximum payable rate for the employee's grade or level, rather than the retained rate.
(h) Programs for granting performance-based cash awards on the basis of a rating of record at the fully successful level (or equivalent) or above, as designed and applied, must make meaningful distinctions based on levels of performance.

§ 470.101
Statutory authority.
(a) Section 4702, title 5, United States Code, provides the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) with the authority to:
(1) Establish and maintain, and assist in the establishment and maintenance of, research programs to study improved methods and technologies in Federal personnel management;
(2) Evaluate the research programs established under paragraph (a)(1) of this section;
(3) Establish and maintain a program for the collection and public dissemination of information relating to personnel management research, and for encouraging and facilitating the exchange of information among interested persons and entities; and
(4) Carry out the preceding functions directly or through agreement or contract.
(b) Section 4703, title 5, United States Code, provides OPM with the authority to conduct and evaluate demonstration projects to determine whether a specified change in personnel management policies or procedures would result in improved Federal personnel management.
(c) This part supplements and implements the provisions of chapter 47 of title 5, United States Code, relating to the conduct of personnel research programs and demonstration projects, and must be read together with those provisions of law.
§ 470.103
Definitions.
In this part:
Demonstration Project
means a project conducted by the Office of Personnel Management, or under its supervision, to determine whether a specified change in personnel management policies or procedures would result in improved Federal personnel management (5 U.S.C. 4701). The project must require the waiver of a provision of law, rule, or regulation which is eligible for waiver under the demonstration authority contained in 5 U.S.C. 4703. A project which can be undertaken under an agency's own authority and does not require the waiver of a provision of law, rule, or regulation is not considered a “demonstration project” for purposes of this part.
Research
means systematic, intensive study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. Activities classified as research are structured experimental or descriptive investigations conducted according to sound methodological principles.
Research Program
means a planned study of the manner in which public management policies and systems are operating or have operated, the effects of those policies and systems, the possibilities for change, and comparisons among policies and systems.

(d) Modifies or develops personnel management systems which improve the management of the Federal Government's human resources;
(e) Gathers, makes explicit, systematizes, and transmits the knowledge and techniques of practicing managers for the guidance of others and as a factual basis for research needs determination;
(f) Develops new methods or provides new standards for conducting personnel management research; or
(g) Designs systems for the assessment and transmittal of relevant personnel management strategies.
§ 470.203
Eligible parties.
Research may be conducted by the Office of Personnel Management, or under contract or agreement, as appropriate, by:
(a) Federal agencies;
(b) State and local governments;
(c) Institutions of higher education; or
(d) Other public or private institutions or organizations, profit or nonprofit.
§ 470.205
Initiation of research programs.
OPM will announce opportunities for research contracts by issuing Requests for Proposals (RFP's) in accordance with Federal procurement regulations. Unsolicited proposals may be accepted; however the relevance of the proposed research to OPM research needs will determine the acceptability of the proposal.

# Subpart C—Regulatory Requirements Pertaining to Demonstration Projects
§ 470.301
Program expectations.
(a) Demonstration projects permit the Office of Personnel Management and Federal agencies to test alternative personnel management concepts in controlled situations to determine the likely effects and ramifications of proposed changes before putting them into general effect.

(b) The demonstration project must be proposed in a research context. The project plan must include a research design which contains:
(1) Measurable goals or objectives;
(2) Acceptable expected results or outcomes;
(3) A description of the procedures, methods and techniques to be demonstrated in achieving the desired goals or objectives;
(4) An evaluation section describing the data collection and analysis procedures to be used to assess the success or failure of the project from a qualitative and quantitative standpoint; and
(5) An itemization of all costs and benefits associated with the project, to the agency, the Government, and the community.
(c) OPM may establish and maintain activities which publish, exchange and apply the results of demonstration projects.

§ 470.303
Eligible parties.
(a) Any Federal agency, or groups of two or more Federal agencies, eligible to propose demonstration projects under 5 U.S.C. 4701(a)(1) and 4701(b) may conduct demonstration projects after approval by the Office of Personnel Management and required Congressional and public review.
(b) While only a Federal agency may propose and conduct a demonstration project, the agency may be assisted in the development and evaluation of the project under contract or agreement with public or private institutions and organizations.
§ 470.305
Submission of proposals for demonstration projects.
(a) OPM will accept project proposals at any time. However, OPM may delay action for a reasonable amount of time on submitted proposals until comparisons can be made with other existing projects or with project proposals of a similar nature not yet received by OPM but known to be under development.
(b) Agencies must submit the project proposal in the form of a project plan to OPM for approval. OPM will prescribe the content of a project plan in its guidance and instructions, which at a minimum will contain the items identified in 5 U.S.C. 4703(b)(1) and 5 CFR 470.301(b).

(i) All employees who may be interested in or affected by the activities of the demonstration project; and
(ii) All labor organizations accorded exclusive recognition for bargaining units which include employees in or affected by the project plan.
(2) Certify to OPM in writing when and how the requirements of § 470.307(c)(1) were carried out and document the manner in which it insured that all affected employees were notified.
(3) Observe the consultation and negotiation requirements of 5 U.S.C. 4703 (f) and (g).
§ 470.309
Public hearing.
(a)
Notice of public hearing.
OPM shall hold a public hearing no less than 30 days after the date of its notice in the
Federal Register
during which interested persons or organizations may present their written or oral views concerning the proposed demonstration project. The notice of public hearing shall be published in the
Federal Register
and shall:
(1) State the date, time, place and purpose of the hearing;
(2) Describe briefly the project;
(3) Indicate where more information and a copy of the project plan may be obtained;
(4) State the name and address of the person who will receive written comments from those unable to attend the hearing; and
(5) Indicate the date by which written comments must be received to be considered.
(b)
Nature of public hearing.

(a) The Office of Personnel Management will consider all timely relevant oral and written views, arguments, and data before final approval or disapproval of a project plan. OPM may request that the agency modify the tentatively approved project plan before final approval because of comments and data received from the Congress, the public, labor organizations, and affected employees. OPM will not permit the agency to implement the project until all required consultation or negotiation has been completed, including the conclusion of impasse resolution and negotiability disputes.
(b) The Office of Personnel Management shall provide a copy of the final version of the project plan to each House of the Congress at least 90 days in advance of the date the project is to take effect.
(c) Agencies involved in the project shall communicate the content of the final project plan to:
(1) Labor organizations and affected employees; and
(2) Individuals and groups known to be interested in the project's activities.
§ 470.313
Project implementation regulations.
Agencies will prepare demonstration project implementing regulations, as appropriate, to replace Government-wide statutes and regulations waived for the project. Demonstration project implementing regulations issued pursuant to an OPM-approved demonstration project must be approved by OPM and shall have full force and authority
pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.
§ 470.315
Project modification and extension.
OPM-approved projects permit the testing of alternative personnel systems and procedures in accordance with the provisions of the project plan. The provisions of approved project plans will not be modified, duplicated in organizations not listed in the project plan, or extended by agencies to individuals or groups of employees not included in the project plan without the approval of the Office of Personnel Management. OPM will inform the agency of notification responsibilities under § 470.307. The extent of notification requirements will depend on the nature and extent of the requested project modification.
§ 470.317
Project evaluation.
(a)
Compliance evaluation.
OPM will review the operation of the project periodically to determine its compliance with the requirements of this part and the approved project plan. If OPM determines that an agency is not meeting legal, regulatory, or project plan requirements, it may, as appropriate, direct the agency to take corrective action or terminate the project.
(b)
Results evaluation.
All approved project plans will contain an evaluation section to measure the impact of the project results in relation to its objectives and to determine whether or not permanent changes in law and/or regulation should be considered or proposed. Where the project plan provides for agency evaluation of project results, OPM will review those project evaluation efforts, may conduct evaluations of its own, on a sample basis, to verify results, and may report its own conclusions. If OPM or the agency determines that an experiment is creating a substantial hardship on, or is not in the best interest of, the public, the Federal Government, employees, or eligibles, even though the experiment is being conducted properly, OPM or the agency may jointly or unilaterally terminate the project.

(2) An agency's proposed classification decision;
(3) The class, grade, or pay system of a position to which the employee is detailed or promoted on a time-limited basis, except that employees serving under time-limited promotion for 2 years or more may appeal the classification of their positions to the Office under these procedures.

§ 511.608
Employee representatives.
An employee may select a representative of his or her choice to assist in the preparation and presentation of an appeal. An agency may disallow an employee's representative when the individual's activities as a representative would cause a conflict of interest or position; an employee who cannot be released from his or her official duties because of the priority needs of the Government; or an employee whose release would give rise to unreasonable costs to the Government.

§ 511.611
Cancellation of an employee appeal.
An employee's appeal shall be cancelled and the employee so notified in writing in the following circumstances:
(a) On receipt of the employee's written request for cancellation.
(b) On failure to prosecute, when the employee or the designated representative does not furnish requested information, or proceed with the advancement of the appeal.
The Office may at its discretion reopen a cancelled appeal on a showing that circumstances beyond the control of the employee prevented pursuing the appeal.
§ 511.612
Finality of decision.
An appellate decision made by the Office is final unless reconsidered by the Office. There is no further right of appeal. The Office may reconsider a decision at its discretion. The decision shall constitute a certificate which is mandatory and binding on all administrative, certifying, payroll, disbursing, and accounting officials of the Government. Agencies shall review their own classification decisions for identical, similar or related positions to insure
consistency with the Office's certificate.
§ 511.613
Appeals reconsideration by the Office.
The Office may, at its discretion, reopen and reconsider a certificate issued under this subpart.
(a) Requests which contain new and material information, or disagreements over the significance of information, will be remanded to the Director's designee for a decision.
(b) The Office may reopen and reconsider a decision only when written argument or evidence is presented which establishes a reasonable doubt concerning the technical accuracy of the decision.
[71 FR 37489, June 30, 2006]

# Subpart G—Effective Dates of Position Classification Actions or Decisions

# Source:
46 FR 9915, Jan. 30, 1981, unless otherwise noted.
§ 511.701
Effective dates generally.
(a)
Agency classification actions.
(1) A classification action is a determination to establish or change the title, series, grade or pay system of a position based on application of published position classification standards or guides. This is a position action.
(i) The effective date of a position action taken by an agency shall be the date an official with properly delegated
authority approves (certifies) the proposed classification. This is accomplished when the authorized official(s) signs the allocation of the position.
(ii) The effective date of a position action may be extended to correspond with the effective date of the personnel action when:
(A) The position is being changed to lower grade or pay; and
(B) The employee occupying the position is eligible for retained grade or pay under 5 U.S.C. 5362-5363.
(2) A position action is implemented by a personnel action. The personnel action must occur within a reasonable period of time following the date of the position action.
(3) If the position action requires a personnel action which will result in a loss of grade or pay to the occupant of the position, the agency must advise the employee, in writing, of the position action and the proposed date of the personnel action. This notice shall be issued prior to taking a personnel action.
(4) Except as provided in § 511.703, classification actions may not be made retroactive.
(b)
Office of Personnel Management's classification decision.
(1) The effective date of a classification decision made by means of a certificate issued under the authority of section 5110, title 5, United States Code is not earlier than the date of the certificate, and not later than the beginning of the fourth pay period following the date of the certificate, unless a subsequent date is specifically stated in the certificate. Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph the filing of an appeal of such a certificate does not delay its effective date.
(2) The implementation of the certificate may be suspended when it is determined before its effective date that a review of the classification decision is warranted and suspension is desirable. The determination to suspend implementation may be made by the Director or the Director's designee. Suspending the implementation of a certificate does not automatically change the effective date except when the certificate requires that the grade or pay of the position be reduced and the employee is not entitled to retained grade or pay.
(3) When the original decision requires that the grade or pay of the position be reduced and the employee is not entitled to retained grade or pay the reviewing authority shall issue a new certificate if it sustains the original decision. Since demotions cannot be made retroactive, the effective date of the new certificate shall be not earlier than the date of the certificate, and not later than the beginning of the fourth pay period after the date of the certificate unless a subsequent date is specifically stated in the certificate.
[46 FR 9915, Jan. 30, 1981, as amended at 58 FR 65534, Dec. 15, 1993; 71 FR 37489, June 30, 2006]
§ 511.702
Agency or Office classification appeal decisions.
(a) Subject to § 511.703, the effective date of a change in the classification of a position resulting from a classification appeal decision by either an agency or the Office is not earlier than the date of the decision and not later than the beginning of the fourth pay period following the date of the decision, except when a subsequent date is specifically provided in the decision.
(b) The implementation of the decision may be suspended by the Office when it determines before the effective date that a review of the decision is warranted. The determination to suspend implementation may be made by the Director or the Director's designee. Suspending the implementation does not change the effective date of the decision except when the original decision requires that the grade or pay of the position be reduced and the employee is not entitled to grade or pay retention.
(c) When the original decision requires that the grade or pay of the position be reduced and the employee is not entitled to grade or pay retention, the reviewing authority, if sustaining the original decision, shall issue a new certificate and the effective date of the new certificate shall be not earlier than the date of the new decision and not later than the beginning of the fourth pay period following the date of the new decision, unless a subsequent
date is specifically stated in the new decision.
[46 FR 9915, Jan. 30, 1981, as amended at 71 FR 37489, June 30, 2006]
§ 511.703
Retroactive effective date.
(a)
Applicability.
A retroactive effective date may be required only if the employee is wrongfully demoted.
(b)
Downgrading.
(1) The effective date of a classification appellate certificate or agency appellate decision can be retroactive only if it corrects a classification action which resulted in a loss of grade or pay. In order for the decision to be made retroactive, the employee must file the initial request for review with either the agency or the Office not later than 15 calendar days after the effective date of the reclassification action.
(2) However, if the appellate decision raises the grade of the position above the original grade, retroactivity will apply only to the extent of restoration to the original grade.
(3) The right to a retroactive effective date provided by this section is preserved on subsequent appeals from an agency or Office classification decision when the subsequent appeal is filed not later than 15 calendar days following receipt of written notification of a final agency administrative decision or 15 calendar days after the effective date of the action taken as a result of the classification decision, whichever is later.
(c)
Grade change based on new duties and responsibilities.
Retroactivity may be based only on duties and responsibilities existing at the time of demotion and cannot be based on duties and responsibilities assigned later.
(d)
Retroactivity when time limits are extended.
The right to a retroactive effective date provided by this section may be preserved at the discretion of the Office, on a showing by the employee that he or she was not notified of the applicable time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that circumstances beyond his or her control prevented filing an appeal within the prescribed time limit.

# Subpart B—Aggregate Limitation on Pay

# Source:
69 FR 70360, Dec. 6, 2004, unless otherwise noted.
§ 530.201
Purpose.
This subpart establishes regulations for limiting an employee's aggregate annual compensation. An employee's aggregate compensation received in any given calendar year may not exceed the rate of pay for level I of the
Executive Schedule or the rate payable to the Vice President at the end of the calendar year, whichever is applicable to the employee based on the certification status under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D, of the performance appraisal system covering that employee. These regulations must be applied in conjunction with 5 U.S.C. 5307.
§ 530.202
Definitions.
In this subpart:
Agency
means an executive agency as defined at 5 U.S.C. 105.
Aggregate compensation
means the total of—
(1) Basic pay received as an employee of the executive branch or as an employee outside the executive branch to whom the General Schedule applies;
(2) Premium pay under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV;
(3) Premium pay under 5 U.S.C. chapter 55, subchapter V;
(4) Incentive awards and performance-based cash awards under 5 U.S.C. chapters 45 and 53;
(5) Recruitment and relocation incentives under 5 U.S.C. 5753 and retention incentives under 5 U.S.C. 5754;
(6) Extended assignment incentives under 5 U.S.C. 5757;
(7) Supervisory differentials under 5 U.S.C. 5755;
(8) Post differentials under 5 U.S.C. 5925;
(9) Danger pay allowances under 5 U.S.C. 5928;
(10) Post differentials based on environmental conditions for employees stationed in nonforeign areas under 5 U.S.C. 5941(a)(2);
(11) Physicians' comparability allowances under 5 U.S.C. 5948;
(12) Continuation of pay under 5 U.S.C. 8118;
(13) Lump-sum payments in excess of the aggregate limitation on pay as required by § 530.204; and
(14) Other similar payments authorized under title 5, United States Code, excluding—
(i) Overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and 5 CFR part 551;
(ii) Severance pay under 5 U.S.C. 5595;
(iii) Lump-sum payments for accumulated and accrued annual leave upon separation under 5 U.S.C. 5551 or 5552;
(iv) Back pay awarded to an employee under 5 U.S.C. 5596 because of an unjustified personnel action;
(v) Student loan repayments under 5 U.S.C. 5379; and
(vi) Nonforeign area cost-of-living allowances under 5 U.S.C. 5941(a)(1).
Aggregate limitation
means the limitation on aggregate compensation received in any given calendar year as established by 5 U.S.C. 5307. For an executive branch employee (including employees in Senior Executive Service positions paid under 5 U.S.C. 5383 and employees in senior-level or scientific or professional positions paid under 5 U.S.C. 5376), a General Schedule employee in the legislative branch, or General Schedule employee in the judicial branch (excluding those paid under 28 U.S.C. 332(f), 603, and 604), the limitation on aggregate compensation is equal to the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule in effect at the end of the applicable calendar year. For an employee in a Senior Executive Service position paid under 5 U.S.C. 5383 and an employee in a senior-level or scientific or professional position paid under 5 U.S.C. 5376 covered by an applicable performance appraisal system that has been certified under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D, the limitation on aggregate compensation is equal to the total annual compensation payable to the Vice President under 3 U.S.C. 104 at the end of a calendar year.
Basic pay
means the total amount of pay received at a rate fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee, including any special rate under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or any locality-based comparability payment under 5 CFR part 531, subpart F, or other similar payment under other legal authority, before any deductions.
Basic pay
includes night and environmental differentials for prevailing rate employees under 5 U.S.C. 5343(f) and 5 CFR 532.511.
Basic pay
excludes additional pay of any other kind.
Discretionary payment
means a payment an agency has discretion to make to an employee. Payments that are authorized to be made to an employee under the terms of a service agreement
or preauthorized to be made to an employee at a regular fixed rate each pay period are not
discretionary payments.
Employee
has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105.
Estimated aggregate compensation
means the agency's projection of the aggregate compensation an employee actually would receive during a calendar year but for application of the aggregate limitation to future payments. This projection must be based upon known factors. Estimated aggregate compensation includes—
(1) The total amount of basic pay the employee will receive during the calendar year;
(2) Any lump-sum payment of excess amounts from a previous calendar year, as described in § 530.204;
(3) The total amount of nondiscretionary payments the employee would be entitled to receive during the calendar year; and
(4) The total amount of discretionary payments the employee would be authorized to receive during the calendar year.
[69 FR 70360, Dec. 6, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 25739, May 13, 2005; 72 FR 67837, Dec. 3, 2007]
§ 530.203
Administration of aggregate limitation on pay.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no executive branch employee or General Schedule employee in the legislative branch (or General Schedule employee in the judicial branch, excluding those paid under 28 U.S.C. 332(f), 603, and 604), may receive any allowance, differential, bonus, award, or other similar cash payment under title 5, United States Code, in any calendar year which, in combination with the employee's basic pay (whether received under title 5, United States Code, or otherwise), would cause the employee's aggregate compensation to exceed the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule on the last day of that calendar year (
i.e.
, the aggregate limitation).
(b)(1) Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an employee in a Senior Executive Service position paid under 5 U.S.C. 5383 and an employee in a senior-level or scientific or professional position paid under 5 U.S.C. 5376 may not receive any allowance, differential, bonus, award, or other similar cash payment under title 5, United States Code, in any calendar year which, in combination with the employee's basic pay, would cause the employee's aggregate compensation to exceed the rate of pay for level I of the Executive Schedule.
(2) An employee covered by a performance appraisal system that has been certified under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D, may not receive any allowance, differential, bonus, award, or other similar cash payment under title 5, United States Code, in any calendar year which, in combination with the employee's basic pay, would cause the employee's aggregate compensation to exceed the total annual compensation payable to the Vice President under 3 U.S.C. 104 on the last day of that calendar year (
i.e.
, the aggregate limitation).
(3) An agency must make corrective actions as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section if the agency underestimated or overestimated an employee's aggregate compensation in a calendar year as a result of receiving or losing certification of its applicable performance appraisal system under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D.
(c) The aggregate limitations described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to the aggregate compensation an employee actually received during the calendar year without regard to when the compensation was earned.
(d) When an agency authorizes a discretionary payment for an employee, the agency must defer any portion of such payment that, when added to the estimated aggregate compensation the employee is projected to receive, would cause the employee's aggregate compensation during the calendar year to exceed the applicable aggregate limitation. Any portion of a discretionary payment deferred under this paragraph must be available for payment as provided in § 530.204. When a discretionary payment is authorized but not required to be paid in the current calendar year, an agency official's decision to set the payment date in the next calendar year is not considered a deferral under this paragraph.
(e) An agency may not defer or discontinue nondiscretionary payments for any period of time to make a discretionary payment that would otherwise cause an employee's pay to exceed the applicable aggregate limitation. An agency may not defer or discontinue basic pay under any circumstance.
(f) If, after an agency defers discretionary payments as required by paragraph (d) of this section, the estimated aggregate compensation to which an employee is entitled exceeds the applicable aggregate limitation, the agency must defer all nondiscretionary payments (other than basic pay) as necessary to avoid payments in excess of that limitation. An agency must defer all nondiscretionary payments at the time when otherwise continuing to pay such payments would cause an employee's estimated aggregate compensation for that calendar year to exceed the applicable aggregate limitation. An agency must pay any portion of a nondiscretionary payment deferred under this paragraph at a later date, as provided in § 530.204.
(g)(1) If an agency determines that it underestimated an employee's aggregate compensation at an earlier date in the calendar year, or the aggregate limitation applicable to the employee is reduced during the calendar year, the sum of the employee's remaining payments of basic pay may exceed the difference between the aggregate compensation the employee has actually received to date in that calendar year and the applicable aggregate limitation. In such cases, the employee will become indebted to the Federal Government for any amount paid in excess of the applicable aggregate limitation. The head of the agency may waive the debt under 5 U.S.C. 5584, if warranted.
(2) To the extent that any excess amount is attributable to amounts that should have been deferred and would have been payable at the beginning of the next calendar year, an agency must extinguish the excess amount on January 1 of the next calendar year. As part of the correction of the error, the agency must deem the excess amount to have been paid on January 1 of the next calendar year (when the debt was extinguished) as if it were a deferred excess payment, as described in § 530.204, and must consider this deemed deferred excess payment to be part of the employee's aggregate compensation for the new calendar year.
(h) If an agency determines that it overestimated an employee's aggregate compensation at an earlier date in the calendar year, which caused the agency to defer payments unnecessarily under this section, or the aggregate limitation applicable to the employee is increased during the calendar year, the agency may make appropriate corrective payments to the employee during the calendar year, notwithstanding § 530.204.
[69 FR 70360, Dec. 6, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 25740, May 13, 2005]
§ 530.204
Payment of excess amounts.
(a) An agency must pay the amounts that were deferred because they were in excess of the aggregate limitation (as described in § 530.203) as a lump-sum payment at the beginning of the following calendar year, except as otherwise provided in this section. This payment is part of the employee's aggregate compensation for the new calendar year.
(b) If a lump-sum payment under paragraph (a) of this section causes an employee's estimated aggregate compensation to exceed the aggregate limitation in the current calendar year, an agency must consider only the employee's basic pay that is expected to be paid in the current year in determining the extent to which the lump-sum payment may be paid. An agency must defer all other payments, as provided in § 530.203, in order to pay as much of the lump-sum excess amount as possible. Any payments deferred under this paragraph, including any portion of the lump-sum excess amount that was not payable, are payable at the beginning of the next calendar year, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) If an employee transfers to another agency, the gaining agency is responsible for making any lump-sum payment required by paragraph (a) of this section. The previous employing agency must provide the gaining agency with documentation regarding the employee's excess amount, as provided
in § 530.205. The previous employing agency must provide a fund transfer equal to the total cost of the lump-sum payment to the gaining agency through the Department of the Treasury's Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection System. If an employee leaves Federal service, the employing agency is responsible for making the lump-sum payment to the employee as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d) An agency must pay any excess amount regardless of the calendar year limitation under the following conditions:
(1) If an employee dies, the employing agency must pay the entire excess amount as part of the settlement of accounts, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5582.
(2) If an employee separates from Federal service, the employing agency must pay the entire excess amount following a 30-day break in service. If the individual is reemployed in the Federal service within the same calendar year as the separation, any previous payment of an excess amount must be considered part of that year's aggregate compensation for the purpose of applying the aggregate limitation for the remainder of the calendar year.
§ 530.205
Records.
An agency must maintain appropriate records to administer this subpart and must transfer such records to any agency to which an employee may transfer. An agency must make such records available to any agency that may employ the employee later during the same calendar year. An agency's records must document the source of any deferred excess amount remaining to the employee's credit at the time of separation from the agency. In the case of an employee who separates from Federal service for at least 30 days, the agency records also must document any payment of a deferred excess amount made by the agency after separation.

# General Provisions
§ 530.301
Purpose and applicability.
(a)
Purpose.
This subpart contains OPM regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5305, which authorizes the establishment of special rates of pay for Federal employees in executive agencies to address significant recruitment or retention problems. This subpart also contains rules for determining an employee's rate of pay when a special rate schedule is established, increased, decreased, or discontinued, or when conditions for coverage under a special rate schedule are changed. All other pay actions for special rate employees are governed by the pay-setting rules in 5 CFR parts 531 and 536.
(b)
Applicability.
Except as explained in § 530.303(a), this subpart applies only to GS employees.
§ 530.302
Definitions.
In this subpart:
Agency
means an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105.
Authorized agency official
means the head of the agency or an official who is authorized to act for the head of the agency in the matter concerned.
Employee
has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105.
General Schedule
or
GS
means the classification and pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53. It also refers to the pay schedule of GS rates established under 5 U.S.C. 5332, as adjusted under 5 U.S.C. 5303 or other law (including GS rates payable to GM employees). Law enforcement officers (LEOs) receiving LEO special base rates are covered by the GS classification and pay system, but receive higher base rates of pay in lieu of GS rates at grades GS-3 through GS-10.
GM employee
has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 531.203.
GS rate
means a rate of basic pay within the General Schedule, excluding
any LEO special base rate and additional pay of any kind such as locality payments or special rate supplements. A rate payable to a GM employee is considered a GS rate.
Highest applicable rate range
means the rate range applicable to an employee's position that provides the highest rates of basic pay, excluding any retained rates. For example, a rate range of special rates may exceed an applicable locality rate range. In certain circumstances, the
highest applicable rate range
may consist of two types of pay rates from different pay schedules—e.g., a range where special rates (based on a fixed dollar supplement) are higher in the lower portion of the range and locality rates are higher in the higher portion of the range.
Law enforcement officer
or
LEO
has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 550.103.
LEO special base rate
means a special base rate established for GS law enforcement officers at grades GS-3 through GS-10 under section 403 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub. L. 101-509, November 5, 1990, as amended) which is used in lieu of a GS rate.
Locality payment
has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 531.602.
Locality rate
means a GS rate or an LEO special base rate, if applicable, plus any applicable locality payment.
Official worksite
means the official location of an employee's position of record as determined under 5 CFR 531.605.
Official worksite
is synonymous with the term “official duty station” as used in 5 U.S.C. 5305(i).
OPM
means the Office of Personnel Management.
Pay schedule
means a set of rate ranges established for GS employees under a single authority—
i.e.
, the General Schedule, an LEO special base rate schedule (for grades GS-3 through 10), a locality rate schedule based on GS rates, a locality rate schedule based on LEO special base rates (for grades GS-3 through 10), a special rate schedule under this subpart, or a similar schedule under 38 U.S.C. 7455. A pay schedule applies to or covers a defined category of employees based on established coverage conditions (e.g., official worksite, occupation). A pay schedule is considered to apply to or cover an employee who meets the established coverage conditions even when a rate under that schedule is not currently payable to the employee because of a higher pay entitlement under another pay schedule.
Position of record
means an employee's official position (defined by grade, occupational series, employing agency, LEO status, and any other condition that determines coverage under a pay schedule (other than official worksite)), as documented on the employee's most recent Notification of Personnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent) and current position description. A position to which an employee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record. For an employee whose change in official position is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee's separation before he or she is required to report for duty in the new position, the position of record in effect immediately before the position change is deemed to remain the position of record through the date of separation.
Rate of basic pay
means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee before any deductions, including a GS rate, an LEO special base rate, a locality rate, a special rate under this subpart or a similar rate under 38 U.S.C. 7455, or a retained rate, but excluding additional pay of any other kind.
Rate range
or
range
means the range of rates of basic pay for a grade within an established pay schedule, excluding any retained rate. A rate range may consist of GS rates, LEO special base rates, locality rates, special rates, or similar rates under other legal authority.
Retained rate
means a rate above the maximum rate of the rate range applicable to the employee which is payable under 5 CFR part 536 or, for a former member of the Senior Executive Service, under 5 CFR 359.705.
Special rate
means a rate of pay within a special rate schedule established under this subpart.
Special rate schedule
means a pay schedule established under this subpart
to provide higher rates of pay for specified categories of GS positions or employees at one or more grades. An increased or decreased special rate schedule refers to an increase or decrease in one or more rate ranges within that schedule.
Special rate supplement
means the portion of a special rate paid above an employee's GS rate. However, for a law enforcement officer receiving an LEO special base rate who is also entitled to a special rate, the special rate supplement equals the portion of the special rate paid above the officer's LEO special base rate. When a special rate schedule covers both LEO positions and other positions, the value of the special rate supplement will be less for law enforcement officers receiving an LEO special base rate (since that rate is higher than the corresponding GS rate). The payable amount of a special rate supplement is subject to the Executive Schedule level IV limitation on special rates, as provided in § 530.304(a).
[70 FR 31287, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66151, Nov. 7, 2008]
§ 530.303
Coverage.
(a) Under 5 U.S.C. 5305, OPM may establish special rates for employees paid under a statutory pay system (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5302(1)) or any other pay system established by or under Federal statute for civilian positions in the executive branch. Special rates apply only to GS employees unless the approved schedule coverage criteria specifically state otherwise. OPM will establish special rate schedules covering employees under a non-GS pay system only at the request of the agency responsible for administering that system. For employees covered by a non-GS pay system, the responsible agency is subject to the requirements in 5 U.S.C. 5305. To the extent the statutory or regulatory provisions governing the non-GS pay system differ from the regulatory provisions of this subpart, the responsible agency must follow policies that are consistent as possible with this subpart.
(b) An employee's coverage under a special rate schedule is subject to the coverage conditions established by OPM for that schedule, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The coverage conditions for a special rate schedule may be based on occupation, grade, employing agency, geographic location of official worksite, or other factors OPM may determine to be appropriate. An agency determination as to whether an employee meets the coverage conditions for a special rate schedule must be based on the employee's position of record and official worksite. An agency also may be required to consider other employee-specific factors established by OPM to determine special rate coverage, such as special qualifications or certifications.
(c) An agency must pay the applicable special rate to any employee who meets the coverage conditions established by OPM with respect to a special rate schedule unless an authorized agency official determines that a category of employees of the agency will not be covered by a proposed or existing special rate schedule, subject to the following requirements:
(1) An authorized agency official may determine that a category of employees of the agency will not be covered by a special rate request or a proposed new special rate schedule. The official must provide written notice to OPM that identifies the specific category or categories of employees who will not be covered by the special rate schedule. The notice must be received by OPM before the effective date of the new special rate schedule.
(2) An authorized agency official may remove a category of employees of the agency from coverage under an existing special rate schedule. The official must provide written notice to OPM that identifies the specific category or categories of employees who will not be covered by the special rate schedule. The loss of coverage under a special rate schedule will become effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the date of the notice to OPM.
(d) An employee covered by a special rate schedule is not entitled to a special rate for any purpose with respect to any period during which the employee is entitled to a higher rate of basic pay under any other legal authority. For example, an employee is not entitled to a special rate if he or she is
entitled to a higher locality rate or a retained rate.
§ 530.304
Establishing or increasing special rates.
(a) OPM may increase the minimum rates of pay otherwise payable to a category of employees in one or more areas or locations, grades or levels, occupational groups, series, classes, or subdivisions thereof, when it is necessary to address existing or likely significant recruitment or retention difficulties. OPM will consider the circumstances listed in paragraph (b) of this section and the factors listed in § 530.306 when evaluating the need for special rates. When OPM establishes a minimum special rate under this authority, corresponding increases also may be made in one or more of the remaining rates of the affected grade or level. For any given grade, a minimum special rate may not exceed the maximum rate of basic pay for the rate range (excluding any locality rate, other special rate, or similar payment under other legal authority) by more than 30 percent. A special rate may not exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule.
(b) The circumstances considered by OPM in evaluating the need for special rates are the following:
(1) Rates of pay offered by non-Federal employers which are significantly higher than those payable by the Government within the area, location, occupational group, or other category of positions under GS pay system;
(2) The remoteness of the area or location involved;
(3) The undesirability of the working conditions or the nature of the work involved (including exposure to toxic substances or other occupational hazards);
(4) Locality pay authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5304 for the area involved;
(5) A nonforeign area cost-of-living allowance authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5941(a)(1) for the area involved; or
(6) Any other circumstances OPM considers appropriate.
(c) In setting the level of special rates within a rate range for a category of employees, OPM will compute the special rate supplement by adding a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage to all GS rates within that range, except that an alternate method may be used—
(1) For grades GS-1 and GS-2, where within-grade increases vary throughout the range; and
(2) In the nonforeign areas listed in 5 CFR 591.205 for special rate schedules established before January 1, 2012.
(d) If OPM establishes a special rate schedule that covers only law enforcement officers, OPM may compute the special rate supplement for grades GS-3 through 10 as a fixed percentage of LEO special base rates instead of GS rates. With respect to such a schedule, references to GS rates in § 530.307 are deemed to be references to LEO special base rates.
(e) Using its authority in section 1918(a)(1) of the Non-Foreign Area Retirement Equity Assurance Act of 2009 in combination with its authority under 5 U.S.C. 5305, OPM may establish a separate special rate schedule for a category of employees who are in GS positions covered by a nonforeign area special rate schedule in effect on January 1, 2012, and who are employed in a nonforeign area before an OPM-specified effective date. Such a separate schedule may be established if the existing special rate schedule is being reduced. An employee's coverage under the separate special rate schedule is contingent on the employee being continuously employed in a covered GS position in the nonforeign area after the OPM-specified effective date. Such a separate special rate schedule must be designed to provide temporary pay protection and be phased out over time until all affected employees are covered under the pay schedule that would otherwise apply to the category of employees in question.
[70 FR 31287, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66151, Nov. 7, 2008; 76 FR 68633, Nov. 7, 2011]
§ 530.305
Agency requests for new or increased special rates.
(a) An agency may request that a special rate schedule be established or increased or that its employees be covered by an existing special rate schedule at any time. An authorized agency official in the agency headquarters office must submit to OPM any request
to establish or increase special rates for a category of agency employees. The request must include a certification by the authorized agency official that the requested special rates are necessary to ensure adequate staffing levels to accomplish the agency's mission.
(b) The authorized agency official is responsible for submitting complete supporting data for any request for new or higher special rates. OPM may require that the supporting data include a survey of prevailing non-Federal pay rates in the relevant labor market.
(c) OPM may coordinate an agency special rate request with other agencies that have similar categories of employees. OPM may designate a lead agency to assist in coordinating the collection of relevant data. Each affected agency is responsible for submitting complete supporting data upon request to OPM or the lead agency, as appropriate, unless the agency determines that a category of its employees will not be covered by the proposed special rate schedule, as provided in § 530.303(c).
§ 530.306
Evaluating agency requests for new or increased special rates.
(a) In evaluating agency requests for new or increased special rates, OPM may consider the following factors:
(1) The number of existing vacant positions and the length of time they have been vacant;
(2) The number of employees who have quit (
i.e.
, voluntarily left Federal service), including, when available, a subcount of the number of employees who quit to take a comparable position offering higher pay;
(3) Evidence to support a conclusion that recruitment or retention problems likely will develop (if such problems do not already exist) or will worsen;
(4) The number of vacancies an agency tried to fill, compared to the number of hires and offers made;
(5) The nature of the existing labor market;
(6) The degree to which an agency has considered and used other available pay flexibilities to alleviate staffing problems, including the superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority in 5 CFR 531.212 and recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives under 5 CFR part 575;
(7) The degree to which an agency has considered relevant non-pay solutions to staffing problems, such as conducting an aggressive recruiting program, using appropriate appointment authorities, redesigning jobs, establishing training programs, and improving working conditions;
(8) The effect of the staffing problem on the agency's mission;
(9) The level of non-Federal rates paid for comparable positions. Data on non-Federal salary rates may be supplemented, if appropriate, by data on Federal salary rates for comparable positions established under a non-GS pay system; and
(10) The level of any locality pay authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5304 and any nonforeign area cost-of-living allowance authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5941(a)(1) for the area involved.
(b) In determining the level at which to set special rates, OPM may consider the following factors:
(1) The pay levels that, in OPM's judgment, are necessary to recruit or retain an adequate number of qualified employees based on OPM's findings with respect to the factors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section;
(2) The dollar costs that will be incurred if special rates are not authorized;
(3) The level of pay for comparable positions; and
(4) The need to provide for a reasonable progression in pay from lower grade levels to higher grade levels to avoid pay alignment problems (e.g., such as might result from applying the two-step promotion rule in 5 U.S.C. 5334(b)).
(c) No one factor or combination of factors specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section requires OPM to establish or increase special rates or to set special rates at any given level.
[70 FR 31287, May 31, 2005, as amended at 76 FR 68634, Nov. 7, 2011]
§ 530.307
OPM review and adjustment of special rate schedules.
(a) OPM may review an established special rate schedule at any time to determine whether that schedule should
be increased, decreased, or discontinued, taking into account the circumstances listed in § 530.304(b) and the factors listed in § 530.306 that led to establishing the schedule. An authorized agency official may request that OPM conduct such a review of one or more special rate schedules.
(b) OPM may designate lead agencies to assist in the review of designated special rate schedules and to coordinate the collection of relevant data. Each affected agency is responsible for submitting complete supporting data upon request to OPM or the lead agency, as appropriate.
(c) OPM will adjust a special rate schedule by determining the amount of the special rate supplement to be paid on top of the current GS rate for each rate range within the schedule. OPM will determine the extent to which special rate supplements are to be adjusted (increased or decreased), if at all, and when the special rate supplements are to be adjusted. As provided in 5 U.S.C. 5305(d), special rate schedule adjustments made by OPM have the force and effect of statute.
(d)(1) For special rate schedules computed by applying a fixed-percentage supplement on top of each GS rate within a rate range, OPM may require that a change in the underlying GS rate automatically results in an adjusted special rate schedule, unless OPM determines that an adjustment in the supplement percentage is appropriate for one or more special rate schedules.
(2) For special rate schedules computed by applying a fixed-dollar supplement on top of each GS rate within a rate range, OPM may require that special rate supplements generally be adjusted to reflect the increase in GS rates, unless OPM determines that a different adjustment is appropriate for one or more special rate schedules.
(e) If OPM determines that a special rate schedule, or a rate range within a special rate schedule, is no longer needed to ensure satisfactory recruitment or retention of qualified employees, OPM may discontinue the schedule or rate range. Consistent with § 530.303(d), if all employees and positions covered by a special rate schedule or rate range are entitled to a higher rate of basic pay, the schedule or rate range (as applicable) will be automatically discontinued.
(f) OPM may change the established conditions for coverage under a special rate schedule at any time based on a reevaluation of the circumstances and factors that led to establishing the schedule. Expansion of coverage is equivalent to establishing a special rate schedule for a category of affected employees. Reduction of coverage is the equivalent of discontinuing a special rate schedule for a category of affected employees.
(g) When a special rate schedule is adjusted or discontinued, or when there is a change in a schedule's coverage criteria, the rate of pay for affected employees must be set as provided in §§ 530.321 through 530.323.
§ 530.308
Treatment of special rate as basic pay.
Except as otherwise specifically provided under other legal authority, a special rate is considered a rate of basic pay only for the following purposes:
(a) The purposes for which a locality rate is considered to be a rate of basic pay in computing other payments or benefits to the extent provided by 5 CFR 531.610, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section;
(b) Computation of foreign area post differentials under 5 U.S.C. 5925(a) and danger pay allowances under 5 U.S.C. 5928; and
(c) Application of pay administration provisions for prevailing rate employees which consider rates of basic pay under the GS pay system in setting pay (except as otherwise provided in 5 CFR part 532), subject to the requirement that, if the employee's actual special rate would not apply at the official worksite for the prevailing rate position, a special rate may be used only if it is a corresponding special rate on a special rate schedule that would cover the employee if his or her GS position of record were located at the same official worksite as the prevailing rate position, consistent with the geographic conversion rule in 5 CFR 531.205.
[70 FR 31287, May 31, 2005, as amended at 76 FR 68634, Nov. 7, 2011]
§ 530.309
Miscellaneous provisions.
(a) A special rate may be paid only for those hours for which an employee is in a pay status.
(b) A pay increase caused by an employee becoming entitled to a new or higher special rate supplement is not an equivalent increase in pay within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 5335. (See 5 CFR 531.407(c).)
(c) A special rate is included in an employee's
total remuneration,
as defined in 5 CFR 551.511(b), and
straight time rate of pay,
as defined in 5 CFR 551.512(b), for the purpose of overtime pay computations under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.
(d) Consistent with § 530.308, the reduction or termination of an employee's special rate supplement in accordance with the requirements of this subpart is not an adverse action under 5 CFR part 752, subpart D, or an action under 5 CFR 930.211.
[70 FR 31287, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66151, Nov. 7, 2008]

# Setting an Employee's Rate of Pay
§ 530.321
General.
(a) This section and §§ 530.322 and 530.323 provide conversion rules for setting an employee's pay when a special rate schedule is established, increased, decreased, or discontinued, or when an employee's coverage under an existing special rate schedule is affected by a change in coverage criteria. These conversion rules do not apply to changes in an employee's special rate entitlements based on a change in the employee's position of record or official worksite. Pay-setting rules for other personnel actions affecting special rate employees are provided in 5 CFR parts 531 and 536. For example, if an employee becomes covered by a special rate schedule as a result of a change in the employee's official worksite, the geographic conversion rule in 5 CFR 531.205 must be used to set the employee's rate(s) of basic pay in the new location before considering any other simultaneous pay action (other than a general pay adjustment).
(b) The conversion rules in §§ 530.322 and 530.323 are considered general pay adjustments for the purpose of applying 5 CFR 531.206 (dealing with the order of precedence for processing simultaneous pay actions). The rate(s) of pay resulting from these conversion rules are considered the employee's existing rate(s) of pay before processing the next simultaneous pay action in the order of precedence.
§ 530.322
Setting pay when a special rate schedule is newly established or increased.
(a)
General rule.
When an employee holds a position that becomes covered by a newly established special rate schedule (including a schedule for which coverage is expanded) or increased special rate schedule (including an increased special rate range within a schedule), the agency must set the employee's special rate at the step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) of the grade on the new special rate schedule that corresponds to the employee's existing numerical step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) as in effect immediately before the new special rate schedule takes effect, except as otherwise provided in this section. The corresponding special rate is determined by adding the applicable special rate supplement on top of the employee's GS rate, subject to the limitation that no special rate may exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule. For an employee receiving an LEO special base rate, add the applicable special rate supplement to the GS rate for the employee's grade and step, except as otherwise provided under § 530.304(d).
(b)
Employee entitled to a higher rate of basic pay.
As provided in § 530.303(d), if an employee meeting the coverage conditions for a newly established or increased special rate schedule is entitled to a higher rate of basic pay under other legal authority, the employee must be paid at that higher rate.
(c)
Employee receiving a retained rate.
When an employee is receiving a retained rate immediately before the employee's position is covered by a newly established or increased special rate schedule, the agency must determine the employee's rate of pay consistent with the requirements in 5 CFR part 536, subpart C (or 5 CFR 359.705 for a former member of the Senior Executive
Service receiving a retained rate under that section).
[70 FR 31287, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66151, Nov. 7, 2008]
§ 530.323
Setting pay when a special rate is discontinued or decreased.
(a)
General.
This section applies when a special rate applicable to a position is discontinued or decreased because of—
(1) A reduction or termination of the rates of the special rate schedule (or of rates of a rate range within a schedule); or
(2) The reduction in the scope of coverage of the special rate schedule.
(b)
Employee entitled to pay retention.
When a special rate applicable to a position is discontinued or decreased, and an employee holding the position is entitled to pay retention under 5 CFR part 536 as a result, the employee's rate of pay must be set consistent with the requirements in 5 CFR part 536, subpart C.
(c)
Employee not entitled to pay retention.
When a special rate applicable to a position is discontinued or decreased, and an employee holding the position is not entitled to pay retention under 5 CFR part 536, the employee's rate of pay is set in the highest applicable rate range at the grade and step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) that corresponds to the grade and step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) for the employee's existing special rate (as in effect immediately before the schedule change).
(d)
Employee receiving a retained rate.
When a special rate applicable to a position is discontinued or decreased, and the employee holding the position is receiving a retained rate immediately before the schedule change, the employee's rate of pay must be set consistent with the requirements in 5 CFR part 536, subpart C (or 5 CFR 359.705 for a former member of the Senior Executive Service receiving a retained rate under that section).

# Subpart B—Determining Rate of Basic Pay

# Source:

# General Provisions
§ 531.201
Purpose.
This subpart contains regulations of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) implementing 5 U.S.C 5332, 5333, and 5334, which deal with setting and adjusting rates of basic pay for General Schedule (GS) employees. These regulations are supplemented by regulations on GS within-grade increases in subpart D of this part; GS quality step increases in subpart E of this part; locality rates in subpart F of this part; special rates in 5 CFR part 530, subpart C; and grade and pay retention in 5 CFR part 536.
§ 531.202
Coverage.
This subpart covers employees who occupy positions classified and paid under the GS classification and pay system, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5102 and 5331 or other applicable laws. Law enforcement officers (LEOs) receiving LEO special base rates are covered by the GS classification and pay system, but receive higher base rates of pay in lieu of GS rates at grades GS-3 through GS-10. This subpart also covers GS employees who receive special rates under 5 U.S.C. 5305 and 5 CFR part 530, subpart C.
§ 531.203
Definitions.
In this subpart:
Agency
means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105 or an agency in the legislative branch with employees covered by this subpart. To the extent that the regulations in this subpart relate to non-GS service in the Federal Government,
agency
includes any other agency in the Federal Government.
Demotion
means a change of an employee, while continuously employed, from one GS grade to a lower GS grade, with or without a reduction in pay.
Employee
means an employee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105 who is covered by
this subpart. For the purpose of determining eligibility under the superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority in § 531.212 and applying the maximum payable rate provisions in §§ 531.216 and 531.221 (which consider rates of pay received during non-GS service in the Federal Government),
employee
also includes any employee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105 and—
(1) An individual employed by the U.S. Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission who would be considered an employee under 5 U.S.C. 2105 but for the exclusion in section 2105(e); and
(2) An individual employed by a Department of Defense or Coast Guard nonappropriated fund instrumentality (as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c)) for service covered by § 531.216 (for the purpose of applying that section and §§ 531.211 and 531.212).
Existing rate
means the rate received immediately before a pay action takes effect, after processing a general pay adjustment and any other simultaneous pay action that is higher in the order of precedence under § 531.206. For example, the
existing rate
immediately before a promotion action must reflect any geographic conversion under § 531.205 and any simultaneous within-grade increase or quality step increase.
Federal Government
means all entities of the Government of the United States, including the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission. The District of Columbia is deemed to be part of the Federal Government with respect to employees of the government of the District of Columbia (DC) who were first employed by that government before October 1, 1987. A Department of Defense or Coast Guard nonappropriated fund instrumentality (as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c)) is not considered part of the Federal Government except for the purpose of applying §§ 531.211 and 531.212 to employees covered by § 531.216 upon employment in a GS position.
General Schedule
or
GS
means the classification and pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53. It also refers to the pay schedule of GS rates established under 5 U.S.C. 5332, as adjusted under 5 U.S.C. 5303 or other law (including GS rates payable to GM employees). Law enforcement officers (LEOs) receiving LEO special base rates are covered by the GS classification and pay system but receive higher base rates of pay in lieu of GS rates at grades GS-3 through GS-10.
GM employee
means a GS employee who was formerly covered by the Performance Management and Recognition System under 5 U.S.C. chapter 54 on October 31, 1993 (and therefore became covered on November 1, 1993, by section 4 of Pub. L. 103-89, the Performance Management and Recognition System Termination Act of 1993), and who continues thereafter to occupy a position as a supervisor or management official (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(10) and (11)) in the same grade of the General Schedule (GS-13, 14, or 15) and in the same agency without a break in service of more than 3 days. (See § 531.241.) Any reference to employees, grades, positions, or rates of basic pay under the General Schedule includes GM employees.
GS rate
means a rate of basic pay within the General Schedule, excluding any LEO special base rate and additional pay of any kind such as locality payments or special rate supplements. A rate payable to a GM employee is considered a GS rate even though the rate may fall between GS step rates.
Highest applicable rate range
means the rate range applicable to a GS employee based on a given position of record and official worksite that provides the highest rates of basic pay, excluding any retained rates. For example, a rate range of special rates may exceed an applicable locality rate range. In certain circumstances, the
highest applicable rate range
may consist of two types of pay rates from different pay schedules—e.g., a range where special rates (based on a fixed dollar supplement) are higher in the lower portion of the range and locality rates are higher in the higher portion of the range.
Law enforcement officer
or
LEO
has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 550.103.
LEO special base rate
means a special base rate established for GS law enforcement officers at grades GS-3 through GS-10 under section 403 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability
Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub. L. 101-509, November 5, 1990, as amended) which is used in lieu of a GS rate.
Locality payment
means a locality-based comparability payment payable to GS employees under 5 U.S.C. 5304 and 5 CFR part 531, subpart F.
Locality rate
means a GS rate or an LEO special base rate, if applicable, plus any applicable locality payment.
Official worksite
means the official location of the employee's position of record, as determined under 5 CFR 531.605.
OPM
means the Office of Personnel Management.
Payable rate
means the highest rate of basic pay to which an employee is entitled based on the employee's position of record, official worksite, and step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) or, if applicable, a retained rate.
Pay schedule
means a set of rate ranges established for GS employees under a single authority—
i.e.
, the General Schedule, an LEO special base rate schedule (for grades GS-3 through 10), a locality rate schedule based on GS rates, a locality rate schedule based on LEO special base rates (for grades GS-3 through 10), or a special rate schedule. A pay schedule applies to or covers a defined category of employees based on established coverage conditions (e.g., official worksite, occupation). A pay schedule is considered to apply to or cover an employee who meets the established coverage conditions even when a rate under that schedule is not currently payable to the employee because of a higher pay entitlement under another pay schedule.
Position of record
means an employee's official position (defined by grade, occupational series, employing agency, LEO status, and any other condition that determines coverage under a pay schedule (other than official worksite)), as documented on the employee's most recent Notification of Personnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent) and current position description. A position to which an employee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record. For an employee whose change in official position is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee's separation before he or she is required to report for duty in the new position, the position of record in effect immediately before the position change is deemed to remain the position of record through the date of separation.
Promotion
means a GS employee's movement from one GS grade to a higher GS grade while continuously employed (including such a movement in conjunction with a transfer).
Rate of basic pay
means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by a GS employee before any deductions, including a GS rate, an LEO special base rate, a special rate, a locality rate, and a retained rate, but exclusive of additional pay of any other kind. For the purpose of applying the maximum payable rate rules in §§ 531.216 and 531.221 using a rate under a non-GS pay system as an employee's highest previous rate,
rate of basic pay
means a rate of pay under other legal authority which is equivalent to a rate of basic pay for GS employees, as described in this definition, excluding a rate under § 531.223. (See also 5 CFR 530.308, 531.610, and 536.307.)
Rate range
or
range
means a range of rates of basic pay for a grade within an established pay schedule, excluding any retained rate. A rate range may consist of GS rates, LEO special base rates, locality rates, special rates, or, for non-GS employees, similar rates under other legal authority.
Reassignment
means a change of an employee, while serving continuously in the same agency, from one position to another without promotion or demotion.
Reemployment
means employment, including reinstatement or another type of appointment, after a break in service of at least 1 full workday.
Retained rate
means a rate above the maximum rate of the rate range applicable to a GS employee which is payable under 5 CFR part 536 or, for a former member of the Senior Executive Service, under 5 CFR 359.705.
Special rate
means a rate of pay within a special rate schedule established under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or a similar rate for GS employees established under other legal authority (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 7455). The term
special rate
does not include an LEO special base rate or an adjusted rate including market pay under 38 U.S.C. 7431(c).
Special rate schedule
means a pay schedule established under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, to provide higher rates of pay for specified categories of GS positions or employees at one or more grades or levels or a similar schedule established for GS employees under other legal authority (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 7455).
Special rate supplement
means the portion of a special rate paid above an employee's GS rate. However, for a law enforcement officer receiving an LEO special base rate who is also entitled to a special rate, the special rate supplement equals the portion of the special rate paid above the officer's LEO special base rate. When a special rate schedule covers both LEO positions and other positions, the value of the special rate supplement will be less for law enforcement officers receiving an LEO special base rate (since that rate is higher than the corresponding GS rate). The payable amount of a special rate supplement is subject to the Executive Schedule level IV limitation on special rates, as provided in 5 CFR 530.304(a).
Temporary promotion
means a time-limited promotion with a not-to-exceed date or a specified term.
Transfer
means a change of an employee, without a break in service of 1 full workday, from one branch of the Federal Government (executive, legislative, or judicial) to another or from one agency to another.
Where different pay schedules apply
means, in the context of applying the geographic conversion rule, that an employee's official worksite is changed to a new location that would cause the employee to lose or gain coverage under a location-based pay schedule (
i.e.
, locality rate schedule or special rate schedule) if the employee were to remain in the same position of record.
Within-grade increase
has the meaning given that term in § 531.403.
[70 FR 31291, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66152, Nov. 7, 2008; 73 FR 76847, Dec. 18, 2008]
§ 531.204
Entitlement to other rates of pay.
(a) A law enforcement officer is entitled to LEO special base rates in lieu of GS rates at grades GS-3 through GS-10. A law enforcement officer is entitled to the LEO special base rate that corresponds to his or her grade and step. If an employee loses LEO status, the employee is entitled to the GS rate for his or her grade and step unless a higher rate is set under the maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221 or under the pay retention rules in 5 CFR part 536, as applicable. LEO special base rates are used in computing locality rates, as provided in subpart F of this part. A law enforcement officer may be entitled to a special rate that is computed using the underlying GS rate for the LEO's grade and step.
(b) When an employee's GS rate or LEO special base rate is determined under the rules of this subpart, the agency must determine any other rate of basic pay to which the employee is entitled, including a locality rate under subpart F of this part and a special rate under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or other legal authority (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 7455). The employee is entitled to the highest applicable rate of basic pay as his or her payable rate. When an employee's special rate is surpassed by a higher locality rate, his or her entitlement to a special rate is terminated, as provided in § 530.303(d).
(c) When application of the rules in this subpart results in setting an employee's payable rate in the highest applicable pay schedule (e.g., a locality rate schedule or a special rate schedule), the agency must determine the employee's underlying GS rate or LEO special base rate, as applicable, based on that payable rate (
i.e.
, by finding the corresponding underlying rate with the same grade and step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) as the payable rate).
[70 FR 31291, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66152, Nov. 7, 2008]
§ 531.205
Converting pay upon change in location of employee's official worksite.
When an employee's official worksite is changed to a new location where different pay schedules apply, the agency
must convert the employee's rate(s) of basic pay to the applicable pay schedule(s) in the new location before processing any simultaneous pay action (other than a general pay adjustment, as provided in § 531.206). The agency must first set the employee's rate(s) of basic pay in the applicable pay schedule(s) in the new location based on his or her position of record (including grade) and step (or a GM employee's GS rate) immediately before the change in the employee's official worksite. The resulting rate must be used as the existing rate in processing the next simultaneous pay action in the order of precedence, using the applicable pay schedules in the new location. In conjunction with any simultaneous pay actions, the employee's rate(s) of basic pay will then be set based on the employee's new position of record and new official worksite.
[70 FR 31291, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66152, Nov. 7, 2008]
§ 531.206
Order of processing simultaneous pay actions.
When multiple pay actions with the same effective date affect an employee's rate of basic pay, the actions will be processed in the following order:
(a) Process general pay adjustments before any individual pay action that takes effect at the same time. General pay adjustments include an annual adjustment in the General Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5303; an adjustment in LEO special base rates; an adjustment of a locality pay percentage under subpart F of this part; the establishment or adjustment of a special rate schedule under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or similar legal authority (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 7455); and an adjustment of a retained rate under 5 CFR 359.705(d)(1) and 536.305(a)(1) based on the establishment or adjustment of a pay schedule.
(b) Convert the employee's rate(s) of pay to reflect any change in the location of the employee's official worksite, as prescribed in § 531.205 (or similar geographic conversion provision).
(c) Process any within-grade increase or quality step increase to which the employee is entitled.
(d) Process any promotion action using the rates of pay and rate ranges in the sequence prescribed in § 531.214.
(e) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section or other regulation, process individual pay actions that take effect at the same time in the order that gives the employee the maximum benefit.
§ 531.207
Applying annual pay adjustments.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, on the effective date of a GS pay adjustment under 5 U.S.C. 5303 or similar authority, an agency initially must set the GS rate of a GS employee at the new rate of the adjusted General Schedule corresponding to the employee's grade and step in effect immediately before the effective date of the pay adjustment. Any simultaneous pay actions must be processed after the pay adjustment, as provided in § 531.206.
(b) For employees receiving a retained rate immediately before the effective date of a GS annual pay adjustment, the agency must adjust the employee's rate of basic pay under the rules in 5 CFR 536.305 (or under 5 CFR 359.705 for former members of the Senior Executive Service receiving a retained rate under that section).
(c) For GM employees, the agency must follow the rules in § 531.244.

# Setting Pay When Appointment or Position Changes
§ 531.211
Setting pay for a newly appointed employee.
(a)
First appointment.
An agency must set the payable rate of basic pay for an employee receiving his or her first appointment (regardless of tenure) as a civilian employee of the Federal Government at the minimum rate of the highest applicable rate range for the employee's position of record, except as provided in § 531.212.
(b)
Reemployment.
For an employee who has previous civilian service in the Federal Government, an agency must set the payable rate of basic pay upon reemployment at the minimum rate of the highest applicable rate range for the employee's position of record unless—
(1) The employee meets the conditions in § 531.212 and an agency determines it is appropriate to set pay under that section; or
(2) The employee is eligible for a higher payable rate under the maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221 and the agency chooses to apply that rule.
§ 531.212
Superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority.
(a)
Agency authority.
(1) An agency may use the superior qualifications or special needs pay-setting authority in 5 U.S.C. 5333 to set the payable rate of basic pay for an employee above the minimum rate of the highest applicable rate range for the employee's position of record. The superior qualifications or special needs pay-setting authority may be used for—
(i) A first appointment (regardless of tenure) as a civilian employee of the Federal Government; or
(ii) A reappointment that is considered a new appointment under 5 U.S.C. 5333 because it meets the conditions prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) and (3) of this section.
(2) An agency may use the superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority for a reappointment only when the employee has had a break in service of at least 90 days from the last period of civilian employment with the Federal Government, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, an agency may use the superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority for a reappointment without requiring a 90-day break in service if the candidate's civilian employment with the Federal Government during the 90-day period immediately preceding the appointment was limited to one or more of the following:
(i) A time-limited appointment in the competitive or excepted service;
(ii) A non-permanent appointment in the competitive or excepted service;
(iii) Employment with the government of the District of Columbia (DC) when the candidate was first appointed by the DC government on or after October 1, 1987;
(iv) An appointment as an expert or consultant under 5 U.S.C. 3109 and 5 CFR part 304;
(v) Employment under a provisional appointment designated under 5 CFR 316.403;
(vi) Employment under an Internship Program appointment under § 213.3402(a) of this chapter ; or
(vii) Employment as a Senior Executive Service limited term appointee or limited emergency appointee (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(5) and (a)(6), respectively).
(4) Service as an employee of a nonappropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI) of the Department of Defense or Coast Guard is not considered employment by the Federal Government under this section except for employees covered by § 531.216 upon appointment or reappointment (
i.e.
, employees who move from NAFI position to GS position with a break in service of 3 days or less and without a change in agency). Employees covered by § 531.216 upon appointment or reappointment to a GS position are not eligible to have pay set under the superior qualifications or special needs authority, since their NAFI employment is considered employment by the Federal Government. Otherwise, NAFI employment does not block application of this section.
(5) An agency may not apply an exception in paragraph (a)(3) of this section if the candidate's civilian employment with the Federal Government during the 90-day period immediately preceding the appointment was in one or more of the following types of positions:
(i) A position to which an individual is appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate;
(ii) A position in the Senior Executive Service as a noncareer appointee (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(7));
(iii) A position excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character;
(iv) A position to which an individual is appointed by the President without the advice and consent of the Senate;
(v) A position designated as the head of an agency, including an agency headed by a collegial body composed of two or more individual members;
(vi) A position in which the employee is expected to receive an appointment as the head of an agency; or
(vii) A position to which an individual is appointed as a Senior Executive Service limited term appointee or limited emergency appointee (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(5) and (a)(6), respectively) when the appointment must be cleared through the White House Office of Presidential Personnel.
(b)
Superior qualifications or special needs determination.
An agency may set the payable rate of basic pay of a newly appointed employee above the minimum rate of the grade under this section if the candidate meets one of the following criteria:
(1) The candidate has superior qualifications. An agency may determine that a candidate has superior qualifications based on the level, type, or quality of the candidate's skills or competencies demonstrated or obtained through experience and/or education, the quality of the candidate's accomplishments compared to others in the field, or other factors that support a superior qualifications determination. The candidate's skills, competencies, experience, education, and/or accomplishments must be relevant to the requirements of the position to be filled. These qualities must be significantly higher than that needed to be minimally required for the position and/or be of a more specialized quality compared to other candidates; or
(2) The candidate fills a special agency need. An agency may determine that a candidate fills a special agency need if the type, level, or quality of skills and competencies or other qualities and experiences possessed by the candidate are relevant to the requirements of the position and are essential to accomplishing an important agency mission, goal, or program activity. A candidate also may meet the special needs criteria by meeting agency workforce needs, as documented in the agency's strategic human capital plan.
(c)
Pay rate determination.
To determine the step at which to set an employee's payable rate of basic pay using the superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority, an agency must consider:
(1) The step at which pay has been set for employees who had similar qualifications (based on the level, type, or quality of the candidate's skills or competencies or other qualities and experiences) and who have been newly appointed to positions that are similar to the candidate's position (based on the position's occupational series, grade level, organization, geographic location, or other job-relevant factors), if applicable; and
(2) One or more of the following factors, as applicable in the case at hand:
(i) The level, type, or quality of the candidate's skills or competencies;
(ii) Significant disparities between Federal and non-Federal salaries for the skills and competencies required in the position to be filled;
(iii) Existing labor market conditions and employment trends, including the availability and quality of candidates for the same or similar positions;
(iv) The success of recent efforts to recruit candidates for the same or similar positions;
(v) Recent turnover in the same or similar positions;
(vi) The importance/criticality of the position to be filled and the effect on the agency if it is not filled or if there is a delay in filling it;
(vii) The desirability of the geographic location, duties, and/or work environment associated with the position;
(viii) Agency workforce needs, as documented in the agency's strategic human capital plan; or
(ix) Other relevant factors, except that an agency may not consider the candidate's salary history (
i.e.,
existing salary or prior salary) or a salary from a competing job offer.
(d)
Consideration of recruitment incentive.
In determining whether to use the superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority and the level at which the employee's payable rate of basic pay should be set, an agency must consider the possibility of authorizing a recruitment incentive under 5 CFR part 575, subpart A.
(e)
Approval and documentation requirements.
(1) An agency must approve each determination to use the superior qualifications and special needs pay-
setting authority prior to the candidate entering on duty. Each determination must be made in writing and reviewed and approved by an official of the agency who is at least one level higher than the employee's supervisor, unless there is no official at a higher level in the agency.
(2) An agency must document all of the following for each determination to use the superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority sufficient to allow reconstruction of the action taken in each case:
(i) The superior qualifications of the candidate under paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the special agency need for the candidate's services under paragraph (b)(2) of this section which justifies a higher than minimum rate;
(ii) An explanation of the factors and supporting documentation under paragraph (c) of this section which were used to justify the rate at which the employee's pay is set. The written documentation must explain how the factors directly relate to the rate approved; and
(iii) The reasons for authorizing a higher than minimum rate instead of or in addition to a recruitment incentive under 5 CFR part 575, subpart A.
(f)
Ensuring compliance.
An agency must establish appropriate internal guidelines and evaluation procedures to ensure compliance with the law, this section of OPM regulations, and agency policies.
[70 FR 31291, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66152, Nov. 7, 2008; 77 FR 28222, May 11, 2012; 78 FR 49362, Aug. 14, 2013; 89 FR 5754, Jan. 30, 2024]
§ 531.213
Setting pay upon change in position without a change in grade.
For an employee who is moved laterally (by transfer, reassignment, change in type of appointment, change in official worksite, or other change in position) from one GS position to a different GS position without a change in grade or a break in service, the agency must determine the employee's payable rate of basic pay and any underlying rate(s)s of basic pay based on the employee's new position of record, new official worksite, and the step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) in effect before the position change. If an employee is eligible to receive a higher rate under the maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221, the agency may choose to apply that rule. If an employee is entitled to pay retention, the agency must apply the rules in 5 CFR part 536.
[70 FR 31291, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66152, Nov. 7, 2008]
§ 531.214
Setting pay upon promotion.
(a)
General.
An agency must set an employee's payable rate of basic pay upon promotion following the rules in this section, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 5334(b). The promotion rule in 5 U.S.C. 5334(b) and the implementing rules in this section apply only to a GS employee who is promoted from one GS grade to a higher GS grade. Consistent with § 531.206, any general pay adjustment that takes effect on the same day as a promotion action must be processed before applying the rules in this section.
(b)
Geographic conversion.
When an employee's official worksite is changed to a new location where different pay schedules apply, the agency must convert the employee to the applicable pay schedule(s) and rate(s) of basic pay for the new official worksite based on the employee's position of record before promotion as provided in § 531.205 before processing a simultaneous promotion action.
(c)
Simultaneous within-grade increase.
When an employee is entitled to a within-grade increase or a quality step increase that is effective at the same time as a promotion, the agency must process that increase before processing the promotion action.
(d)
Promotion rule
—(1)
General.
An agency must determine an employee's payable rate of basic pay upon promotion using the standard method in paragraph (d)(3) of this section or the alternate method in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, subject to the special rule in paragraph (d)(5) of this section for employees receiving a retained rate before promotion. A determination regarding whether the alternate method is used in place of the standard method depends on the pay schedules that apply to an employee before and after promotion, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In this paragraph
(d), references to an employee's rate or range “before promotion” mean the rate or range before promotion but after any geographic conversion required by paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Determining applicable method.
The following rules govern determinations regarding which promotion method to use:
(i) Apply the standard method exclusively if the employee is covered by the same pay schedules before and after promotion. For example, an employee may be covered by the General Schedule and the same locality rate schedule before and after promotion.
(ii) Apply the alternate method if the employee is covered by different pay schedules before and after promotion and if the alternate method will produce a higher payable rate upon promotion than the standard method. For example, an employee may be covered after promotion by a special rate schedule that did not apply to him or her before promotion, and the alternate method will produce a higher rate.
(iii) Apply the standard method in all other circumstances, except that an agency may, at its sole and exclusive discretion, apply the alternate method for an employee covered by different pay schedules before and after promotion even though the method produces a lesser payable rate than the standard method, but only under the following conditions:
(A) The agency determines it would be inappropriate to use the standard method based on a finding that the higher pay for the position before promotion is not sufficiently related to the knowledge and skills required for the position after promotion; and
(B) The agency informs the employee of the determination to use the alternate method before the effective date of the promotion.
(3)
Standard method.
(i) The standard method of applying the promotion rule is presented in the following table:
Promotion Rule—Standard Method
Step A
If applicable, apply the geographic conversion rule in § 531.205 to determine the employee's rate(s) and range(s) of basic pay based on the employee's position of record before promotion and the new official worksite, as required by paragraph (b) of this section. Also, if applicable, provide any simultaneous within-grade increase or quality step increase, as required by paragraph (c) of this section. Use the resulting rate(s) of basic pay as the existing rate(s) in effect immediately before promotion in applying steps B and C.
Step B
Identify the employee's existing GS rate (or LEO special base rate) in the grade before promotion, and increase that rate by two GS within-grade increases for that grade.
Step C
Determine the payable (highest) rate of basic pay for the step or rate determined in step B by applying any locality payment or special rate supplement applicable to the given grade, based on the employee's position of record before promotion and official worksite after promotion. (If the rate determined in step B is above the range maximum, use the same locality payment or special rate supplement that applies to rates within the rate range.)
Step D
Identify the highest applicable rate range for the employee's position of record after promotion and find the lowest step rate in that range that equals or exceeds the rate determined in step C. This is the employee's payable rate of basic pay upon promotion. (If the rate identified in step C exceeds the maximum of the rate range identified in this step, the employee's payable rate is that maximum rate, or, if the employee's existing rate is higher than that maximum rate, a retained rate under 5 CFR part 536 equal to that existing rate.)
(ii) Example of standard method: A GS-11, step 5, employee in Los Angeles is promoted to a GS-12 position in Kansas City. In Kansas City, a special rate schedule would apply to the employee's GS-11 position, but at GS-12 no special rate range applies; instead, just a locality rate range applies. Thus, different pay schedules apply to the employee in Kansas City before and after promotion. The agency determines that the standard method produces a higher rate than the alternate method because the employee is covered by a special rate schedule before promotion but not after promotion, The agency also determines it will not invoke the exception provision under paragraph (d)(2)(iii). The agency applies the standard method as follows:
Step A
Apply the geographic conversion rule to determine the rates of basic pay for the GS-11, step 5, position in Kansas City. The pay schedules applicable to the employee in Kansas City are the General Schedule, the locality rate schedule applicable in Kansas City, and the special rate schedule applicable to the employee's position in Kansas City.
Step B
Using the underlying General Schedule, increase the GS-11, step 5, rate by two within-grade increases, which produces the GS-11, step 7, rate.
Step C
The payable (highest) rate of basic pay for GS-11, step 7, is the corresponding GS-11, step 7, special rate that would be applicable to the GS-11 position in Kansas City.
Step D
The highest applicable rate range for the GS-12 position after promotion is the GS-12 locality rate range under the Kansas City locality rate schedule. Find the lowest step rate in that range that equals or exceeds the GS-11, step 7, special rate from step C. That step rate is the payable rate of basic pay upon promotion.
(4)
Alternate method.
(i) The alternate method of applying the promotion rule, which involves using pay schedules applicable before promotion and then converting pay to a different schedule applicable after promotion, is presented in the following table:
Promotion Rule—Alternate Method
Steps A, B, C
Same as standard method in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
Step D
Identify the highest applicable rate range for the employee's grade after promotion based on consideration of any pay schedule that applied to the employee's position of record
before
promotion (after any geographic conversion). (Do not consider pay schedules that apply only to the employee's new position of record after promotion. For example, if a particular special rate schedule applies only to an employee's position of record after promotion, disregard that schedule in applying this step.) Find the lowest step in the highest applicable rate range that equals or exceeds the rate identified in step C. (If the rate identified in step C exceeds the maximum of the rate range identified in this step, the employee's payable rate is that maximum rate, or, if the employee's existing rate is higher than that maximum rate, a retained rate under 5 CFR part 536 equal to that existing rate.)
Step E
Convert the lowest step rate identified in step D to a corresponding step rate (same step) in the highest applicable rate range for the employee's new position of record after promotion. This is the employee's alternate payable rate of basic pay upon promotion. (If the rate derived under step D was a retained rate, determine the alternate payable rate of basic pay as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.)
Step F
If the alternate payable rate identified in step E exceeds the payable rate resulting from the standard method in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the employee is entitled to the alternate rate upon promotion. Otherwise, the employee is entitled to the payable rate derived under the standard method, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.
(ii) In applying step E of the table in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, if the rate derived under step D was a retained rate, compare the retained rate to the highest applicable rate range identified in step E. If the retained rate exceeds the maximum of that rate range, the retained rate continues and is the employee's alternate payable rate upon promotion. If the retained rate is below the rate range maximum, the employee's alternate payable rate upon promotion is the maximum rate of the range (step 10).
(iii) Example of alternate method: A GS-7, step 7, employee in Atlanta is promoted to a GS-9 position in Washington, DC. The promotion involves not only a change in grade but also a change in the employee's occupational series. In Washington, DC, no special rate schedule would apply to a GS-7 or GS-9 position in the old occupational series, but a special rate schedule does apply to the GS-9 position in the new occupational series. Thus, different pay schedules apply before and after promotion, and the alternate method would result in a higher rate than the standard method. As provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the agency must apply the alternate method and compare the result to the result derived under the standard method, as follows:
Step A
Apply the geographic conversion rule in § 531.205 to determine the rates of basic pay for the GS-7, step 7, position in Washington, DC. Based on the GS-7 position before promotion (including the old occupational series), the pay schedules applicable to the employee in Washington, DC, would be the General Schedule and the locality rate schedule applicable in Washington, DC.
Step B
Using the underlying General Schedule, increase the GS-7, step 7, rate by two within-grade increases, which produces the GS-7, step 9, rate.
Step C
The payable (highest) rate of basic pay for GS-7, step 9, is the corresponding GS-7, step 9, locality rate in Washington, DC.
Step D
If the employee were promoted to a GS-9 position in the old occupational series, the highest applicable rate range for that GS-9 position after promotion would be the GS-9 locality rate range in Washington, DC. The GS-9, step 3, locality rate is the lowest step rate in that range that equals or exceeds the GS-7, step 9, locality rate from step C.
Step E
Convert the GS-9, step 3, locality rate to the higher GS-9, step 3, special rate that applies to the employee's position after promotion (including the new occupational series). That GS-9, step 3, special rate is the payable rate of basic pay upon promotion.
Step F
Assume that the standard method would have compared the GS-7, step 9, locality rate directly to the higher GS-9 range of special rates and produced a rate of GS-9, step 1. Since the rate produced by the alternate method (GS-9, step 3) is greater than the rate produced by the standard method, the result of the alternate method is used.
(5)
If employee was receiving a retained rate before promotion.
(i) If an employee's existing payable rate of basic pay before promotion is a retained rate, apply the applicable promotion methods in paragraphs (d)(3) or (d)(4) of this section as if the employee were receiving the maximum rate of the employee's grade before promotion.
(ii) If the payable rate of basic pay after promotion determined under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section is greater than the employee's existing retained rate, the employee is entitled to that payable rate.
(iii) If the existing retained rate is greater than the rate determined under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, the retained rate must be compared to the highest applicable rate range for the position after promotion, as provided in 5 CFR 536.304. The employee is entitled to the lowest step rate in the range that equals or exceeds the retained rate or, if the retained rate exceeds the range maximum, to the retained rate.
(6)
If employee is promoted from GS-1 or GS-2.
In applying the promotion rule to an employee who is promoted from step 9 or 10 of grade GS-1 or GS-2, the value of two within-grade increases is determined by doubling the within-grade increase between step 9 and 10 for the applicable grade.
(e)
Temporary promotions.
Pay is set for an employee receiving a temporary promotion on the same basis as a permanent promotion. Upon expiration or termination of the temporary promotion, pay is set as provided in § 531.215(c). If a temporary promotion is made permanent immediately after the temporary promotion ends, the agency may not return the employee to the lower grade; instead, the agency must convert the employee's temporary promotion to a permanent promotion without a change in pay.
(f)
Corrections of demotions.
The promotion rule in this section may not be used in correcting an erroneous demotion. (See § 531.215(e).)
[70 FR 31291, May 31, 2005, as amended at 70 FR 74995, Dec. 19, 2005]
§ 531.215
Setting pay upon demotion.
(a)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, an employee who is demoted is entitled to the minimum payable rate of basic pay for the lower grade unless the agency sets the employee's pay at a higher rate under—
(1) The grade and pay retention rules in 5 CFR part 536, as applicable; or
(2) The maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221, as applicable.
(b)
Geographic conversion.
If the employee's official worksite after demotion is in a different geographic location where different pay schedules apply, the agency must first convert the employee's payable rate of pay as required by § 531.205 before setting the demoted employee's pay using the grade and pay retention rules in 5 CFR part 536 or the maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221.
(c)
Expiration or termination of a temporary promotion.
(1) When an employee is returned to the lower grade from which promoted on expiration or termination of a temporary promotion, the agency must set the employee's payable rate of basic pay in the lower grade as if he or she had not been temporarily promoted, unless the agency sets pay at a higher rate under the maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221. As provided in subpart D of this part, time during the temporary promotion may be creditable service towards GS within-grade increases in the lower grade.
(2) If a temporary promotion is made permanent immediately after the temporary promotion ends, the agency may not return the employee to the lower grade. (See § 531.214(e).)
(d)
Demotion upon failure to complete a supervisory probationary period.
When an employee promoted to a supervisory or managerial position does not satisfactorily complete a probationary period established under 5 U.S.C. 3321(a)(2) and is returned to a position at the lower grade held before the promotion, the agency must set the employee's payable rate of basic pay upon return to the lower grade as if the employee had not been promoted to the supervisory or managerial position, unless the agency sets pay at a higher rate under the maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221. As provided in subpart D of this part, time served following the promotion may be creditable service towards GS within-grade increases in the lower grade. However, nothing in this paragraph prohibits an agency from taking action against an employee serving under a probationary period under 5 U.S.C. 3321(a)(2) for cause unrelated to supervisory or managerial performance and setting pay in accordance with such action.
(e)
Correcting an erroneous demotion.
When a demotion is determined to be erroneous and is canceled, the agency must set the employee's rate of basic pay as if the employee had not been demoted. The action is a correction of the original demotion action and may not be treated as a promotion under § 531.214. For example, when a demotion based on a reclassification of the employee's position is found to be erroneous and is corrected retroactively under 5 CFR 511.703, the corrective action is cancellation of the original demotion.
[70 FR 31291, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66152, Nov. 7, 2008]
§ 531.216
Setting pay when an employee moves from a Department of Defense or Coast Guard nonappropriated fund instrumentality.
(a)
General.
This section governs the setting of pay for an employee who moves to a GS position in the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard from a position in a nonappropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI) (as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c)) of the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively, without a break in service of more than 3 days. If an employee moves from a NAFI position to a GS position with a break of more than 3 days or moves from a NAFI position in the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard to a GS position outside of the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively, the employee has no special conversion rights and this section does not apply.
(b)
NAFI highest previous rate.
For the purpose of this section, the term “NAFI highest previous rate” means the highest rate of basic pay received by an employee during service in a NAFI position, as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c).
(c)
Voluntary move.
(1) For a Department of Defense or Coast Guard employee who moves voluntarily, without a break in service of more than 3 days, from a NAFI position in the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard to a GS position in the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively, the agency may set the employee's initial payable rate of basic pay at the lowest step rate in the highest applicable rate range currently in effect for the employee's GS position of record and official worksite which equals or exceeds the employee's NAFI highest previous rate of pay, or any lower step rate, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section. The employee's initial payable rate of basic pay may not exceed the maximum step rate (step 10).
(2) If the highest applicable rate range would be different if the official worksite for the employee's position of record were located at the place where the employee was stationed while earning the NAFI highest previous rate, the agency must determine the employee's maximum payable rate of basic pay as follows:
(i) Compare the NAFI highest previous rate to the highest applicable rate range currently in effect in the location where the employee was stationed while earning that rate. The highest applicable rate range is determined based on the pay schedules that would be applicable to the employee's current GS position of record if the employee were stationed in that location. Identify the lowest step rate in the highest applicable rate range that was equal to or exceeded the NAFI highest
previous rate. If the NAFI highest previous rate is less than the range minimum, identify the minimum step rate (step 1). If the NAFI highest previous rate exceeds the range maximum, identify the maximum step rate (step 10).
(ii) Identify the step rate in the highest applicable rate range for the employee's current official worksite and position of record that corresponds to the step rate derived under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. That corresponding rate is the maximum payable rate at which the agency may set the employee's pay under this section, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The agency may set the employee's rate of basic pay at any step rate that does not exceed that maximum payable rate.
(3) An agency may choose to apply the maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221 based on a non-NAFI rate of basic pay if that rule provides a higher rate than provided by paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
(d)
Involuntary move.
(1) For a Department of Defense or Coast Guard employee who is moved involuntarily (as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section), without a break in service of more than 3 days, from a NAFI position in the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard to a GS position with substantially the same duties in the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively, the employee is entitled to an initial payable rate of basic pay at the lowest step rate of the grade that is equal to or greater than the employee's rate of basic pay in the NAFI position immediately before the move. If the employee's former NAFI rate exceeds the range maximum, identify the maximum step rate (step 10).
(2) For an employee covered by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the agency may set the initial payable rate of basic pay at any of the following rates, unless the employee is entitled to receive a higher rate of basic pay under paragraph (d)(1) of this section:
(i) The lowest step rate within the highest applicable rate range for the employee's GS position of record and official worksite that equals or exceeds the employee's NAFI highest previous rate, or any lower step rate (consistent with the method prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section);
(ii) A rate determined under the maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221 (using non-NAFI rates of basic pay); or
(iii) A rate determined under the authority to grant pay retention in 5 CFR 536.302(a).
(3) For the purpose of this paragraph (d), “moved involuntarily” means the movement of the incumbent of an NAFI position in the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard with the position when it is moved to the civil service employment system of the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively.
[70 FR 31291, May 31, 2005, as amended at 74 FR 23938, May 22, 2009]
§ 531.217
Special conversion rules for certain non-GS employees.
When an employee moves (without a break in service) to a GS position from a non-GS system under an authority in 5 U.S.C. chapters 47, 95, or similar provision of law, and that authority provides that an employee will be converted to GS-equivalent rates immediately before leaving the non-GS system, the employee is considered a GS employee in applying the provisions of this subpart.

# Using a Highest Previous Rate Under the Maximum Payable Rate Rule
§ 531.221
Maximum payable rate rule.
(a)
General.
(1) An agency may apply the maximum payable rate rule as described in this section to determine an employee's payable rate of basic pay under the GS pay system at a rate higher than the otherwise applicable rate upon reemployment, transfer, reassignment, promotion, demotion, change in type of appointment, termination of a critical position pay authority under 5 CFR part 535, movement from a non-GS pay system, or termination of grade or pay retention under 5 CFR part 536. (
Note:
Special rules for GM employees are provided in § 531.247.) A payable rate set under this section must take effect on the effective date of the action involved. This section may not be used to set an employee's rate of basic pay retroactively unless a retroactive action is required
to comply with a nondiscretionary agency policy.
(2) At its discretion, an agency may set an employee's rate(s) of basic pay at the maximum rate identified under this section or at a lower rate. However, the employee's rate may not be lower than the rate to which he or she is entitled under any other applicable pay-setting rule.
(3) In applying this section, an agency must use applicable annual rates of pay or, if a rate under a non-GS system is an hourly rate, convert the hourly rate to an annual rate.
(4) In applying this section, an agency must treat a critical position pay rate under 5 CFR part 535 as if it were a rate under a non-GS pay system, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(5) In applying this section, an agency must treat an adjusted GS rate that includes market pay under 38 U.S.C. 7431(c) as if it were a rate under a non-GS pay system, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(6) Before setting pay under this section, an agency must establish a policy on its use of the maximum payable rate rule that includes—
(i) Designation of officials with the authority to approve and set pay under this section;
(ii) Any situations in which the agency must use the authority;
(iii) Any situations in which the agency may exercise its discretion in using the authority;
(iv) Consideration of the step at which pay has been set for other employees performing similar work in the organization (based on the position's occupational series, grade level, types of duties, or other job-relevant factors) and any other factors the designated official(s) may or must consider in determining the step at which to set the employee's pay between the employee's entitlement under any other applicable pay-setting rule and the employee's maximum payable rate; and
(v) Documentation and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to allow reconstruction of the action.
(b)
When highest previous rate is based on a GS rate or LEO special base rate.
When an employee's highest previous rate (as determined under § 531.222) is based on a GS rate or an LEO special base rate paid under the GS pay system, an agency must determine the maximum payable rate of basic pay that may be paid to the employee as follows:
(1) Compare the employee's highest previous rate with the GS rates for the grade in which pay is currently being set. For this comparison, use the schedule of GS rates in effect at the time the highest previous rate was earned. In applying this paragraph to an employee who was a law enforcement officer receiving an LEO special base rate when the highest previous rate was earned, compare the highest previous rate to the applicable LEO special base rates in lieu of GS rates if the grade in which pay is currently being set is one of the grades from GS-3 through GS-10.
(2) Identify the lowest step in the grade at which the GS rate (or LEO special base rate, if applicable) was equal to or greater than the employee's highest previous rate. If the employee's highest previous rate was greater than the maximum GS rate (or LEO special base rate, if applicable) for the grade, identify the step 10 rate (
i.e.
, maximum rate of the grade).
(3) Identify the rate on the currently applicable range of GS rates or LEO special base rates for the employee's current position of record and grade that corresponds to the step identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This rate is the maximum payable GS rate or LEO special base rate the agency may pay the employee under this section.
(4) After setting the employee's GS or LEO special base rate within the rate range for the grade (not to exceed the maximum payable rate identified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section), the agency must determine the employee's payable rate of basic pay based on the employee's GS or LEO special base rate.
(c)
When highest previous rate is based on a GS employee's special rate.
When a GS employee is reassigned under the conditions described in § 531.222(c), the employee's former special rate in effect immediately before the reassignment may be used as the employee's highest previous rate. If the employee's former
special rate schedule is being adjusted on the effective date of the employee's reassignment, the agency must determine what the employee's special rate would have been on that adjusted schedule (before any other simultaneous action) and treat the resulting special rate as the employee's former special rate in applying paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section. The agency must apply the maximum payable rate rule as follows:
(1) When the employee is assigned to an official worksite within the geographic boundaries of a formerly applicable special rate schedule, compare the former special rate to the rates of basic pay in the highest applicable rate range for the employee's current position of record and current official worksite. Identify the lowest step rate in that range that equals or exceeds the former special rate (or the maximum step rate, if the former special rate exceeds the range maximum). That step rate is the employee's maximum payable rate of basic pay.
(2) When the employee is assigned to an official worksite outside the geographic boundaries of the formerly applicable special rate schedule, determine the maximum payable rate as follows:
(i) Convert the former special rate to a corresponding rate (same step) in the current highest applicable rate range for the new official worksite based on the employee's position of record immediately before the reassignment.
(ii) If the rate resulting from the geographic conversion under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is a special rate, that converted special rate is deemed to be the employee's former special rate and highest previous rate in applying paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. If the resulting rate is not a special rate, this paragraph (c) may not be used to determine the employee's maximum payable rate. Instead, paragraph (b) of this section must be used.
(iii) Compare the employee's highest previous rate (
i.e.
, the former special rate after the geographic conversion) with the rates on the current highest applicable rate range for the new official worksite based on the employee's position of record after the reassignment. Identify the lowest step rate in that range that equals or exceeds the highest previous rate (or the maximum step rate, if the highest previous rate exceeds the range maximum). That step rate is the employee's maximum payable rate of basic pay.
(3) After setting the employee's rate of basic pay in the highest applicable rate range (not to exceed the maximum payable rate), the agency must determine any underlying rate of basic pay to which the employee is entitled based on the employee's step rate.
(d)
When highest previous rate is based on a rate under a non-GS pay system.
When an employee's highest previous rate (as provided in § 531.222) is based on a rate of basic pay in a non-GS pay system, the agency must determine the maximum payable rate of basic pay that may be paid to the employee in his or her current GS position of record as follows:
(1) Compare the highest previous rate to the highest applicable rate range in effect at the time and place where the highest previous rate was earned. The highest applicable rate range is determined as if the employee held the current GS position of record (including grade in which pay is being set) at that time and place. Identify the lowest step rate in that range that was equal to or higher than the highest previous rate (or the maximum step rate if the highest previous rate exceeded the range maximum).
(2) Convert the step rate identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to a corresponding rate (same step) in the current highest applicable rate range for the employee's current GS position of record and official worksite. That step rate is the employee's maximum payable rate of basic pay.
(3) After setting the employee's rate of basic pay in the current highest applicable rate range (not to exceed the maximum payable rate), the agency must determine any underlying rate of basic pay to which the employee is entitled at the determined step rate.
[70 FR 31291, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66152, Nov. 7, 2008; 89 FR 5755, Jan. 30, 2024]
§ 531.222
Rates of basic pay that may be used as the highest previous rate.
(a)(1) Subject to the conditions in this section and § 531.223, the highest previous rate used in applying § 531.221 is—
(i) The highest rate of basic pay previously received by an individual while employed in a civilian position in any part of the Federal Government (including service with the government of the District of Columbia for employees first employed by that government before October 1, 1987), without regard to whether the position was in the GS pay system; or
(ii) The highest rate of basic pay in effect when a GS employee held his or her highest GS grade and highest step within that grade.
(2) The highest previous rate must be a rate of basic pay received by an employee while serving on a regular tour of duty—
(i) Under an appointment not limited to 90 days or less; or
(ii) For a continuous period of not less than 90 days under one or more appointments without a break in service.
(b) For periods of service as a GS employee, the highest previous rate may not be a special rate, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. If the highest previous rate is a locality rate, the underlying GS rate or an LEO special base rate associated with that locality rate must be used as the highest previous rate in applying § 531.221(b).
(c) An agency may use a GS employee's special rate established under 5 U.S.C. 5305 and 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or 38 U.S.C. 7455 as the highest previous rate when all of the following conditions apply:
(1) The employee is reassigned to another position in the same agency at the same grade level;
(2) The special rate is the employee's rate of basic pay immediately before the reassignment; and
(3) An authorized agency official finds that the need for the services of the employee, and the employee's contribution to the program of the agency, will be greater in the position to which reassigned. An agency must make such determinations on a case-by-case basis. In each case, the agency must document the determination to use the special rate as an employee's highest previous rate in writing.
(d) When an agency is barred from using a special rate established under 5 U.S.C. 5305 and 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or 38 U.S.C. 7455 as an employee's highest previous rate under § 531.223(g), the agency must consider a special rate employee's underlying GS rate (or LEO special base rate, if applicable) in determining the employee's highest previous rate for the purpose of applying paragraph (b) of this section.
[70 FR 31291, May 31, 2005, as amended at 70 FR 74995, Dec. 19, 2005]
§ 531.223
Rates of basic pay that may not be used as the highest previous rate.
The highest previous rate may not be based on the following:
(a) A rate received under an appointment as an expert or consultant under 5 U.S.C. 3109;
(b) A rate received in a position to which the employee was temporarily promoted for less than 1 year, except upon permanent placement in a position at the same or higher grade;
(c) A rate received in a position from which the employee was reassigned or reduced in grade for failure to satisfactorily complete a probationary period as a supervisor or manager;
(d) A rate received by an individual while employed by the government of the District of Columbia who was first employed by that government on or after October 1, 1987;
(e) A rate received by an individual while employed by a Department of Defense or Coast Guard nonappropriated fund instrumentality;
(f) A rate received solely during a period of interim relief under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A);
(g) A special rate established under 5 U.S.C. 5305 and 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or 38 U.S.C. 7455 (except as provided in § 531.222(c));
(h) A rate received under a void appointment or a rate otherwise contrary to applicable law or regulation;
(i) A rate received as a member of the uniformed services; or
(j) A retained rate under 5 U.S.C. 5363 or a similar rate under another legal authority.

# Special Rules for GM Employees
§ 531.241
Retaining and losing GM status.
(a) An employee retains status as a GM employee (as defined in § 531.203) when detailed to any position or when reassigned to another GS position in which the employee continues to be a supervisor or management official (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(10) and (11)).
(b) An employee permanently loses status as a GM employee if he or she is promoted (including a temporary promotion), transferred, demoted, reassigned to a position in which the employee will no longer be a supervisor or management official, has a break in service of more than 3 days, or becomes entitled to a retained rate under 5 CFR part 536. (A retained grade is not considered in determining whether a GM employee has been reduced in grade. See 5 CFR 536.205.)
§ 531.242
Setting pay upon loss of GM status.
(a) On loss of status as a GM employee under § 531.241 (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section), an employee must receive his or her existing payable rate of basic pay, plus any of the following adjustments that may be applicable on the effective date of the loss of status, in the order specified:
(1) The amount of any annual adjustment in GS rates under 5 U.S.C. 5303, and the amount of any adjustment in locality payments or special rate supplements, to which the employee otherwise would be entitled on that date;
(2) The amount of any within-grade increase to which the employee otherwise would be entitled on that date under 5 U.S.C. 5335 and subpart D of this part;
(3) The amount resulting from a promotion effective on that date (consistent with § 531.243(c));
(4) In the case of an employee who loses GM status without a change of grade and whose GS rate falls between two steps of a GS grade, the amount of any increase needed to pay the employee the rate for the next higher step of that grade; and
(5) In the case of an employee whose resulting GS rate is below the minimum rate of a GS grade, the amount of any increase needed to pay the employee the minimum rate for that grade.
(b) For an employee who loses status as a GM employee as a result of a demotion, pay must be set as provided in § 531.215. A GM employee's off-step GS rate at the grade before demotion is not converted to a GS step rate before the demotion, but the employee must be placed on a GS step rate when pay is set in the lower grade.
§ 531.243
Promotion of a GM employee.
(a) Upon promotion, an employee's status as a GM employee ends, as provided in § 531.241(b).
(b) When an employee loses status as a GM employee because of a temporary promotion and is returned to the lower grade upon expiration or termination of the temporary promotion under § 531.215(c)(1), he or she will be deemed to have been placed at the lowest step rate that equals or exceeds the employee's former GS rate (as a GM employee) on the effective date of the temporary promotion, before applying any other step increases based on his or her service during the temporary promotion.
(c) A GM employee's GS rate is used as the existing rate of pay in applying the promotion rule in § 531.214. A GM employee's off-step GS rate in the grade before promotion is not converted to a GS step rate in applying the promotion rule, but the employee must be placed on a GS step rate in the post-promotion grade.
§ 531.244
Adjusting a GM employee's rate at the time of an annual pay adjustment.
(a) On the effective date of an annual pay adjustment under 5 U.S.C. 5303 or similar authority, an agency must set the new GS rate for a GM employee as follows:
(1) For a GM employee whose GS rate equals a regular GS step rate, set the employee's rate at the new step rate in the adjusted General Schedule that
corresponds to the employee's grade and step as in effect immediately before the effective date of the pay adjustment.
(2) For a GM employee whose GS rate is below the minimum rate of the GS rate range for the employee's grade, increase the existing GS rate by the same percentage as the annual pay adjustment for the GS rate range applicable to the employee's grade, with the result rounded to the nearest dollar (not to exceed the minimum rate of the range).
(3) For a GM employee whose GS rate is between GS step rates, apply the following method:
Step A
Using the rates and ranges in effect immediately
before
the annual pay adjustment, find the difference between the GM employee's GS rate and the minimum rate of the GS rate range for the employee's grade.
Step B
Find the difference between the maximum rate and minimum rate of the GS rate range in effect immediately before the annual pay adjustment. (If the GS maximum rate was not payable because of the EX level V pay limitation in 5 U.S.C. 5303(f), use the uncapped maximum rate.)
Step C
Divide the result from step A by the result from step B. Carry this result to the seventh decimal place and truncate, rather than round, the result. This decimal factor represents the employee's relative position in the rate range.
Step D
Using rates and ranges in effect
after
the annual pay adjustment, find the difference between the maximum rate and minimum rate of the new GS rate range for the employee's grade. (If the GS maximum rate was not payable because of the EX level V pay limitation, use the uncapped maximum rate.)
Step E
Multiply the result from step D by the factor derived from step C.
Step F
Add the result from step E to the minimum rate of the employee's current GS rate range and round to the next higher whole dollar. The resulting rate is the GM employee's new GS rate (subject to the EX level V pay limitation).
(b) [Reserved]
[70 FR 31291, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 66153, Nov. 7, 2008]
§ 531.245
Computing locality rates and special rates for GM employees.
Locality rates and special rates are computed for GM employees in the same manner as locality rates and special rates for other GS employees. The applicable locality payment or special rate supplement is added on top of the GM employee's GS rate.
§ 531.246
Within-grade increases for GM employees.
GM employees are entitled to within-grade increases as provided under subpart D of this part. A within-grade increase may not cause a GM employee's GS rate to exceed the maximum GS rate of his or her grade. GM employees may receive quality step increases as provided in subpart E of this part.
[73 FR 66153, Nov. 7, 2008]
§ 531.247
Maximum payable rate rule for GM employees.
(a) A rate received by a GM employee may qualify as a highest previous rate under § 531.222.
(b) As provided in §§ 531.221(a) and 531.241(b), if an employee loses status as a GM employee because of a transfer, promotion, demotion, or reassignment to a position in which the employee will no longer be a supervisor or management official, and if the employing agency after the action chooses to apply the maximum payable rate rule, the agency must follow the rules in § 531.221.
(c) If an employee retains GM status after an action that allows application of the maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221 to set the employee's pay, the rules in § 531.221 must be applied in accordance with the following special provisions:
(1) In comparing the employee's highest previous rate to an applicable rate range for the grade in which pay is being set, do not identify the lowest step rate that equals or exceeds the highest previous rate. Instead, identify the rate in the rate range that equals the highest previous rate unless that highest previous rate is below the range minimum or above the range maximum. If the highest previous rate is below the range minimum, identify the minimum rate (step 1) of the grade. If the highest previous rate is above the range maximum, identify the maximum rate (step 10) of the grade.
(2) In applying § 531.221(b) for an employee whose highest previous rate is a GS rate, the highest previous rate must be compared to the GS rate range for the grade in which pay is currently
being set, but which was in effect at the time the highest previous rate was earned. If the highest previous rate was earned while the current GS rate range was in effect, the rate identified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is the maximum payable GS rate. Otherwise, based on the rate identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the agency must determine the corresponding rate in the current GS rate range for the grade in which pay is currently being set. That corresponding rate is the maximum payable GS rate. If the highest previous rate was above the range minimum and below the range maximum, the corresponding rate in the current GS rate range must be derived as follows:
Step A
Find the difference between the employee's highest previous rate and the minimum rate for the GS rate range (for the employee's current grade) in effect at the time the highest previous rate was earned.
Step B
Find the difference between the maximum rate and the minimum GS rate for the rate range identified in step A. (If the GS maximum rate was not payable because of the EX level V pay limitation, use the uncapped maximum rate.)
Step C
Divide the result from step A by the result from step B. Carry this result to the seventh decimal place and truncate, rather than round, the result. This decimal factor represents the employee's relative position in the rate range.
Step D
Using the current GS rate range (for the employee's current grade), find the difference between the maximum rate and the minimum rate. (If the maximum GS rate was not payable because of the EX level V pay limitation, use the uncapped maximum GS rate.)
Step E
Multiply the result from step D by the factor derived under step C.
Step F
Add the result from step E to the minimum rate for the employee's current GS rate range and round to the next higher whole dollar. This rate is the maximum payable GS rate the agency may pay the employee (subject to the EX level V pay limitation).
(3) In applying § 531.221(c) for an employee whose highest previous rate is a special rate, the highest previous rate (after any geographic conversion) must be compared directly to the current highest applicable rate range for the employee's position of record and official worksite after reassignment. Thus, the rate identified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is the maximum payable rate of basic pay.

§ 531.403
Definitions.
In this subpart:
Acceptable level of competence
means performance by an employee that warrants advancement of the employee's rate of basic pay to the next higher step of the grade or the next higher rate within the grade (as defined in this section) of his or her position, subject to the requirements of § 531.404 of this subpart, as determined by the head of the agency (or designee).
Agency
means an agency with employees covered by this subpart, as provided in § 531.402.
Calendar week
means a period of any seven consecutive calendar days.
Critical element
has the meaning given that term in § 430.203 of this chapter.
Employee
has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105, except that for the purpose of applying the provisions regarding equivalent increases and creditable service with respect to non-GS service,
employee
also includes—
(1) An individual employed by the U.S. Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission who would be considered an employee under 5 U.S.C. 2105 but for the exclusion in section 2105(e); and
(2) An individual employed by a nonappropriated fund instrumentality for service that is creditable under § 531.406(b)(4).
Equivalent increase
means an increase in an employee's rate of basic pay, or an opportunity for such an increase under a non-GS pay system, as described in § 531.407.
General Schedule
or
GS
means the classification and pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53. The term also refers to the pay schedule of GS rates established under 5 U.S.C. 5332, as adjusted under 5 U.S.C. 5303 or other law (including GS rates payable to GM employees). Law enforcement officers receiving LEO special base rates are covered by the GS classification and pay system, but receive higher base rates of pay in lieu of GS rates at grades GS-3 through GS-10.
GM employee
has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 531.203.
GS rate
means a rate of basic pay within the General Schedule, excluding additional pay of any kind such as locality payments under subpart F of this part and special rate supplements under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or 38 U.S.C. 7455. A rate payable to a GM employee is considered a GS rate.
Law enforcement officer
or
LEO
has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 550.103.
LEO special base rate
means a special base rate established for GS law enforcement officers at grades GS-3 through GS-10 under section 403 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub. L. 101-509, November 5, 1990, as amended) which is used in lieu of a GS rate.
Next higher rate within the grade
for a GM employee means the rate of basic pay that exceeds the employee's existing rate of basic pay by one within-grade increase, not to exceed the maximum rate of the grade. For the purpose of this definition, a within-grade increase equals the dollar value of the GS within-grade increase for the applicable grade (excluding any locality payment, special rate supplement, or any other additional payment).
Permanent position
means a position filled by an employee whose appointment is not designated as temporary by law and does not have a definite time limitation of one year or less.
“Permanent position” includes a position to which an employee is promoted on a temporary or term basis for at least one year.
Promotion
means an employee's movement from one grade or level to a higher grade or level while continuously employed (including such a movement in conjunction with a transfer).
Rate of basic pay
means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee before any deductions and exclusive of additional pay of any kind. For an employee covered by the General Schedule, that
rate of basic pay
is the GS rate or, if applicable, an LEO special base rate.
Scheduled tour of duty
means any work schedule established for an employee in accordance with the regular procedures for the establishment of workweeks in § 610.111 of this chapter. For a full-time employee this includes the basic 40-hour workweek. For a part-time employee this is any regularly scheduled work of less than 40-hours during the administrative workweek.
Temporary promotion
means a time-limited promotion with a not-to-exceed date or a specified term.
Waiting period
means the minimum time requirement of creditable service to become eligible for consideration for a within-grade increase.
Within-grade increase
is synonymous with the term “step increase” used in 5 U.S.C. 5335 and means—* *
(1) A periodic increase in an employee's rate of basic pay from one step of the grade of his or her position to the next higher step of that grade in accordance with section 5335 of title 5, United States Code, and this subpart; or
(2) For a GM employee whose rate does not equal a regular GS step rate (
i.e.
, an off-step rate), a periodic increase in an employee's rate of basic pay from the employee's current rate to the next higher rate within the grade (as defined in this section) consistent with section 4 of Public Law 103-89.

§ 531.404
Earning within-grade increase.
An employee paid at less than the maximum rate of the grade of his or her position shall earn advancement in pay to the next higher step of the grade or the next higher rate within the grade (as defined in § 531.403) upon meeting the following three requirements established by law:
(a) The employee's performance must be at an acceptable level of competence, as defined in this subpart. To be determined at an acceptable level of competence, the employee's most recent rating of record (as defined in § 430.203 of this chapter) shall be at least Level 3 (“Fully Successful” or equivalent).
(1) When a within-grade increase decision is not consistent with the employee's most recent rating of record a more current rating of record must be prepared.
(2) The rating of record used as the basis for an acceptable level of competence determination for a within-grade increase must have been assigned no earlier than the most recently completed appraisal period.
(b) The employee must have completed the required waiting period for advancement to the next higher step of the grade of his or her position.
(c) The employee must not have received an equivalent increase during the waiting period.
[51 FR 8420, Mar. 11, 1986, as amended at 58 FR 65536, Dec. 15, 1993; 60 FR 43948, Aug. 23, 1995]
§ 531.405
Waiting periods for within-grade increase.
(a)
Length of waiting period.
(1) For an employee with a scheduled tour of duty, the waiting periods for advancement to the next higher step in all General Schedule grades (or the next higher rate within the grade, as defined in § 531.403) are:
(i) Rate of basic pay less than the rate of basic pay at step 4-52 calendar weeks of creditable service;

(iii) Rate of basic pay equal to or greater than the rate of basic pay at step 7-156 calendar weeks of creditable service.
(2) For an employee without a scheduled tour of duty, the waiting periods for advancement to the next higher step of all General Schedule grades (or the next higher rate within the grade, as defined in § 531.403) are:
(i) Rate of basic pay less than the rate of basic pay at step 4-260 days of creditable service in a pay status over a period of not less than 52 calendar weeks;
(ii) Rate of basic pay equal to or greater than the rate of basic pay at step 4 and less than the rate of basic pay at step 7-520 days of creditable service in a pay status over a period of not less than 104 calendar weeks; and

(b)
Commencement of a waiting period.
A waiting period begins;
(1) On the first appointment as an employee of the Federal Government, regardless of tenure;
(2) On receiving an equivalent increase; or
(3) After a period of nonpay status or a break in service (alone or in combination) in excess of 52 calendar weeks, unless the nonpay status or break in service is creditable service under § 531.406 of this subpart.
(c) A waiting period is not interrupted by non-workdays intervening between an employee's last scheduled workday in one position and his or her first scheduled workday in a new position.
[46 FR 2319, Jan. 9, 1981, as amended at 58 FR 65536, Dec. 15, 1993; 59 FR 40794, Aug. 10, 1994]
§ 531.406
Creditable service.
(a)
General.
Civilian employment in any branch of the Federal Government (executive, legislative, or judicial) or with a Government corporation as defined in section 103 of title 5, United States Code, is creditable service in the computation of a waiting period. Service credit is given during this employment for periods of annual, sick, and other leave with pay; advanced annual and sick leave; service under a temporary or term appointment; and service under an interim appointment made under § 772.102 of this chapter. Depending on the specific provision of law or regulation, service may be creditable for the completion of one waiting period or for the completion of successive waiting periods. Paragraph (b) of this section identifies service which is creditable in the computation of a single waiting period. Paragraph (c) identifies service which is creditable in the computation of successive waiting periods.
(b)
Service creditable for one within-grade increase.
(1) Military service as defined in section 8331(13) of title 5, United States Code, is creditable service in the computation of a waiting period when an employee is reemployed with the Federal Government not later than 52 calendar weeks after separation from such service or hospitalization continuing thereafter for a period of not more than one year.
(2) Time in a nonpay status (based upon the tour of duty from which the time was charged) is creditable service in the computation of a waiting period for an employee with a scheduled tour of duty when it does not exceed an aggregate of:
(i) Two workweeks in the waiting period for an employee whose rate of basic pay is less than the rate of basic pay for step 4 of the applicable grade;
(ii) Four workweeks in the waiting period for an employee whose rate of basic pay is equal to or greater than the rate of basic pay for step 4 of the applicable grade and less than the rate of basic pay for step 7 of the applicable grade; and
(iii) Six workweeks in the waiting period for an employee whose rate of basic pay is equal to or greater than the rate of basic pay for step 7 of the applicable grade.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, time in a nonpay
status (based upon the tour of duty from which the time was charged) that is in excess of the allowable amount shall extend a waiting period by the excess amount.
(4) Service by an employee of a nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c), who moves, within the civil service employment system of the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively, and without a break in service of more than 3 days, to a position classified and paid under the General Schedule, is creditable service in the computation of a waiting period.
(c)
Service creditable for succesive within-grade increases.
(1) A leave of absence from a position in which an employee is covered by this subpart, whether the employee is on leave without pay or is considered to be on furlough, is creditable service in the computation of waiting periods for successive within-grade increases when:
(i) The employee is absent for the purpose of engaging in military service as defined in section 8331(13) of title 5, United States Code, and returns to a pay status through the exercise of a restoration right provided by law, Executive order, or regulation;
(ii) The employee is receiving injury compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code;
(iii) The employee is performing service that is creditable under section 8332(b) (5) or (7) of title 5, United States Code;
(iv) The employee is temporarily employed by another agency in a position covered by this subpart; or
(v) The employee is assigned to a State or local government or institution of higher education under sections 3371-3376 of title 5, United States Code.
(2) The period from the date of an employee's separation from Federal service with a restoration or reemployment right granted by law, Executive order, or regulation to the date of restoration or reemployment with the Federal Government through the exercise of that right is creditable service in the computation of waiting periods for successive within-grade increases.
(3) The period during which a separated employee is in receipt of injury compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, as a result of an injury incurred by the employee in the performance of duty is creditable service in the computation of waiting periods for successive within-grade increases when the employee is reemployed with the Federal Government.

§ 531.407
Equivalent increase determinations.
(a)
GS employees.
For a GS employee, an equivalent increase is considered to occur at the time of any of the following personnel actions:
(1) A within-grade increase, excluding a quality step increase granted under subpart E of this part or an interim within-grade increase if that increase is later terminated under § 531.414;
(2) A promotion (permanent or temporary) to a higher grade, including the promotion of an employee receiving a retained rate under 5 CFR 359.705 or 5 CFR part 536 that does not result in a pay increase, but excluding—
(i) A temporary promotion if, at the end of the that temporary promotion, the employee is returned to the grade from which promoted; or
(ii) A promotion to a higher-graded supervisory or managerial position when the employee does not satisfactorily complete a probationary period established under 5 U.S.C. 3321(a)(2) and is returned to a position at the lower grade held before promotion;
(3) Application of the maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221 that results in a higher step rate within the employee's GS grade (or an increase for a GM employee to the next higher rate within the grade), except for application of that rule in a demotion to the extent that the employee's rate of basic pay after demotion does not exceed the lowest step rate that equals or exceeds the employee's rate of basic pay immediately before the demotion;
(4) Application of the superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority in § 531.212 that results in a higher step rate within the employee's GS grade (or an increase for a GM employee to the next higher rate within the grade); or
(5) Application of the qualifications pay authority in 5 U.S.C. 9814 to an employee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, when the employee fulfills the 1-year service requirement in the position for which qualifications pay was paid or in a successor position.
(b)
Non-GS employees who move to the GS pay system.
When an employee performs service under a non-GS pay system for Federal employees and that service is potentially creditable towards a GS within-grade increase waiting period, an equivalent increase is considered to occur at the time of any of the following personnel actions in the non-GS pay system:
(1) A promotion to a higher grade or work level within the non-GS pay system (unless the promotion is cancelled and the employee's rate of basic pay is redetermined as if the promotion had not occurred); or
(2) An opportunity to receive a within-level or within-range increase that results in forward movement in the applicable range of rates of basic pay (including an increase granted immediately upon movement to the non-GS pay system from another pay system—e.g., to account for the value of accrued within-grade increases under the former pay system or to provide a promotion-equivalent increase), where “forward movement in the applicable range” means any kind of increase in the employee's rate of basic pay other than an increase that is directly and exclusively linked to—
(i) A general structural increase in the employee's basic pay schedule or rate range (including the adjustment of a range minimum or maximum); or
(ii) The employee's placement under a new basic pay schedule within the same pay system, when such placement results in a nondiscretionary basic pay increase to account for occupational pay differences.
(c)
Locality rates and special rates.
Since locality rates under subpart F of this part and special rates under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, and similar rates under other legal authority (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 7455) are not rates of basic pay for the purpose of this subpart, increases in pay resulting from an adjustment in an employee's locality payment or special rate supplement or from placement on a new locality rate or special rate schedule are not considered in making equivalent increase determinations.
[70 FR 31301, May 31, 2005, as amended at 70 FR 74995, Dec. 19, 2005; 73 FR 66153, Nov. 7, 2008]
§ 531.408
[Reserved]
§ 531.409
Acceptable level of competence determinations.
(a)
Responsibility.
The head of the agency or other agency official to whom such authority is delegated shall determine which employees are performing at an acceptable level of competence.
(b)
Basis for determination.
When applicable, an acceptable level of competence determination shall be based on a current rating of record made under part 430, subpart B, of this chapter. For those agencies not covered by chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code, and for employees in positions excluded from 5 U.S.C. 4301, an acceptable level of competence determination shall be based on performance appraisal requirements established by the agency. If an employee has been reduced in grade because of unacceptable performance and has served in one position at the lower grade for at least the minimum period established by the agency, a rating of record at the lower grade shall be used as the basis for an acceptable level of competence determination.
(c)
Delay in determination.
(1) An acceptable level of competence determination shall be delayed when, and only when, either of the following applies:
(i) An employee has not had the minimum period of time established at § 430.207(a) of this chapter to demonstrate acceptable performance because he or she has not been informed of the specific requirements for performance at an acceptable level of
competence in his or her current position, and the employee has not been given a performance rating in any position within the minimum period of time (as established at § 430.207(a) of this chapter) before the end of the waiting period; or
(ii) An employee is reduced in grade because of unacceptable performance to a position in which he or she is eligible for a within-grade increase or will become eligible within the minimum period as established at § 430.207(a) of this chapter.
(2) When an acceptable level of competence determination has been delayed under this subpart:
(i) The employee shall be informed that his or her determination is postponed and the appraisal period extended and shall be told of the specific requirements for performance at an acceptable level of competence.
(ii) An acceptable level of competence determination shall then be made based on the employee's rating of record completed at the end of the extended appraisal period.
(iii) If, following the delay, the employee's performance is determined to be at an acceptable level of competence, the within-grade increase will be granted retroactively to the beginning of the pay period following completion of the applicable waiting period.
(d)
Waiver of requirement for determination.
(1) An acceptable level of competence determination shall be waived and a within-grade increase granted when an employee has not served in any position for the minimum period under an applicable agency performance appraisal program during the final 52 calendar weeks of the waiting period for one or more of the following reasons:
(i) Because of absences that are creditable service in the computation of a waiting period or periods under § 531.406 of this subpart;
(ii) Because of paid leave;
(iii) Because the employee received service credit under the back pay provisions of subpart H of part 550 of this chapter;
(iv) Because of details to another agency or employer for which no rating has been prepared;
(v) Because the employee has had insufficient time to demonstrate an acceptable level of competence due to authorized activities of official interest to the agency not subject to appraisal under part 430 of this chapter (including, but not limited to, labor-management partnership activities under section 2 of Executive Order 12871 and serving as a representative of a labor organization under chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code); or
(vi) Because of long-term training.
(2) When an acceptable level of competence determination has been waived and a within-grade increase granted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, there shall be a presumption that the employee would have performed at an acceptable level of competence had the employee performed the duties of his or her position of record for the minimum period under the applicable agency performance appraisal program.
(e)
Notice of determination.
(1) A level of competence determination shall be communicated to an employee in writing as soon as possible after completion of the waiting period or other period upon which it was based.
(2) When the head of an agency or his or her designee determines that an employee's performance is not at an acceptable level of competence, the negative determination shall be communicated to the employee in writing and shall:
(i) Set forth the reasons for any negative determination and the respects in which the employee must improve his or her performance in order to be granted a within-grade increase under § 531.411 of this subpart.
(ii) Inform the employee of his or her right to request that the appropriately designated agency official reconsider the determination.

§ 531.410
Reconsideration of a negative determination.
(a) When an agency head, or his or her designee, issues a negative determination the following procedures are established in accordance with section 5335(c) of title 5, United States Code for
reconsideration of the negative determination:
(1) An employee or an employee's personal representative may request reconsideration of a negative determination by filing, not more than 15 days after receiving notice of determination, a written response to the negative determination setting forth the reasons the agency shall reconsider the determination;
(2) When an employee files a request for reconsideration, the agency shall establish an employee reconsideration file which shall contain all pertinent documents relating to the negative determination and the request for reconsideration, including copies of the following:
(i) The written negative determination and the basis therefore;
(ii) The employee's written request for reconsideration;
(iii) The report of investigation when an investigation is made;
(iv) The written summary or transcript of any personal presentation made; and
(v) The agency's decision on the request for reconsideration.
The file shall not contain any document that has not been made available to the employee or his or her personal representative with an opportunity to submit a written exception to any summary of the employee's personal presentation;
(3) An employee in a duty status shall be granted a reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied upon to support the negative determination and to prepare a response to the determination; and
(4) The agency shall provide the employee with a prompt written final decision.
(b) The time limit to request a reconsideration may be extended when the employee shows he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that the employee was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from requesting reconsideration within the time limit.
(c) An agency may disallow as an employee's personal representative an individual whose activities as a representative would cause a conflict of interest of position, an employee whose release from his or her official duties and responsibilities would give rise to unreasonable costs to the Government, or an employee whose priority work assignment precludes his or her release from official duties and responsibilities. Section 7114 of title 5, United States Code, and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement govern representation for employees in an exclusive bargaining unit.
(d) When a negative determination is sustained after reconsideration, an employee shall be informed in writing of the reasons for the decision and of his or her right to appeal the decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board. However, for an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement a reconsideration decision that sustains a negative determination is only reviewable in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

§ 531.411
Continuing evaluation after withholding a within-grade increase.
When a within-grade increase has been withheld, an agency may, at any time thereafter, prepare a new rating of record for the employee and grant the within-grade increase when it determines that he or she has demonstrated sustained performance at an acceptable level of competence. However, the agency shall determine whether the employee's performance is at an acceptable level of competence after no more than 52 calendar weeks following the original eligibility date for the within-grade increase and, for as long as the within-grade increase continues to be denied, determinations will be made after no longer than each 52 calendar weeks.

Effective date of a within-grade increase.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a within-grade increase shall be effective on the first day of the first pay period following
completion of the required waiting period and in compliance with the conditions of eligibility. Interim within-grade increases shall become effective as provided in § 541.414(b).
(b) When an acceptable level of competence is achieved at some time after a negative determination, the effective date is the first day of the first pay period after the acceptable determination has been made.

Nomenclature changes to subpart F of part 531 appear at 70 FR 31305, May 31, 2005.
§ 531.601
Purpose.
This subpart contains Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5304, which authorizes locality payments in defined geographic areas for GS employees and other categories of employees to whom locality payments are extended. These regulations must be read together with 5 U.S.C. 5304.
[70 FR 31302, May 31, 2005]
§ 531.602
Definitions.
In this subpart:
CSA
means the geographic scope of a Combined Statistical Area, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in OMB Bulletin No. 20-01.
Employee
means—
(1) An employee in a position to which 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter III, applies, including a GM employee, and whose official worksite is located in a locality pay area; and
(2) An employee in a category of positions described in 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)(1)(A)-(D) for which the President (or designee) has authorized locality-based comparability payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)(2) and whose official worksite is located in a locality pay area.
General Schedule
or
GS
means the classification and pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53. It also refers to the pay schedule of GS rates established under 5 U.S.C. 5332, as adjusted under 5 U.S.C. 5303 or other law
(including GS rates payable to GM employees). Law enforcement officers (LEOs) receiving LEO special base rates are covered by the GS classification and pay system, but receive higher base rates of pay in lieu of GS rates at grades GS-3 through GS-10.
GM employee
has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 531.203.
GS rate
means a rate of basic pay within the General Schedule, excluding any LEO special base rate and additional pay of any kind such as locality payments or special rate supplements. A rate payable to a GM employee is considered a GS rate.
Law enforcement officer
or
LEO
has the meaning given that term in 5 CFR 550.103.
LEO special base rate
means a special base rate established for GS law enforcement officers at grades GS-3 through GS-10 under section 403 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub. L. 101-509, November 5, 1990, as amended) which is used in lieu of a GS rate.
Locality pay area
means an area listed in § 531.603 of this part, as established and modified under 5 U.S.C. 5304 by the Pay Agent designated by the President under 5 U.S.C. 5304(d)(1).
Locality payment
means a locality-based comparability payment payable under 5 U.S.C. 5304 and this subpart. An employee's locality payment is the difference between the employee's locality rate and the employee's scheduled annual rate of pay.
Locality pay percentage
means the percentage authorized for a locality pay area under 5 U.S.C. 5304 or 5304a which is used to compute a locality payment (before applying any maximum pay limitations under § 531.606).
Locality rate
means a scheduled annual rate of pay plus an applicable locality payment. An employee's locality rate is computed under § 531.604.
MSA
means the geographic scope of a Metropolitan Statistical Area, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in OMB Bulletin No. 20-01.
Official worksite
means the official location of an employee's position of record as determined under § 531.605.
Position of record
means an employee's official position (defined by grade, occupational series, employing agency, LEO status, and any other condition that determines coverage under a pay schedule (other than official worksite)), as documented on the employee's most recent Notification of Personnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent) and current position description. A position to which an employee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record. For an employee whose change in official position is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee's separation before he or she is required to report for duty in the new position, the position of record in effect immediately before the position change is deemed to remain the position of record through the date of separation.
Rate range
or
range
means a range of rates of basic pay for a grade within an established pay schedule, excluding any retained rate. A rate range may consist of GS rates, LEO special base rates, locality rates, special rates, or, for non-GS employees, similar rates under other legal authority.
Retained rate
means a rate above the maximum rate of the rate range applicable to the employee which is payable under 5 CFR part 536 or similar legal authority.
Scheduled annual rate of pay
means, as applicable—
(1) The annual GS rate payable to an employee;
(2) An annual LEO special base rate; or
(3) For an employee in a category of positions described in 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)(1)(A)-(D) for which the President (or designee) has authorized locality payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)(2), the annual rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action, exclusive of any locality-based adjustments (including adjustments equivalent to local special rate supplements under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C) or additional pay of any other kind.
Special rate
means a rate of pay within a special rate schedule established under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or a similar rate established under other legal authority (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 7455). The term
special rate
does not include an LEO special base rate.
Special rate schedule
means a pay schedule established under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, to provide higher rates of pay for specified categories of positions or employees at one or more grades or levels or a similar schedule established under other legal authority (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 7455).
Special rate supplement
means the portion of a special rate paid above an employee's scheduled annual rate of pay. However, for a law enforcement officer receiving an LEO special base rate who is also entitled to a special rate, the special rate supplement equals the portion of the special rate paid above the officer's LEO special base rate. When a special rate schedule covers both LEO positions and other positions, the value of the special rate supplement will be less for law enforcement officers receiving an LEO special base rate (since that rate is higher than the corresponding GS rate). The payable amount of a special rate supplement is subject to the Executive Schedule level IV limitation on special rates, as provided in 5 CFR 530.304(a).
Telework agreement
means a formal oral or written agreement between a supervisor and an employee to permit the employee to work at an alternative worksite (
i.e.
, telework) instead of the location of the employee's assigned organization.

(3) An agency must document an employee's official worksite on an employee's Notification of Personnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent).
(b) For an employee who is relocated and authorized to receive relocation expenses under 5 U.S.C. chapter 57, subchapter II (or similar authority), the official worksite is the established worksite for the position in the area to which the employee has been relocated. For an employee authorized to receive relocation expenses under 5 U.S.C. 5737 in connection with an extended assignment resulting in a temporary change of station, the worksite associated with the extended assignment is the official worksite. (See 41 CFR 302-1.1.)
(c) For an employee whose assignment to a new worksite is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee's separation before he or she is required to report for duty at the new location, the official worksite in effect immediately before the assignment remains the official worksite through the date of separation.
(d) For an employee covered by a telework agreement, the following rules apply:
(1) If the employee is scheduled to work at least twice each biweekly pay period on a regular and recurring basis at the regular worksite for the employee's position of record, the regular worksite (where the employee's work activities are based) is the employee's official worksite. However, in the case of such an employee whose work location varies on a recurring basis, the employee need not work at least twice each biweekly pay period at the regular official worksite (where the employee's work activities are based) as long as the employee is regularly performing work within the locality pay area for that worksite.
(2) An authorized agency official may make an exception to the twice-in-a-pay-period standard in paragraph (d)(1) of this section in appropriate situations of a temporary nature, such as the following:
(i) An employee is recovering from an injury or medical condition;
(ii) An employee is affected by an emergency situation, which temporarily prevents the employee from commuting to his or her regular official worksite;
(iii) An employee has an extended approved absence from work (e.g., paid leave);
(iv) An employee is in temporary duty travel status away from the official worksite; or
(v) An employee is temporarily detailed to work at a location other than a location covered by a telework agreement.
(3) If an employee covered by a telework agreement does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, the employee's official worksite is the location of the employee's telework site.
(4) An agency must determine a telework employee's official worksite on a case-by-case basis. A determination made under this paragraph (d) is within the sole and exclusive discretion of the authorized agency official, subject only to OPM review and oversight.
(e) In applying paragraph (d) of this section for the purpose of other location-based pay entitlements under other regulations that refer to this section, the reference to a
locality pay area
is deemed to be a reference to the applicable geographic area associated with the given pay entitlement. For example, for the purpose of special rates under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, the reference to a
locality pay area
is deemed to be a reference to the geographic area covered by a special rate schedule.
[73 FR 66154, Nov. 7, 2008]
§ 531.606
Maximum limits on locality rates.
(a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, a locality rate may not exceed the rate of basic pay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule.
(b)(1) A locality rate for an employee in a category of positions described in 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)(1)(A) and 5304(h)(1)(B) may not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule.
(2) A locality rate for an employee in a category of positions described in 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)(1)(C) may not exceed—
(i) The rate for level III of the Executive Schedule, when the positions are not covered by an appraisal system certified under 5 U.S.C. 5307(d); or
(ii) The rate for level II of the Executive Schedule, when the positions are covered by an appraisal system certified under 5 U.S.C. 5307(d).
(3) A locality rate for an employee in a category of positions described in 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)(1)(D) may not exceed—
(i) The rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule, when the maximum scheduled annual rate of pay (excluding any retained rate) for such positions is less than or equal to the maximum payable scheduled annual rate of pay for GS-15; or
(ii) The rate for level III of the Executive Schedule, when the maximum scheduled annual rate of pay (excluding any retained rate) for such positions exceeds the maximum payable scheduled annual rate of pay for GS-15, but is not more than the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule.
(4) If initial application of paragraph (b)(3) of this section otherwise would reduce an employee's existing locality rate, the employee's locality rate is capped at the higher of—
(i) The amount of the employee's locality rate on the day before paragraph (b)(3) of this section was initially applied; or
(ii) The rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule.
(c) Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to experts and consultants appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3109 if the pay for those experts and consultants is limited to the highest rate payable under 5 U.S.C. 5332 (
i.e.
, the unadjusted maximum GS-15 rate). Such experts and consultants are subject to the pay limitations established in 5 CFR 304.105.
(d) A portion of a locality payment that is not payable because of an applicable limitation is not considered in applying any other provision of law or regulation.
[70 FR 31304, May 31, 2005, as amended at 76 FR 32863, June 7, 2011]
§ 531.607
Computing hourly, daily, weekly, and biweekly locality rates.
(a) Apply the following methods to convert an annual locality rate to an hourly, daily, weekly, or biweekly rate:
(1) To derive an hourly rate, divide the annual locality rate by 2,087 and round to the nearest cent, counting one-half cent and over as the next higher cent.
Example:
Annual locality rate = $50,000
Computation of hourly rate: $50,000 ÷ 2,087 = 23.957 or $23.96.
(2) To derive a daily rate, multiply the hourly rate by the number of daily hours of service required by the employee's basic daily tour of duty.
Example:
Hourly rate = $23.96
Daily hours = 8
Computation of daily rate: $23.96 × 8 = $191.68
(3) To derive a weekly or biweekly rate, multiply the hourly rate by 40 or 80, as applicable.
Example:
Hourly rate = $23.96
Biweekly hours = 80
Computation of biweekly rate: $23.96 × 80 = $1,916.80
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, for a firefighter whose pay is computed under 5 U.S.C. 5545b, a firefighter hourly locality rate is computed using a divisor of 2,756 hours instead of 2,087, as prescribed in 5 CFR part 550, subpart M. Also, such a firefighter's weekly and biweekly locality rates must be based on the firefighter's extended tour of duty as prescribed in that subpart.
[70 FR 31304, May 31, 2005]
§ 531.608
Relationship of locality rates to other pay rates.
(a) An employee must receive the greatest of the following rates of pay, as applicable—
(1) The scheduled annual rate of pay payable to the employee;
(2) A locality rate under this subpart;
(3) A special rate under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or a similar rate under other legal authority (e.g., 38 U.S.C. 7455); or
(4) A retained rate under 5 CFR part 536 or a similar rate under other legal authority.
(b) A GS employee receiving a special rate is entitled to any applicable locality payment on the same basis as any other GS employee. The locality payment is computed based on the employee's scheduled annual rate of pay, which excludes any special rate. The employee is entitled to the higher of the locality rate or the corresponding special rate. As provided in 5 U.S.C. 5305(h) and 5 CFR 530.303(d), when an employee's locality rate exceeds a corresponding special rate, the employee's entitlement to the special rate is terminated.
[70 FR 31304, May 31, 2005]
§ 531.609
Adjusting or terminating locality rates.
(a) When an employee's official worksite is changed to a different locality pay area, the employee's entitlement to the locality rate for the new locality pay area begins on the effective date of the change in official worksite.
(b) A locality rate must be adjusted as of the effective date of any change in the applicable scheduled annual rate of pay or any change in the applicable locality percentage.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, entitlement to a locality rate associated with a particular locality pay area under this subpart terminates on the date—
(1) An employee's official worksite is no longer in the locality pay area;
(2) An employee is no longer in a position covered by this subpart; or
(3) An employee separates from Federal service.
(d) In the event of a change in the geographic coverage of a locality pay area, the effective date of any change in an employee's entitlement to a locality rate of pay under this subpart is the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the effective date indicated in the applicable final rule published in the
Federal Register.
(e) As provided in § 531.205, when an employee becomes covered by one or more different pay schedule(s) because the employee is stationed at a new official worksite in a different geographic location, the employee's pay (including a locality rate) must first be converted to the applicable pay schedule(s) in the new location before applying any other pay action (other than a general pay adjustment).
[70 FR 31304, May 31, 2005, as amended at 72 FR 34363, June 22, 2007; 78 FR 5115, Jan. 24, 2013]
§ 531.610
Treatment of locality rate as basic pay.
A locality rate is considered to be an employee's rate of basic pay only for the purpose of computing or applying—
(a) Retirement deductions, contributions, and benefits under 5 U.S.C. chapters 83 and 84;
(b) Life insurance premiums and benefits under 5 U.S.C. chapter 87;
(c) Premium pay under 5 U.S.C. chapter 55, subchapter V, and 5 CFR part 550, subparts A and I (including the computation of limitations on premium pay);
(d) Severance pay under 5 U.S.C. 5595 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart G;
(e) Advances in pay under 5 U.S.C. 5524a and 5 CFR part 550, subpart B;
(f) Post differentials under 5 U.S.C. 5925(a) and danger pay allowances under 5 U.S.C. 5928 for an employee temporarily working in a foreign area
when the employee's official worksite is located in a locality pay area;
(g) Nonforeign area cost-of-living allowances and post differentials under 5 U.S.C. 5941 and 5 CFR part 591, subpart B;
(h) Recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives, supervisory differentials, and extended assignment incentives under 5 U.S.C. chapter 57, subchapter IV, and 5 CFR part 575;
(i) Performance-based cash awards under 5 U.S.C. 4505a and 5 CFR part 451, subpart A, when such awards are computed as a percentage of an employee's rate of basic pay;
(j) GS pay administration provisions (e.g., GS promotion provisions) to the extent provided in subpart B of this part;
(k) Pay administration provisions for prevailing rate employees which consider rates of basic pay under the GS pay system in setting pay (except as otherwise provided in 5 CFR part 532), subject to the requirement that, if the employee's actual locality rate would not apply at the official worksite for the prevailing rate position, that locality rate must be converted to a corresponding rate on the locality rate schedule for that official worksite;
(l) Lump-sum payments under 5 CFR part 550, subpart L, for accumulated and accrued annual leave;
(m) Grade and pay retention under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter VI, to the extent provided by 5 CFR part 536;
(n) Other provisions as specified in other statute or OPM regulations; and
(o) Payments or benefits equivalent to those listed in this section under other legal authority, as determined by the head of the agency or other authorized official responsible for administering such payments or benefits.
[70 FR 31304, May 31, 2005, as amended at 70 FR 74996, Dec. 19, 2005; 73 FR 66154, Nov. 7, 2008; 76 FR 68634, Nov. 7, 2011]
§ 531.611
Miscellaneous provisions.
(a) A locality rate may be paid only for those hours for which an employee is in a pay status.
(b) Payment of, or an increase in, a locality rate is not an equivalent increase in pay within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 5335. (
See
§ 531.407(c).)
(c) A locality rate is included in an employee's
total remuneration,
as defined in 5 CFR 551.511(b), and
straight time rate of pay,
as defined in 5 CFR 551.512(b), for the purpose of overtime pay computations under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.
(d) Consistent with § 531.610, a reduction or termination of a locality rate under § 531.609 is not an adverse action for the purpose of 5 CFR part 752, subpart D, or an action under 5 CFR 930.211.

(d) The step 2 or payline rate for each grade of an appropriated fund supervisory regular wage schedule shall be:
(1) For grades WS-1 through WS-10, equal to the rate for step 2 of the corresponding grade of the nonsupervisory regular wage schedule for the area,
plus 30 percent of the rate for step 2 of WG-10;
(2) For grades WS-11 through WS-18, the second rate of WS-10, plus 5, 11.5, 19.6, 29.2, 40.3, 52.9, 67.1, and 82.8 percent, respectively, of the difference between the step 2 rates of WS-10 and WS-19; and
(3) For grade WS-19, the third rate in effect for General Schedule grade GS-14 at the time of the area wage schedule adjustment. The WS-19 rate shall include any cost of living allowance payable for the area under 5 U.S.C. 5941.
(e) The step 2 or payline rate for each grade of a nonappropriated fund supervisory regular wage schedule shall be:

§ 532.205
The use of Federal, State, and local minimum wage requirements in determining prevailing rates.
(a) Wage schedules, including special schedules, shall not include any rates of pay less than the higher of:
(1) The minimum rate prescribed by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, or
(2) The highest State or local minimum wage rate in the local wage area which is applicable to the private industry counterparts of the single largest Federal industry/occupation in the wage area.
(b) Wage data below the minimum wage rates prescribed by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, shall not be used in determining prevailing rates.
(c) Adjustments to regular wage schedules to comply with the minimum wage rate determined to be applicable under paragraph (a) of this section shall be computed as follows:
(1) The step 2 rate of grade 1 of the nonsupervisory wage schedule shall be set at a rate which, upon application of the 4 percent step-rate differential, provides a step 1 rate which is equal to the applicable minimum wage rate.
(2) An intergrade differential shall be determined as 5 percent of the rate established as the step 2 rate of grade 1, rounded to the nearest whole cent. This intergrade differential shall be added to the step 2 rate of each grade, beginning with grade 1, to determine the step 2 rate for the succeeding grade until the grade is reached at which the step 2 rate established through the wage survey process equals or exceeds the rate determined under this procedure. Rates of all grades above that point shall be computed in accordance with § 532.221(b) of this subpart.
(3) Steps 1, 3, 4, and 5 of each grade adjusted under paragraph (c) of this section shall be set at 96, 104, 108, and 112 percent of the step 2 rate, respectively.
(4) The leader and supervisory wage schedule grades corresponding to each nonsupervisory grade adjusted under paragraph (c) of this section shall be constructed in accordance with the procedures of § 532.203 of this subpart,
on the basis of the step 2 rates established under this paragraph for the nonsupervisory wage schedule grades.
(d) All wage schedule adjustments made under this section shall be effective on the effective date of the applicable minimum wage rate.
§ 532.207
Time schedule for wage surveys.
(a) Wage surveys shall be conducted on a 2-year cycle at annual intervals.
(b) A full-scale survey shall be made in the first year of the 2-year cycle and shall include development of a current sample of establishments and the collection of wage data by visits to establishments. With the unanimous consent of the members of a Local Wage Survey Committee, data may also be obtained from a private sector establishment or establishments during a full-scale wage survey by telephone, mail, or electronic means.
(c) A wage-change survey shall be made every other year using only the same employers, occupations, survey jobs, and establishment weights used in the preceding full-scale survey. Data may be collected by telephone, mail, electronic means, or personal contact.
(d) Scheduling of surveys shall take into consideration the following criteria:
(1) The best timing in relation to wage adjustments in the principal local private enterprise establishments;
(2) Reasonable distribution of workload of the lead agency;
(3) The timing of surveys for nearby or selected wage areas; and

§ 532.209
Lead agency.
(a) The Office of Personnel Management shall select a lead agency for each appropriated and nonappropriated fund wage area based on the number of agency employees covered by the regular wage schedule for that area and the capability of the agency in providing administrative and clerical support at the local level necessary to conduct a wage survey.

[55 FR 46141, Nov. 1, 1990]
§ 532.211
Criteria for establishing appropriated fund wage areas.
(a) Each wage area shall consist of one or more survey areas along with nonsurvey areas, if any.
(1)
Survey area:
A survey area is composed of the counties, parishes, cities, or townships in which survey data are collected. Except in very unusual circumstances, a wage area that includes a Metropolitan Statistical Area shall have the Metropolitan Statistical Area as the survey area or part of the survey area.
(2)
Nonsurvey area:
Nonsurvey counties, parishes, cities, or townships may be combined with the survey area(s) to form the wage area through consideration of the criteria in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(b) Wage areas shall include wherever possible a recognized economic community such as a Metropolitan Statistical Area or a political unit such as a county. Two or more economic communities or political units, or both, may be combined to constitute a single wage area; however, except in unusual circumstances and as an exception to the criteria, an individually defined
Metropolitan Statistical Area or county shall not be subdivided for the purpose of defining a wage area.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, wage areas shall be established when:
(1) There is a minimum of 100 wage employees of one agency subject to the regular schedule and the agency involved indicates that its local installation has the capacity to do the survey; and
(2) There is, within a reasonable commuting distance of the concentration of Federal employment;
(i) A minimum of either 20 establishments within survey specifications having at least 50 employees each; or 10 establishments having at least 50 employees each, with a combined total of 1,500 employees; and
(ii) The total private enterprise employment in the industries surveyed in the survey area is at least twice the Federal wage employment in the survey area.
(d)(1) Adjacent economic communities or political units meeting the separate wage area criteria in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be combined through consideration of:
(i) Distance, transportation facilities, and geographic features;
(ii) Commuting patterns; and
(iii) Similarities in overall population, employment, and the kinds and sizes of private industrial establishments.
(2) Generally, the criteria listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section are considered in the order listed.
(3) When two wage areas are combined, the survey area of either or both may be used, depending on the concentrations of Federal and private employment and locations of establishments, the proximity of the survey areas to each other, and the extent of economic similarites or differences as indicated by relative levels of wage rates in each of the potential survey areas.
(e) Appropriated fund wage and survey area definitions are set out as appendix C to this subpart and are incorporated in and made part of this section.
(f) A single contiguous military installation defined as a Joint Base that would otherwise overlap two separate wage areas shall be included in only a single wage area. The wage area of such a Joint Base shall be defined to be the wage area with the most favorable payline based on an analysis of the simple average of the 15 nonsupervisory second step rates on each one of the regular wage schedules applicable in the otherwise overlapped wage areas.

(2) The wage survey data collected in a nonappropriated fund wage survey are adequate if the unweighted job matches include at least two survey jobs in the NA-01 through 04 range providing 10 samples each, one survey job in the NA-01 through 04 range and three survey jobs in the NA-05 through 15 range providing five samples each; two other survey jobs, each providing at least five samples, and at least 100 unweighted samples for all survey jobs combined are used in the computation of the final payline.
(c)(1) If the wage survey data do not meet the adequacy criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, the lead agency shall analyze the data, construct lines and wage schedules, submit them to the agency wage committee for its review and recommendations and issue wage schedules, in accordance with the requirements of this subpart, as if the adequacy criteria were met.
(2) The lead agency may determine such a wage area to be adequate if the quantity of data obtained is large enough to construct paylines even though it was obtained for fewer than the prescribed number of jobs, or at different grade levels, or in different combinations than prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.
(3) The lead agency may not determine a nonappropriated fund wage area to be adequate if fewer than 100 usable unweighted job matches were used in the final payline computation.
(d) If the lead agency determines a wage area to be inadequate under paragraph (c) of this section, it shall promptly refer the problem to OPM for resolution. OPM shall:
(1) Authorize the lead agency to continue to survey the area if the lead agency believes the survey is likely to be adequate in the next full-scale survey;
(2) Authorize the lead agency to expand the scope of the survey; or
(3) Abolish the wage area and establish it as part of one or more other wage areas.

§ 532.241
Analysis of usable wage survey data.
(a)(1) The lead agency shall compute a weighted average rate for each appropriated fund survey job having at least 10 unweighed matches and for each nonappropriated fund job having at least 5 unweighed matches. The weighted average rates shall be computed using the survey job data collected in accordance with §§ 532.235 and 532.247 and the establishment weight.
(2)(i) Incentive and piece-work rates shall be excluded when computing weighted average rates if, after establishment weights have been applied, 90 percent or more of the total usable wage survey data reflect rates paid on a straight-time basis only.
(ii) When sufficient incentive and piece-work rate data are obtained, the full incentive rate shall be used in computing the job weighted average rate when it is equal to or less than the average nonincentive rate. If the full incentive rate is greater than the average nonincentive rate, the incentive rate shall be discounted by 15 percent. The discounted incentive rate shall be compared with the guaranteed minimum rate and the average nonincentive rate, and the highest rate shall be used in computing the job weighted average rate.
(b) The lead agency shall compute paylines using the weighted average rates computed under paragraph (a) of this section.
(1) The lead agency shall compute unit and frequency paylines using the straight-line, least squares regression formula: Y = a + bx, where Y is the hourly rate, x is grade, a is the intercept of the payline with the Y-axis, and b is the slope of the payline.
(i) The unit payline shall be computed using a weight of one for each of the usable survey jobs and the weighted average rates identified and computed under paragraph (a) of this section.
(ii) The frequency payline shall be computed using a weight equal to the number of weighted matches for each of the usable survey jobs and the weighted average rates identified and computed under paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) Either or both of the lines computed according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be recomputed after eliminating survey job data that cause distortion in the lines.
(3) The lead agency may compute midpoint paylines using the following formula: Y = (a
u
+ a
f
)/2 + ((b
u
+ b
f
)/2)x, where Y is the hourly rate, x is the grade, a
u
is the intercept of the unit payline, a
f
is the intercept of the frequency payline, b
u
is the slope of the unit payline, and b
f
is the slope of the frequency payline. A midpoint line may be computed using the paylines based on all of the usable survey job data as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and a second midpoint line may be computed using the paylines based on limited survey job data authorized in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4) The lead agency may compute other paylines for the purpose of instituting changes in the scope of the survey.
(c) Usable data obtained from a particular establishment may not be modified or deleted in order to reduce the effect of an establishment's rates on survey findings,
i.e.,
data will not be deleted or modified to avoid establishment domination.

§ 532.249
Minimum rates for hard-to-fill positions.
(a) The lead agency for a wage area may establish the rate of the second, third, fourth, or fifth step of one or more grades of an occupation as the mandatory minimum rate or rates payable by any agency for the occupation at one or more locations within a wage area based on findings that:
(1) The hiring rates prevailing for an occupation in private sector establishments in the wage area are higher than the rate of the first step of the grade or grades of the occupation; and
(2) Federal installations and activities in the wage area are unable to recruit qualified employees at the rate of the first step of the grade or grades of the occupation.
(b) Any authorizations made under paragraph (a) of this section shall be indicated on the regular wage schedule for the wage area.
(c) Any authorizations made under paragraph (a) of this section shall be terminated with the issuance of a new regular wage schedule unless the conditions that warrant the authorizations continue and the new regular wage schedule continues that authorization.
(d) The lead agency, prior to terminating any authorization made under paragraph (a) of this section, shall require the appropriate official or officials at all installations or activities to which the authorization applies to discuss the termination with the appropriate official or officials of exclusively recognized employee organizations representing employees in the affected occupation. The agency officials shall report the results of these discussions to the lead agency.
(e) No employee shall have his/her pay reduced because of cancellation of an authorization made under paragraph (a) of this section.

§ 532.251
Special rates.
(a) A lead agency, with the approval of OPM, may establish special rates for use within all or part of a wage area for a designated occupation or occupational specialization and grade, in lieu of rates on the regular schedule. OPM may authorize special rates to the extent it considers necessary to overcome existing or likely significant handicaps in the recruitment or retention of well-qualified personnel when these handicaps are due to any of the following circumstances:
(1) Rates of pay offered by private sector employers for an occupation or occupational specialization and grade are significantly higher than those paid by the Federal Government within the competitive labor market;
(2) The remoteness of the area or location involved; or
(3) Any other circumstances that OPM considers appropriate.
(b) In authorizing special rates, OPM shall consider—
(1) The number of existing or likely vacant positions and the length of time they have been vacant, including evidence to support the likelihood that a recruitment problem will develop if one does not already exist;
(2) The number of employees who have or are likely to quit, including the number quitting for higher pay positions and evidence to support the likelihood that employees will quit;
(3) The number of vacancies employing agencies tried to fill and the number of hires and offers made;
(4) The nature of the existing labor market;
(5) The degree to which employing agencies have considered or used increased minimum rates for hard-to-fill positions;
(6) The degree to which employing agencies have considered relevant non-pay solutions to the staffing problem, such as conducting an aggressive recruiting program, using appropriate appointment authorities, redesigning jobs, establishing training programs, and improving working conditions;
(7) The impact of the staffing problem on employers' missions;
(8) The level of private sector rates paid for comparable positions; and
(9) As appropriate, the extent to which the use of unrestricted rates authorized under § 532.801 of this part was considered.
(c) In determining at what level to set special rates, OPM shall consider—
(1) The level of rates it believes necessary to recruit or retain an adequate number of well-qualified persons;
(2) The offsetting costs that will be incurred if special rates are not authorized; and
(3) The level of private sector rates paid for comparable positions.
(d) No one factor or combination of factors specified in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section requires special rates to be established or to be adjusted to any given level. Each request to establish special rates shall be judged on its own merits, based on the extent to which it meets these factors. Increased minimum rates are not a prerequisite to the establishment of special rates under this section.
(e) Special rates shall be based on private sector wage data, or a percentage thereof, as specified by OPM at the time the special rates are authorized. The private sector data shall be calculated as a weighted average or payline, as appropriate. A single rate shall be used when this represents private sector practice, and five rates shall be used when rate ranges are used by the private sector. When a five-step rate range is used, the differentials between steps shall be set in accordance with § 532.203(f) of this subpart.
(f) Once approved by OPM, special rates may be adjusted by the lead agency on the same cycle as the applicable regular schedule to the extent deemed necessary to ensure the continued recruitment or retention of well-qualified personnel. The amount of the special rate adjustment may be up to the percentage (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) by which the market rate has changed since the last adjustment. Special rates may not exceed the percentage of market rates initially approved by OPM unless a request for higher special rates is made and approved under paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
(g) Any special rates established under paragraph (a) of this section shall be shown on the regular schedule or published as an amendment to the regular schedule and shall indicate the wage area (or part thereof) and each occupation or occupational specialization and grade for which the rates are authorized. These rates shall be paid by all agencies having such positions in the wage area (or part thereof) specified.
(h) The scheduled special rate payable under this section may not, at any time, be less than the unrestricted (uncapped) rate otherwise payable for such positions under the applicable regular wage schedule.
(i) If a special rate is terminated under paragraph (f) of this section, the lead agency shall provide written notice of such termination to OPM.
(j) Employers using special rates shall maintain current recruitment and retention data for all authorized special rates. Such data shall be made available to the lead agency prior to the wage area regular schedule adjustment date for the purpose of determining whether there is a continuing need for special rates and the amount of special rate adjustment necessary to recruit or retain well-qualified employees.

§ 532.253
Special rates or rate ranges for leader, supervisory, and production facilitating positions.
(a) When special rates or rate ranges are established for nonsupervisory positions, a lead agency also shall establish special rates for leader, supervisory, and production facilitating positions, classified to the same occupational series and title, that lead, supervise, or perform production facilitating work directly relating to the nonsupervisory jobs covered by the special rates.
(b) The step rate structure shall be the same as that of the related nonsupervisory special rate or rate range.
(c) The following formulas shall be used to establish a special rate or rate range:
(1) A single rate shall equal the top step of the appropriate leader, supervisory, or production facilitating grade on the regular schedule, plus the cents per hour difference between the top step of the appropriate nonsupervisory
grade on the regular schedule and the special nonsupervisory rate.
(2) For a multiple rate range, the step 2 rate shall equal the step 2 rate of the appropriate leader, supervisory, or production facilitating grade on the regular schedule, plus the cents per hour difference between the prevailing rate of the appropriate nonsupervisory grade on the regular schedule and the prevailing rate of the special rate position. Other required step rates shall be computed in accordance with the formula established in § 532.203 of this subpart.

§ 532.254
Special schedules.
(a) A lead agency, with the approval of OPM, may establish special schedules for use within an area for specific occupations that are critical to the mission of a Federal activity based on findings that—
(1) Unusual prevailing pay practices exist in the private sector that are incompatible with regular schedule practices, and serious recruitment or retention problems exist or will likely develop if employees are paid from the authorized regular schedule; or
(2) Administrative considerations require the establishment of special schedules to address unique agency missions or other unusual circumstances that OPM considers appropriate.
(b) An OPM authorization for a special schedule shall include instructions for its construction, application, and administration.
(c) Unless otherwise specified, positions covered by special schedules shall be subject to the general provisions of this part and to other applicable rules and regulations of OPM.

Special wage schedules for apprentices and shop trainees.
(a) Agencies may establish special wage schedules for apprentices and shop trainees who are included in:
(1) Formal apprenticeship programs involving training for journeyman level duties in occupations that are recognized as apprenticeable by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, U.S. Department of Labor; or
(2) Formal shop trainee programs involving training for journeyman level duties in nonapprenticeable occupations that require specialized trade or craft skill and knowledge.
(b) Special schedules shall consist of a single wage rate for each training period. Wage rates shall be determined as follows:
(1) Rates shall be based on the current second step rate of the target journeyman grade level on the regular nonsupervisory wage schedule for the area where the apprentice or trainee is employed.
(2) The entrance rate shall be computed at 65 percent of the journeyman level, step 2, rate, or the WG-1, step 1, rate, whichever is greater.
(3) When the WG-1, step 1, rate is used, the apprentice rate shall be increased by a minimum of 5 cents per hour for each succeeding increment interval until the rate obtained by this method equals the rate computed under the formula. No increase shall be less then 5 cents per hour.
(c) Advancement to higher increments shall be at 26-week intervals, regardless of the total length of the training period. Intermediate rates shall be established by subtracting the entrance rate from the journeyman level, step 2 rate, and dividing the difference by the number of 26-week periods of the particular training term. The resulting quotient equals the increment for each succeeding rate.
(d) Agencies may hire at advanced rates or accelerate progression through scheduled wage rates if prescribed by approved agency training standards or programs.
(e) If the employee is promoted to the target job or to a job at the same grade level, the promotion shall be to the second step rate. If the employee is assigned to a job at a grade level that is less than the grade level of the target job, existing pay fixing rules shall be followed.

§ 532.283
Special wage schedules for nonappropriated fund tipped employees classified as waiter/waitress.
(a) Tipped employees shall be paid from the regular nonappropriated fund (NAF) schedule applicable to the employee's duty station.
(b) A tip offset may be authorized for employees classified as Waiter/Waitress. For purposes of this section, a tipped employee is one who is engaged in an occupation in which he or she customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips, and a tip offset is the amount of money by which an employer, in meeting legal minimum wage standards, may reduce a tipped employee's cash wage in consideration of the receipt of tips.
(c) A tip offset may be established, abolished, or adjusted by NAF instrumentalities on an annual basis and at such additional times as new or revised minimum wage statutes require. The amount of any tip offset may vary within a single instrumentality based on location, type of service, or time of service.
(d) If tipped employees are represented by a labor organization holding exclusive recognition, the employing NAF instrumentality shall negotiate with such organization to arrive at a determination as to whether, when, and how much tip offset shall be applied. Changes in tip offset practices may be made more frequently than annually as a result of collective bargaining agreement.
(e) Tip offset practices shall be governed by the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, or the applicable statutes of the State, possession or territory where an employee works, whichever provides the greater benefit to the employee. In locations where tip offset is prohibited by law, the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section do not apply.
[55 FR 46146, Nov. 1, 1990]
§ 532.285
Special wage schedules for supervisors of negotiated rate Bureau of Reclamation employees.
(a) The Department of the Interior shall establish and issue special wage schedules for wage supervisors of negotiated rate wage employees in the Bureau of Reclamation. These schedules shall be based on annual special wage surveys conducted by the Bureau of Reclamation in each special wage area. Survey jobs representing Bureau of Reclamation positions at up to four levels will be matched to private industry jobs in each special wage area. Special schedule rates for each position will be based on prevailing rates for that particular job in private industry.
(b) Each supervisory job shall be described at one of four levels corresponding to the four supervisory situations described in Factor I and four levels of Subfactor IIIA of the FWS Job Grading Standard for Supervisors. They shall be titled in accordance with regular FWS practices, with the added designation of level I, II, III, or IV. The special survey and wage schedule for a given special wage area includes only those occupations and levels having employees in that area. For each position on the special schedule, there shall be three step rates. Step 2 is the prevailing rate as determined by the survey; step 1 is 96 percent of the prevailing rate; and step 3 is 104 percent of the prevailing rate.
(c) For each special wage area, the Bureau of Reclamation shall designate and appoint a special wage survey committee, including a chairperson and two other members (at least one of whom shall be a supervisor paid from the special wage schedule), and one or more two-person data collection teams (each of which shall include at least one supervisor paid from the special wage schedule). The local wage survey committee shall determine the prevailing rate for each survey job as a weighted average. Survey specifications are as follows for all surveys:
(1) Based on Bureau of Reclamation activities and types of supervisory positions in the special wage area, the Bureau of Reclamation must survey private industry companies, with no
minimum employment size requirement for establishments, in the following North American Industry Classification System code subsectors:
2022 NAICS codes
2022 NAICS industry titles
211
Oil and gas extraction.
212
Mining (except oil and gas).
213
Support activities for mining.
221
Utilities.
333
Machinery manufacturing.
334
Computer and electronic product manufacturing.
335
Electrical equipment, appliance, and component manufacturing.
484
Truck transportation.
492
Couriers and messengers.
493
Warehousing and storage.
516
Broadcasting and content providers.
517
Telecommunications.
562
Waste management and remediation services.
811
Repair and maintenance.
(2) Each local wage survey committee shall compile lists of all companies in the survey area known to have potential job matches. For the first survey, all companies on the list will be surveyed. Subsequently, companies shall be removed from the survey list if they prove not to have job matches, and new companies will be added if they are expected to have job matches. Survey data will be shared with other local wage survey committees when the data from any one company is applicable to more than one special wage area.
(3) For each area, survey job descriptions shall be tailored to correspond to the position of each covered supervisor in that area. They will be described at one of four levels (I, II, III, or IV) corresponding to the definitions of the four supervisory situations described in Factor I and four levels of Subfactor IIIA of the FWS Job Grading Standard for Supervisors. A description of the craft, trade, or labor work supervised will be included in each supervisory survey job description.
(d) Special wage area boundaries shall be identical to the survey areas covered by the special wage surveys. The areas of application in which the special schedules will be paid are generally smaller than the survey areas, reflecting actual Bureau of Reclamation worksites and the often scattered location of surveyable private sector jobs. Special wage schedules shall be established in the following areas:

Pt. 532, Subpt. B, App. C

# Appendix C to Subpart B of Part 532—Appropriated Fund Wage and Survey Areas
This appendix lists the wage area definitions for appropriated fund employees. With a few exceptions, each area is defined in terms of county units, independent cities, or, in the New England States, of entire township or city units. Each wage area definition consists of:
(1)
Wage area title.
Wage areas usually carry the title of the principal city in the area. Sometimes, however, the area title reflects a broader geographic area, such as Wyoming or Eastern Tennessee.
(2)
Survey area definition.
Lists each county, independent city, or township in the survey area.
(3)
Area of application definition.
Lists each county, independent city, or township which, in addition to the survey area, is in the area of application.

# Subpart C—Determining Rates for Principal Types of Positions
§ 532.301
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart:
Nearest similar wage area
means the nearest wage area which is most similar to the local wage area in terms of private employment, population, relative numbers of private employers in major industry categories, and kinds and sizes of industry establishments and in which adequate private establishments exist in the survey area whose activities are similar to those in the dominant industry.
Principal types of appropriated or nonappropriated fund positions
means those groups of occupations which require work of a specialized nature and which are peculiar to a specific Government industry which is the dominant industry among the total wage employment in the wage area.
Specialized private industry
means private industry establishments in those industry groups, comparable to the specialized Government industries listed in § 532.303 of this section, which must be included in a wage survey in order to obtain data comparable to a dominant industry.
§ 532.303
Specialized industry.
(a)(1) Under the appropriated fund wage system, a “specialized industry” is a Federal activity engaged in the production or repair of aircraft, ammunition, artillery and combat vehicles, communication equipment, electronic equipment, guided missiles, heavy duty equipment, shipbuilding, sighting and fire control equipment, or small arms.
(2) Under the nonappropriated fund wage system a “specialized industry” includes only nonappropriated fund operated eating and drinking places. Additional industries may be considered as specialized industries upon approval of the Office of Personnel Management.
§ 532.305
Dominant industry.
(a)(1) A specialized industry is a “dominant industry” if the number of wage employees in the wage area who are subject to the wage schedule for which the survey is made and employed in occupations which comprise the principal types of appropriated or nonappropriated fund positions in the specialized industry comprise:
(i) For appropriated fund activities,
(A) At least 25 percent of the total wage employment or
(B) 1,000 or more employees in a wage area having more than 4,000 wage employees; and
(ii) For nonappropriated fund activities
(A) At least 25 percent of the total wage employment or
(B) 100 or more wage employees in a wage area having 400 or more wage employees.
(2) If two or more specialized industries in a wage area qualify as dominant industries, the two specialized industries having the largest number of wage employees shall be the dominant industries for purposes of applying the requirements of this subpart.
§ 532.307
Determinating whether a dominant industry exists in a wage area.
(a) The chairperson of the local wage survey committee shall, before a full-scale wage survey is scheduled to begin, notify all appropriated or nonappropriated fund activities having employees subject to the wage schedules for which the survey is conducted so that organizations and individuals may submit written recommendations and supporting evidence to the local wage survey committee concerning principal types of appropriated or nonappropriated fund positions in the area. Each appropriated or nonappropriated fund activity shall publicize the opportunity to make such recommendations.
(b)(1) Before conducting a full-scale wage survey an occupational inventory of employees subject to the wage schedules for which the survey is conducted shall be obtained from each appropriated or nonappropriated fund activity in the area having such employees.
(2) After reviewing the occupational inventory and considering the recommendations received pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the local wage survey committee shall formulate its recommendations and prepare a written report concerning the existence of specialized industries within the wage area.
(3) The report of the recommendations, the occupational inventory, and the recommendations and supporting evidence received pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be forwarded to the lead agency.
(c) The lead agency shall refer the occupational inventory and the reports received pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section to the agency wage committee for its consideration and recommendation if:
(1) The lead agency proposes not to accept the recommendation of the local wage survey committee concerning the specifications of the local wage survey; or
(2) The local wage survey committee's report is accompanied by a minority report.
(d) The lead agency shall determine, in writing, after taking into consideration the reports and recommendations received under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and prior to ordering a full-scale wage survey to begin, whether the principal types of appropriated or nonappropriated fund positions in a local wage area comprise a dominant industry. The determination shall remain in effect until the next full-scale wage survey in the area.
[46 FR 21344, Apr. 10, 1981, as amended at 55 FR 46179, Nov. 1, 1990]
§ 532.309
Determining adequacy of specialized private industry.
(a) Specialized private industry comparable to an appropriated fund dominant industry is adequate when:
(1) The survey area is one of the 25 largest Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas, or the total number of employees of private industry establishments in the specialized private industry located in the survey area is at least equal to the total number of appropriated fund wage employees in occupations which comprise the principal types of appropriated positions in the dominant industry who are subject to the wage schedules for which the survey is made; or
(2) For any dominant industry except “ammunition,” the job matches obtained from the specialized private industry include one regular survey job in the WG-01 through 04 range, one regular survey job in the WG-05 through 08 range, one regular survey job in the WG-09 and above range, and one special survey job in the WG-09 and above range all providing at least 20 unweighted samples each; and three other regular or special survey jobs, each providing at least 10 unweighted samples.
(3) For the dominant industry “ammunition,” the job matches obtained from the specialized survey industries include one regular survey job in the WG-01 through 04 range, one special survey job in the WG-05 through 08 range, and one regular survey job in the WG-09 through 15 range, all providing at least 20 unweighted samples each; and three other regular or special survey jobs, each providing at least 10 unweighted samples.
(b) Specialized private industry comparable to a nonappropriated fund dominant industry is adequate when:
(1) The total number of employees of private industry establishments similar to the dominant industry located in the survey are at least equal to the number of nonappropriated fund wage employees in positions which comprise the principal types of nonappropriated fund positions in the dominant industry who are subject to the wage schedules for which the survey is made; and
(2) The job matches obtained from all industries surveyed for regular survey jobs related to the dominant industry include one regular survey job in the NA-01 through 04 range providing at least 10 samples; and one regular survey job in the NA-05 through 15 range and one other regular survey job, each providing at least five samples.
§ 532.311
Survey of specialized private industry related to a dominant industry.
If it is determined that there are one or more dominant industries within a wage area, the lead agency shall insure that the survey includes the industries and survey jobs related to the dominant industries. When the related industry within the local wage survey area fails to meet the criteria in § 532.309 of this subpart, the lead agency shall obtain data related to the dominant industry from the survey area of the wage area which is determined to be the nearest similar area which will
provide adequate data under the criteria in § 532.309 of this subpart.
[46 FR 21344, Apr. 10, 1981, as amended at 55 FR 46179, Nov. 1, 1990]

[55 FR 46180, Nov. 1, 1990]
§ 532.317
Use of data from the nearest similar area.
(a)(1) For prevailing rate employees other than those in the Department of Defense, the lead agency shall, in establishing the regular schedule under the provisions of this subpart, analyze and use the acceptable data from the nearest similar wage area together with the data obtained from inside the local wage survey area. The regular schedule for Department of Defense prevailing rate employees shall be based on local wage data only.
(2) The total number of job matches obtained from the nearest similar wage area shall be equal to the number required for adequacy in § 532.309(a) (2) and (3) of this subpart for appropriated fund surveys and § 532.309(b)(2) of this subpart for nonappropriated fund surveys.
(3) Data shall be selected for inclusion on the basis of the most populous survey jobs as determined by the weighted job matches found in the dominant industry in the selected reference area. In identifying survey jobs for which reference area samples will be included, the jobs required at limited grade ranges shall be selected before jobs in the unlimited grade range. When there is a tie in the selection procedure, the highest graded job shall be selected first.
(4) If there are two dominant industries for which data are obtained from nearest similar areas, the procedure described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be applied independently for each of the specialized industries.
(b)(1) The wage rates established for a grade by using data from the nearest similar area may not exceed the wage rates for the same grade in the nearest similar area.
(2) If data are obtained from two nearest similar areas for two dominant industries, the wage rates established for a grade by using these data may not exceed the higher of the wage rates for the same grade in the two nearest similar areas.
(c) The wage data obtained from the nearest similar area or areas may not be used to reduce the wage rates for any grade in the local area below the rates that would be established for that grade without the use of the data from the nearest similar area or areas.

# Subpart D—Pay Administration
§ 532.401
Definitions.
In this subpart:
Change to lower grade
means a change in the position of an employee who, while continuously employed—
(1) Moves from a position in one grade of a prevailing rate schedule established under this part to a position in a lower grade of the same type prevailing rate schedule, whether in the same or different wage area;
(2) Moves from a position under a prevailing rate schedule established under this part to a position under a different prevailing rate schedule (e.g., WL to WG) with a lower representative rate; or
(3) Moves from a position not under a prevailing rate schedule to a position with a lower representative rate under a prevailing rate schedule.
Equivalent increase
means an increase or increases in an employee's rate of basic pay equal to or greater than the difference between the rate of pay for the grade and step occupied by the employee and the rate of pay for the next higher step of that grade, except in the situations specified in § 532.417 of this subpart. In the case of a promotion, the grade and step occupied means the grade and step to which promoted.
Existing scheduled rate of pay
means the scheduled rate of pay received immediately before the effective date of a transfer, reassignment, promotion, change to a lower grade, within-grade increase, or revision of a wage schedule.
Highest previous rate
means the highest scheduled rate of pay previously paid to a person while employed in a job in any branch of the Federal Government, a mixed-ownership corporation, or the government of the District of Columbia. It is based on a regular tour of duty under an appointment not limited to 90 days or less, or for a continuous period of no less than 90 days under one or more appointments without a break in service.
Promotion
means a change in the position of an employee who, while continuously employed—
(1) Moves from a position in one grade of a prevailing rate schedule established under this part to a position in a higher grade of the same type prevailing rate schedule, whether in the same or different wage area;
(2) Moves from a position under a prevailing rate schedule established under this part to a position under a different prevailing rate schedule (e.g., WG to WL) with a higher representative rate; or
(3) Moves from a position not under a prevailing rate schedule to a position with a higher representative rate under a prevailing rate schedule.
Rate of basic pay
means the scheduled rate of pay plus any night or environmental differential.
Reassignment
means a change of an employee, while serving continuously in the same agency, from one job to another without promotion or change to a lower grade.
Representative rate
means the going rate,
i.e.,
the rate or step keyed to the prevailing rate determination. For example:
(1) The established rate on a single rate schedule;
(2) The second rate on a five-rate regular wage schedule;
(3) The fourth rate on the General Schedule; or
(4) The fourth rate of a class under the Foreign Service Officer and Foreign Service Staff schedule.
Retained rate
means the rate of pay an employee is receiving which is higher than the maximum scheduled rate of pay of the Federal Wage System grade or pay level to which the employee is assigned.
Scheduled rate of pay
means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action, including a retained rate of pay, for the job held by an employee before any deductions and exclusive of additional pay of any kind.
[46 FR 21344, Apr. 10, 1981, as amended at 55 FR 46180, Nov. 1, 1990; 60 FR 62701, Dec. 7, 1995]
§ 532.403
New appointments.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a new appointment to a position shall be made at the minimum rate of the appropriate grade.
(b) An agency may make a new appointment at a rate above the minimum rate of the appropriate grade in recognition of an appointees' special qualifications. In determining the rate at which to set the appointee's pay:
(1) An agency must consider how the step has been set for employees who had similar qualifications (based on the level, type, or quality of the appointee's skills or competencies or other qualities and experiences) and who have been newly appointed to positions that are similar to the appointee's position (based on the position's occupational series, grade level, organization, geographic location, or other job-relevant factors), if applicable;
(2) An agency may not consider the appointee's pay history (
i.e.,
existing pay or prior pay) or a pay rate from a competing job offer; and
(3) An agency must consider other relevant factors (e.g., the level, type, or quality of the appointee's skills or competencies; or significant disparities between Federal and non-Federal salaries for the skills and competencies required in the position to be filled).
(c) An agency shall make a new appointment at a step-rate above the minimum rate of a grade if the lead agency for the wage area has designated, in accordance with § 532.249, a step-rate above the first step-rate of a
grade as the minimum step-rate at which a position may be filled.
[46 FR 21344, Apr. 10, 1981, as amended at 58 FR 32274, June 9, 1993; 89 FR 5755, Jan. 30, 2024]
§ 532.405
Use of highest previous rate.
(a)(1) Subject to the provisions of § 532.407 of this subpart and part 536 of this chapter, when an employee is reemployed, reassigned, transferred, promoted, or changed to a lower grade, the agency may fix the pay at any rate of the new grade which does not exceed the employee's highest previous rate.
(2) However, if the employee's highest previous rate falls between two step-rates of the new grade, the agency may fix the pay at the higher of the two.
(b)(1) When an employee's type of appointment is changed in the same job, an agency may continue to pay the existing scheduled rate or may pay any higher rate of the grade which does not exceed the employee's highest previous rate.
(2) However, if the highest previous rate falls between two step rates of the grade, the agency may pay the higher rate.
(c)(1) The highest previous rate, if earned in a wage job, is the current rate of the grade and step-rate of the former job on the same type of wage schedule in the wage area in which the employee is being employed, or the actual earned rate, whichever is higher.
(2) If earned on a General Schedule or another pay system other than the Federal Wage System, it is the current rate for the same grade and rate of that schedule.
(d) The highest previous rate may be based upon a rate of pay received during a temporary promotion, so long as the temporary promotion is for a period of not less than 1 year. This limitation does not apply upon permanent placement in a position at the same or higher grade.

# Subpart F—Job Grading System
§ 532.601
General.
The Office of Personnel Management shall establish a job grading system in accordance with section 5346 of title 5, United States Code. Appropriate instructions to agencies on the application of the job grading system shall be published by the Office of Personnel Management. Agencies are required to grade all jobs subject to this part in accordance with such instructions.

# Subpart G—Job Grading Reviews and Appeals
§ 532.701
General.
A prevailing rate employee may at any time appeal the occupational series, grade, or title to which the employee's job is assigned, but may not appeal under this subpart the standards established for the job, nor other matters such as the accuracy of the job description, the rate of pay, or the propriety of a wage schedule rate. The filing of a job-grading appeal does not negate any other appeal or grievance rights which may be available under applicable law, rule, regulation, or negotiated agreement.
[51 FR 18561, May 21, 1986]
§ 532.703
Agency review.
(a) Each agency shall establish a system processing an employee's application for review of the correctness of the series, grade or title of the employee's job.

# Note:
Application for review will be hereafter referred to as an “application”.
(b) In establishing the system required by this subpart, an agency, as a
minimum, shall provide that the following requisites be met.
(1) The provisions of the system shall be published and the agency's employees shall be informed where a published copy is available for review.
(2) An application shall be in writing and contain the reasons the employee believes the position is erroneously graded.
(3) An application may be filed at any time. However, when the application involves a downgrading or other job-grading action which resulted in a reduction in grade or loss or pay, in order to be entitled to retroactive corrective action, an employee must request a review under the provisions of this subpart within 15 calendar days of the effective date of the change to lower grade.
(4) An employee may select a representative, and the employee and the representative, when the representative is also employed by the same agency, shall be granted a reasonable time in presenting the application and shall be assured freedom from restraint, interference, coercion, or reprisal in presenting the application.
(5) An employee shall promptly furnish such facts as may be requested by the agency.
(6) An application shall be canceled and the employee so notified in the following circumstances:
(i) On receipt of a written request by the employee;
(ii) Failure of the employee to furnish required information or otherwise fail to proceed with the advancement of his application in a timely manner; however, instead of cancellation for failure by the employee to prosecute, the application may be adjudicated by the agency if the information is sufficient for that purpose; or
(iii) On notice that the employee has left the job, except when the employee would be entitled to the retroactive benefits including benefits allowable after the death of an employee appellant.
(7) The application shall be processed and decided promptly. No more than one level of review may be established within an agency before a final decision is issued, and that level of review, when possible, must be above the level of classification authority which classified the position.
(8) When an employee applies for a review of a downgrading or other job-grading action that resulted in a reduction of pay, and the decision of an agency reverses in whole or in part the downgrading or other job-grading action, the effective date of that decision shall be retroactive to the effective date of the action being reviewed when the initial application to the agency was submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. However, when the agency decision raises the grade or level of the job above its grade or level immediately preceding the downgrading, retroactivity shall apply only to the extent of restoration to the grade or level immediately preceding the downgrading.
(9) The right to a retroactive effective date is preserved when an agency finds that an employee was not notified of the applicable time limit for review and was not otherwise aware of the limit or that circumstances beyond the employee's control prevented filing the application within the prescribed time limit.
(10) The effective date of a change in the series, title or grade of a job shall be specified in the agency decision and, unless otherwise required by this subpart, may not be earlier than the date of the decision. However, in no case may it be later than the beginning of the first pay period which begins after the 60th calendar day from the date the application was filed. However, when the agency decision will result in a downgrading or other job-grading action that will reduce the pay of the incumbent of the job, the effective date may not be set earlier than the date on which the decision can be effected in accordance with procedures required by applicable law and regulation. The retroactive reclassification may be based only on duties and responsibilities existing at the time of downgrading or loss of pay and not on duties and responsibilities later assigned.
(11) When an application has been properly filed and the employee dies before the application has been processed, if a favorable decision would entitle the employee to retroactive corrective action, the application will be
processed to completion after the employee's death and any appropriate corrective action made by amending the records of the agency.
(12) The decision on an application shall:
(i) Be based on the record,
(ii) Be in writing,
(iii) Inform the employee either in the decision or as an attachment to the decision of the reasons for the decision, including an analysis of the employee's job,
i.e.,
comparing the job with the appropriate standard, and
(iv) Inform the employee of the right to appeal the decision to the Office of Personnel Management and of the time limits within which the application must be filed.
(c) The agency is responsible for compiling and maintaining a job-grading review file which will constitute the record and which will not contain any document or information which the employee has not been given an opportunity to review.
[46 FR 21344, Apr. 10, 1981, as amended at 51 FR 18561, May 21, 1986]
§ 532.705
Appeal to the Office of Personnel Management.
(a)(1) An employee may appeal the occupation series, grade or title of the job to the appropriate office of the Office of Personnel Management only (i) after the agency has issued a decision under the system established under § 532.703; and (ii) if the employee files the appeal with the Office of Personnel Management within 15 calendar days after receipt of the decision of the agency.
(2) The Office of Personnel Management may extend this time limit if it is shown that the employee was not notified of the applicable time limit and was not otherwise aware of the limit, or that circumstances beyond the employee's control prevented filing an appeal within the prescribed time limit.
(b) An employee shall make the appeal in writing and shall identify specifically the portions of the decision or job analysis of the agency with which the employee disagrees.
(c) The Office of Personnel Management shall base its decision on the record established in the agency, except that when the Office of Personnel Management investigates or audits the job it may take the results of the investigation or audit into consideration. In the event the Office of Personnel Management audits the job, the employee's representative may not be present.
(d) The Office of Personnel Management shall notify the employee and the agency in writing of its decision. The effective date of a change in the series, title and grade of a job directed by the Office of Personnel Management shall be specified in the decision of the Office of Personnel Management, computed from the date the employee filed the application with the agency, and determined under § 532.703(b)(10). However, when the decision will result in a downgrading or other job-grading action that will reduce the pay of the incumbent of the job, the effective date may not be set earlier than the date on which the decision can be effected in accordance with procedures required by applicable law and regulation.
(e) The appeal of an employee shall be canceled and the employee so notified in the following circumstances:
(1) On receipt of the employee's written request;
(2) On failure to prosecute, when the employee does not furnish requested information and duly proceed with the advancement of the appeal; however, instead of cancellation for failure to prosecute, an appeal may be adjudicated if the information is sufficient for that purpose. The Office of Personnel Management may reopen a canceled appeal on a showing that circumstances beyond the control of the employee prevented the employee from prosecuting the appeal; or
(3) On notice that the employee has left the job, except when entitled to retroactive benefits, including benefits allowable after the death of an appellant.
(f) The Office of Personnel Management may, at its discretion, reopen and reconsider any job-grading decision made by the Office when requested by an employee or an agency. This authority may be used under circumstances such as the following:
(1) An employee or an agency presents material facts not previously considered by the Office;
(2) There is room for reasonable doubt as to the appropriateness of the decision; or
(3) The potential impact of a decision on similar jobs is sufficiently significant to make further review of the decision desirable.
(g) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management may, at his or her discretion, reopen and reconsider any previous decision when the party requesting reopening submits written argument or evidence which tends to establish that:
(1) New and material evidence is available that was not readily available when the previous decision was issued;
(2) The previous decision involves an erroneous interpretation of law or regulation or a misapplication of established policy; or
(3) The previous decision is of a precedential nature involving a new or unreviewed policy consideration that may have effects beyond the actual case at hand, or is otherwise of such an exceptional nature as to merit the personal attention of the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.
(h) A final decision by the Office of Personnel Management constitutes a certificate which is mandatory and binding on all administrative, certifying, payroll, disbursing, and accounting officials of the Government.

§ 534.201
General.
Under subchapter V of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code (U.S.C. 5351-5356), agencies may pay stipends and provide certain services to certain student-employees assigned or attached to hospitals, clinics, or medical or dental laboratories operated by agencies. Student-employees covered under the program are excluded from certain provisions of law relating to classification, General Schedule pay, premium pay, leave, and hours of duty. This subpart authorizes the coverage of certain positions under this program and establishes maximum stipends for student-employees in the program.
§ 534.202
Coverage.
In addition to the student-employees specified in 5 U.S.C. 5351(2)(A), the following student-employees are covered under this program, provided they are assigned or attached principally for training purposes to a hospital, clinic, or medical or dental laboratory operated by an agency:
(1) Any student-employee whom an agency finds is properly covered under this program, provided that the student-employee is a registered student at an accredited academic institution and that the assignment or attachment
for training purposes to the hospital, clinic, or medical or dental laboratory is a part of a medical or dental training program accredited by an appropriate accrediting body;
(2) Any student-employee whom an agency finds is properly covered under this program, provided that the student-employee, during the period of assignment or attachment to the hospital, clinic, or medical or dental laboratory, will receive experience or training that is required to obtain a certificate or license in a medical or dental field; or
(3) Any student-employee not otherwise covered under this program whom the Office of Personnel Management approves for coverage as a student-employee under this program.

(c) Maximum stipends for positions in the Public Health Service in which duty requires intimate contact with persons afflicted with leprosy are increased above the rates prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section to the same extent that additional pay is provided by Public Health Service Regulations (42 CFR 22.1) for employees subject to the General Schedule (part 531 of this chapter).
(d) Overtime pay, maintenance allowances, and other payments in money or kind for a student-employee must be considered as part of the student-employee's stipend for the purposes of this section, and therefore, may not be used to cause the stipend to exceed the maximum stipend established under this section.
(e) A trainee at a non-Federal hospital, clinic, or medical or dental laboratory who is assigned to a Federal hospital, clinic, or medical or dental laboratory as an affiliate for a part of his or her training may not receive a stipend from the Federal agency other than any maintenance allowance that is provided.
§ 534.204

§ 534.301
Purpose.
This subpart provides rules for determining the rate of basic pay and locality-adjusted rate of basic pay for employees who are appointed to positions in temporary organizations and compensated under 5 U.S.C. 3161. Such temporary organizations are established by law or Executive order. This subpart does not provide authority to establish other forms of compensation and benefits not authorized by title 5, United States Code, or another specific statutory authority.
[67 FR 63049, Oct. 10, 2002]
§ 534.302
Coverage.
This subpart applies to employees in executive level and staff positions in temporary organizations. Such employees are not subject to the provisions applicable to General Schedule employees covered by chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code.

[69 FR 70362, Dec. 6, 2004]
§ 534.304
Basic pay for staff positions.
(a)(1) Rates of basic pay for staff or other non-executive level positions of temporary organizations may not exceed the maximum rate of basic pay for grade GS-15 of the General Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5332, excluding any locality-based comparability payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304.
(2) In establishing rates of basic pay for staff and other non-executive level positions of temporary organizations, the head of a temporary organization must give consideration to the significance, scope, and technical complexity of the position and the qualifications required for the work involved. The head of a temporary organization must also take into account the rates of pay applicable to Federal employees who have duties that are similar in terms of difficulty and responsibility.
(b) Employees in staff and other non-executive level positions of temporary organizations must be paid locality payments in addition to basic pay in the same manner as employees covered by 5 U.S.C. 5304. Locality-adjusted rates of basic pay may not exceed the locality-adjusted rate of basic pay for grade GS-15 of the General Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5304, for the locality pay area involved (not to exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule).
(c) Notwithstanding the limitations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the rate of basic pay and locality-adjusted rate of basic pay for a senior staff position of a temporary organization may, in a case determined by the head of a temporary organization to be exceptional, exceed the maximum rates established under those paragraphs. However, the higher payable rates may not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule.

(b) Employees of temporary organizations must receive basic pay on an hourly basis.

# Subpart D—Pay and Performance Awards Under the Senior Executive Service

# Source:
54 FR 2987, Jan. 23, 1989, unless otherwise noted.
§ 534.401
Purpose.
This subpart contains the rules for setting and adjusting rates of basic pay and granting performance awards for members of the Senior Executive Service (SES), as provided by 5 U.S.C. 5382, 5383, and 5384. An agency must set and adjust the rate of basic pay for an SES member on the basis of the employee's performance and/or contribution to the agency's performance, as determined by the agency through the administration of its performance management system(s) for senior executives. These regulations must be read in combination with applicable statutes and with the regulations for the approval of an SES performance management system under 5 CFR part 430, subpart C, and certification of an SES performance appraisal system under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D.
[69 FR 70362, Dec. 6, 2004]
§ 534.402
Definitions.
In this subpart—
Agency
means an executive agency or military department, as defined by 5 U.S.C. 105 and 102.
Authorized agency official
means the head of an agency or an official who is authorized to act for the head of the agency in the matter concerned. The agency's Inspector General is the
authorized agency official
for senior executive positions in the Office of the Inspector General, consistent with the requirements in section 3(a) of the Inspector General Act of 1978.
Outstanding performance
means performance that substantially exceeds the normally high performance expected of any senior executive, as evidenced by exceptional accomplishments or contributions to the agency's performance.
Performance expectations
means the critical and other performance elements and performance requirements that constitute the senior executive performance plans (as defined in § 430.303).
PRB
means Performance Review Board, as described in § 430.310.
Rate of basic pay
means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the senior executive, within the established SES rate range or, in the case of a senior executive entitled to pay retention, the employee's retained rate of pay, excluding any applicable locality-based comparability payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304, but before any deductions and exclusive of additional pay of any other kind.
Relative performance
means the performance of a senior executive with respect to the performance of other senior executives, including their contribution to agency performance, where appropriate, as determined by the application of a certified performance appraisal system under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D.
Senior executive
means a member of the Senior Executive Service (SES) paid under 5 U.S.C. 5383.
SES rate
means a rate of basic pay within the SES rate range assigned to a member of the SES under § 534.403(a).
SES rate range
means the range of rates of basic pay established for the SES under 5 U.S.C. 5382 and § 534.403(a).
[69 FR 70362, Dec. 6, 2004]
§ 534.403
SES rate range.
(a)
SES rate range.
(1) On the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, the minimum rate of basic pay of the SES rate range is set at an amount equal to the minimum rate of basic pay under 5 U.S.C. 5376 for senior-level positions (excluding any locality-based comparability payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304). The minimum rate of basic pay for the SES rate range will increase consistent with any increase in the minimum rate of basic pay for senior-level positions under 5 U.S.C. 5376. An SES member may not receive less than the minimum rate of the SES rate range. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the maximum rate of basic pay of the SES rate range is set at the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. An SES member's rate of basic pay must be set at one of the rates within the SES rate range
based on the senior executive's performance and/or contribution to the agency's performance.
(2) The maximum rate of basic pay of the SES rate range is set at the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule for senior executives in an agency who are covered by a performance appraisal system that makes meaningful distinctions based on relative performance, as certified by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), with concurrence by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under 5 U.S.C. 5307(d) and 5 CFR part 430, subpart D. A senior executive's rate of basic pay may not exceed the maximum rate of the applicable SES rate range, except as provided in § 534.404(h)(2). The applicable maximum rate of basic pay for the SES rate range will increase with any increase in the rate for levels II or III of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5318.
(3) Rates of basic pay higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule but less than or equal to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule generally are reserved for those senior executives who have demonstrated the highest levels of individual performance and/or made the greatest contributions to the agency's performance, as determined by the agency through the administration of its performance appraisal system for senior executives, or, in the case of newly-appointed senior executives, those who possess superior leadership or other competencies, consistent with the agency's strategic human capital plan.
(b)
Suspension of certification of performance appraisal system.
A senior executive whose rate of basic pay is higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule may not suffer a reduction in pay because his or her agency's applicable performance appraisal system certification is suspended under 5 CFR 430.405(h). The senior executive will continue to receive his or her current SES rate and is not eligible for a pay adjustment until the senior executive is assigned to a position that would allow the employee to receive a pay adjustment or until certification of the employing agency's applicable performance appraisal system is reinstated under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D. The SES rate of pay is not considered a retained rate of pay for the purpose of applying 5 U.S.C. 3594 and 5 CFR part 359, subpart G, or 5 U.S.C. 5363 and 5 CFR part 536, subpart C.
[69 FR 70362, Dec. 6, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 31305, May 31, 2005]
§ 534.404
Setting and adjusting pay for senior executives.
(a)
Setting pay upon initial appointment to the SES.
An authorized agency official may set the rate of basic pay of an individual at any rate within the SES rate range upon initial appointment to the SES, subject to the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay in § 534.403(a). Rates of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule but less than or equal to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule generally are reserved for those newly appointed senior executives who possess superior leadership or other competencies, as determined by the agency as part of its strategic human capital plan. In setting a new senior executive's rate of basic pay, an agency must consider the nature and quality of the individual's experience, qualifications, and accomplishments as they relate to the requirements of the SES position, as well as the individual's current responsibilities. When making a first appointment (regardless of tenure) as a civilian employee of the Federal Government, an agency may not consider the individual's salary history (
i.e.,
existing salary or prior salary) or a salary from a competing job offer.
(b)
Adjusting the pay of SES members.
(1) An authorized agency official may adjust (increase or reduce) the rate of basic pay of a senior executive consistent with the agency's plan for setting and adjusting SES rates of basic pay under paragraph (g) of this section.
(2) A senior executive who receives an annual summary rating of outstanding performance must be considered for an annual pay increase, subject to the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay in § 534.403(a).
(3) An agency may provide a pay increase to allow a senior executive to advance his or her relative position within the SES rate range only upon a
determination by the authorized agency official that the senior executive's individual performance and/or contributions to agency performance so warrant. In assessing a senior executive's performance and/or contribution to the agency's performance, the authorized agency official may consider such things as unique skills, qualifications, or competencies that the individual possesses, and their significance to the agency's performance, as well as the senior executive's current responsibilities. Senior executives who demonstrate the highest levels of individual performance and/or make the greatest contributions to the agency's performance, as determined by the agency through the administration of its performance appraisal system, or, in the case of newly-appointed senior executives, those who possess superior leadership or other competencies, as determined by the agency as part of its strategic human capital plan, must receive the highest rates of basic pay or pay adjustments.
(4)(i) On the effective date of an increase in the minimum or maximum rate of basic pay of the SES rate range under § 534.403(a)(1) or (2), an authorized agency official may increase the rate of basic pay of a senior executive who meets or exceeds his or her performance expectations by an amount that does not exceed the amount necessary to maintain the senior executive's relative position in the SES rate range, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(4)(iii) of this section. A pay increase made under this paragraph is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying § 534.404(c).
(ii) A pay increase under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may not be provided to a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is at or below the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule if such an increase would cause the senior executive's rate of basic pay to exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule unless the senior executive has received an annual summary rating of outstanding for the most recently completed appraisal period and the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) has approved the increase in pay.
(iii) A pay increase under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may not be provided to a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule unless the senior executive has received an annual summary rating of outstanding for the most recently completed appraisal period and the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) has approved the increase in pay. However, in the case of a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule and who has been rated below outstanding, but above fully successful, for the most recently completed appraisal period, the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) may approve such a pay increase in limited circumstances, such as for an exceptionally meritorious accomplishment.
(5) A senior executive who receives a summary rating of less than fully successful may not receive an increase in pay for the current appraisal period.
(6) An authorized agency official may reduce the rate of basic pay of a senior executive for performance and/or disciplinary reasons, consistent with the restrictions on reducing the rate of basic pay of a career senior executive in paragraph (j) of this section and in § 534.406(b).
(c)
12-month rule.
(1) An authorized agency official may adjust (
i.e.
, increase or reduce) the rate of basic pay of a senior executive not more than once during any 12-month period. However, an agency may make a determination to provide an additional pay increase under certain conditions as prescribed in paragraph (c)(3) and (4) of this section without regard to whether the senior executive has received a pay adjustment during the previous 12-month period.
(2) The following pay actions are considered pay adjustments for the purpose of applying this paragraph:
(i) The setting of an individual's rate of basic pay upon initial appointment
or reappointment to the SES under paragraphs (a) and (i)(1) of this section and upon reinstatement to the SES under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section; and
(ii) Any adjustment (increase or reduction) in an SES rate of basic pay granted to a senior executive, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(3) The following pay actions are not considered pay adjustments for the purpose of applying this paragraph:
(i) The conversion of senior executives to the new SES pay system under § 534.406 and the conversion of other employees to equivalent senior executive positions;
(ii) A determination by an authorized agency official to make a zero adjustment in pay after reviewing a senior executive's annual summary rating;
(iii) A zero adjustment in pay made during the 12-month period preceding the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, caused by the former limitation on basic pay plus locality-based comparability payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304(g)(2) for a senior executive who was granted an increase in his or her rate of basic pay that did not result in an actual increase in pay;
(iv) A determination to provide an additional pay increase under paragraph (f) of this section when there is an increase in Executive Schedule rates of pay;
(v) [Reserved]
(vi) A determination to provide a pay increase under paragraph (b)(4) of this section to allow a senior executive to maintain his or her relative position in the SES rate range; and
(vii) An increase in pay equivalent to the minimum amount necessary to ensure that a senior executive's rate of basic pay does not fall below the minimum rate of the SES rate range.
(4) An authorized agency official may approve increases in a senior executive's rate of basic pay more than once during a 12-month period if the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) determines that—
(i) The senior executive's exceptionally meritorious accomplishment significantly contributes to the agency's performance;
(ii) A pay increase is necessary to reassign a senior executive to a position with substantially greater scope and responsibility or to recruit a senior executive with superior leadership or other competencies from a position in another agency;
(iii) The retention of the senior executive is critical to the mission of the agency and the senior executive would be likely to leave the agency in the absence of a pay increase; or
(iv) Such action conforms to an otherwise applicable executive appraisal and pay adjustment cycle (e.g., in the case of a senior executive who was appointed to an SES position within the past 12 months or a senior executive who was transferred to an SES position from an agency with a different senior executive appraisal and pay adjustment cycle within the past 12 months).
(5) An authorized agency official must provide written documentation approving an exception under paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Any pay adjustment made as a result of a determination under paragraph (c)(4) of this section is considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying § 534.404(c) and begins a new 12-month period.
(d)
Adjustments in pay prior to certification of applicable performance appraisal system.
An authorized agency official may adjust a senior executive's rate of basic pay converted under § 534.406 on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, or on any date thereafter prior to obtaining certification under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D, but only up to the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. The authorized agency official may provide an increase in pay if warranted under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section and the senior executive is otherwise eligible for such an increase (
i.e.
, he or she did not receive a pay adjustment under § 534.404(c) during the previous 12-month period). An adjustment in pay made under this paragraph is considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying § 534.404(c).
(e)
Adjustments in pay after certification of applicable performance appraisal system.
(1) In the case of an agency that obtains certification of a performance appraisal system for senior executives under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D, an authorized agency official may increase a covered senior executive's rate of basic pay up to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule, consistent with the limitations in § 534.403(a)(3). The authorized agency official may provide an increase in pay if warranted under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section and if the senior executive is otherwise eligible for such an increase (
i.e.
, he or she did not receive a pay adjustment under § 534.404(c) during the previous 12-month period). An adjustment in pay made under this paragraph is considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying § 534.404(c).
(2) [Reserved]
(f)
Effect of increase in Executive Schedule rates of pay.
(1) If there is an additional increase in the rates for the Executive Schedule in a calendar year, and if that increase becomes effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1 (
i.e.
, the date prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 5318), an agency may review any previous determination to adjust the pay of a senior executive that was made effective on or after the effective date of the first increase in the rates for the Executive Schedule to determine whether, and to what extent, an additional pay increase may be warranted for senior executives based on the same criteria used for the previous determination. If the agency determines that an additional pay increase is warranted, that increase must be made effective as of the effective date of the previous pay increase and is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying § 534.404(c).
(2) If there is an increase in the rates of pay for the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5318 after an agency has already granted pay increases to its senior executives following the applicable performance appraisal period, an agency may review any previous determination to increase the pay of a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is equivalent to the rate for level II (if covered under a performance appraisal system that is certified) or level III (if covered under a performance appraisal system that is not certified) when the applicable maximum rate is increased to determine whether, and to what extent, an additional pay increase may be warranted for the senior executive based on the same criteria used for the previous determination. The determination to provide an additional pay increase must be approved and made effective as of the effective date of increases in the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5318 (
i.e.
, the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1). An additional pay increase under this paragraph is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying § 534.404(c).
(g)
Agency plan for setting and adjusting SES rate of basic pay.
Each agency must establish a plan for setting and adjusting the rates of basic pay for SES members. Agencies must provide for transparency in the processes for making pay decisions, while assuring confidentiality. In developing its plan for setting and adjusting SES rates, an agency may consider the senior executive's broad scope of authority and level of responsibility and his or her personal accountability for the success (or failure) of an agency's programs. The agency's plan must require that any decisions to adjust pay must reflect meaningful distinctions among senior executives based on individual performance and/or contribution to agency performance and must include—
(1) The criteria that will be used to set and adjust a senior executive's rate of basic pay to ensure that individual pay rates or pay adjustments, as well as their overall distribution within the SES rate range, reflect meaningful distinctions within a single performance rating level (e.g., the higher the employee's relative performance within a rating level, the higher the pay adjustment) and/or between performance rating levels (e.g., the higher the rating level, the higher the pay adjustment);
(2) The criteria that will be used to set and adjust a senior executive's rate of basic pay at a rate that exceeds the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule if the applicable agency performance appraisal system has been
certified under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D;
(3) The designation of the authorized agency official who has authority to set and adjust SES rates of pay for individual senior executives, subject to the requirement that the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) and (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) must approve any determination to set a senior executive's rate of basic pay higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule and must approve any determination to increase a senior executive's rate of basic pay more than once in any 12-month period; and
(4) The administrative and management controls that will be applied to ensure compliance with applicable statutes, OPM's regulations, the agency's plan, and, where applicable, the certification requirements set forth in 5 CFR 430, subpart D, and the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay in § 534.403(a).
(h)
Setting pay upon transfer.
(1) An authorized agency official may set the pay of a senior executive transferring from another agency at any rate within the SES rate range, subject to the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay in § 534.403(a) and the restrictions on reducing the pay of career senior executives in paragraph (h)(2) of this section (upon transfer to an agency whose applicable performance appraisal system is not certified) and in § 534.406(b) (for 12 months following the effective date of the new SES pay system). If pay is set at the same SES rate the senior executive received in his or her former agency, the action is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying § 534.404(c).
(2) A senior executive whose rate of basic pay is higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule may not suffer a reduction in pay as a result of transferring to an agency where the maximum rate of basic pay for the applicable SES rate range is equal to the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. The senior executive will continue to receive his or her current SES rate and is not eligible for a pay adjustment until the senior executive is assigned to a position that would allow the employee to receive a pay adjustment or the employing agency's applicable performance appraisal system is certified under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D. The SES rate of pay is not considered a retained rate of pay for the purpose of applying 5 U.S.C. 3594 and 5 CFR part 359, subpart G, or 5 U.S.C. 5363 and 5 CFR part 536, subpart C.
(i)
Setting pay following a break in SES service
—(1)
General.
Upon reappointment to the SES, an authorized agency official may set the rate of basic pay of a former senior executive at any rate within the SES rate range, subject to the limitations in § 534.403(a), if there has been a break in SES service of more than 30 days. If there has been a break in SES service of 30 days or less, the senior executive's rate of basic pay may be set at any rate within the SES rate range (without regard to whether the employee received a pay adjustment during the previous 12-month period), but not higher than the senior executive's former SES rate of basic pay. Where there has been a break in service of 30 days or less, the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) and (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) may approve a higher rate than the senior executive's former rate of basic pay, if warranted. Setting a rate of basic pay upon reappointment to the SES is considered a pay adjustment under § 534.404(c). When setting pay upon reappointment to the SES, an agency may not consider the individual's non-Federal salary history (
i.e.,
existing salary or prior salary) or a salary from a competing job offer.
(2)
Reinstatement from a Presidential appointment requiring Senate confirmation.
The following provisions apply to a former career senior executive who is reinstated under 5 CFR 317.703:
(i) If the individual elected to remain subject to the SES pay provisions while serving under a Presidential appointment, his or her SES rate may be adjusted upon reinstatement to the SES, whether in the agency where the individual held the Presidential appointment or in another agency, if at least 12 months have elapsed since the employee's last SES pay adjustment. If fewer than 12 months have elapsed
since the employee's last SES pay adjustment, an authorized agency official may approve an additional pay increase under § 534.404(c)(4) if the additional pay increase is warranted. Any pay adjustment must be made in accordance with paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section and the agency's plan for adjusting SES rates of pay in paragraph (g) of this section.
(ii) If the individual did not elect to remain subject to the SES pay provisions while serving under a Presidential appointment, his or her SES rate may be set upon reinstatement to the SES at any rate within the SES rate range, subject to the limitations in § 534.403(a).
(iii) Setting a rate of basic pay upon reinstatement to the SES under paragraphs (i)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section is considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying § 534.404(c).
(j)
Restrictions on reducing the pay of career senior executives.
(1) An authorized agency official may reduce a career senior executive's SES rate of basic pay by not more than 10 percent for performance or disciplinary reasons, subject to the restriction on reducing the pay of career senior executives in § 534.406(b) or setting pay below the minimum rate of the SES rate range in § 534.403(a).
(2) The SES rate of basic pay of a career senior executive may be reduced without the employee's consent by the senior executive's agency or upon transfer of function to another agency only—
(i) If the senior executive has received a less than fully successful annual summary rating under 5 CFR part 430, subpart C, or has otherwise failed to meet the performance requirements for a critical element as defined in 5 CFR 430.303; or
(ii) As a disciplinary or adverse action resulting from conduct-related activity, including, but not limited to, misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.
(3) Prior to reducing a career senior executive's rate of basic pay, the agency must provide the senior executive with the following:
(i) Written notice of such reduction at least 15 days in advance of its effective date;
(ii) A reasonable period of time, but not less than 7 days, for the senior executive to respond to such notice orally and/or in writing and to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of that response;
(iii) An opportunity to be represented in the matter by an attorney or other representative;
(iv) A written decision and specific reasons for the pay reduction at the earliest practicable date after the senior executive's response, if any; and
(v) An opportunity to request, within 7 days after the date of that decision, reconsideration by the head of the agency, whose determination with respect to that request will be final and not subject to further review.
(4) Reductions in pay under paragraph (j) of this section are not appealable under 5 U.S.C. 7543.
[69 FR 70363, Dec. 6, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 31305, May 31, 2005; 71 FR 38754, July 10, 2006; 79 FR 12357, Mar. 5, 2014; 89 FR 5755, Jan. 30, 2024]
§ 534.405
Performance awards.
(a) This section covers the payment of performance awards to career appointees in the Senior Executive Service (SES).
(1) To be eligible for an award, the individual must have been an SES career appointee as of the end of the performance appraisal period; and the individual's most recent performance rating of record under part 430, subpart C, of this chapter for the appraisal period must have been “Fully Successful” or higher.
(2) Individuals eligible for a performance award include:
(i) A former SES career appointee who elected to retain award eligibility under 5 CFR part 317, subpart H. If the rate of basic pay of the individual is higher than the maximum rate of basic pay for the applicable SES rate range, the maximum rate of that SES rate range is used for crediting the agency award pool under paragraph (b) of this section and the amount the individual may receive under paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii) A reemployed annuitant with an SES career appointment.
(iii) An SES career appointee who is on detail. If the detail is to another
agency, eligibility is in the individual's official employing agency,
i.e.,
the agency from which detailed. If the appointee is on a reimbursable detail, the agency to which the appointee is detailed may reimburse the employing agency for some or all of any award, as agreed upon by the two agencies; but the reimbursement does not affect the award pool for either agency as calculated under paragraph (b) or this section.
(3) When making recommendations on performance awards, more than one-half of the membership of a Performance Review Board must be career SES appointees. The only exception is if OPM has determined under § 430.307(d) of this chapter that the Board does not have to have a majority of career members when making recommendations on performance appraisals of career appointees because there exists an insufficient number of career appointees.
(4) The agency head must consider the recommendations of the Performance Review Board (PRB), but the agency head has the final authority as to who is to receive a performance award and the amount of the award.
(b)(1) The total amount of performance awards paid during a fiscal year by an agency may not exceed the greater of—
(i) Ten percent of the aggregate career SES rates of basic pay for the agency as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the award payments are made; or
(ii) Twenty percent of the average annual rates of basic pay for career SES appointees of the agency as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the award payments are made.
(2) In determining the aggregate career SES rates of basic pay and the average annual rate of basic pay as of the end of FY 2003 for the purpose of applying paragraph (b) of this section, agencies must use the annual rate of basic pay, plus any applicable locality-based comparability payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304 or special geographic pay adjustment established for law enforcement officers under section 404(a) of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-509), which the SES appointees were receiving at the end of FY 2003.
(c) The amount of a performance award paid to an individual career appointee may not be less than 5 percent nor more than 20 percent of the appointee's SES rate of basic pay as of the end of the performance appraisal period.
(d) OPM shall issue guidance concerning the distribution of performance awards within an agency.
(e) Agencies shall submit their distribution of performance awards, the total amount of awards, and the aggregate payroll or average rate of basic pay as computed under paragraph (b) of this section to OPM no later than 14 days after the date the performance awards are approved by the agency. If OPM determines that an agency's payments do not meet the requirements of law or regulations, the agency shall take any corrective action directed by OPM.
(f) Performance awards must be paid in a lump sum except in those instances when it is not possible to pay the full amount because of the applicable aggregate limitation on pay during a calendar year under 5 CFR part 530, subpart B. In that case, any amount in excess of the applicable aggregate limitation must be paid at the beginning of the following calendar year in accordance with 5 CFR part 530, subpart B. The full performance award, however, is charged against the agency bonus pool under § 534.405(b) for the fiscal year in which the initial payment was made.

§ 534.406
Conversion to the SES pay system.
(a) On the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, agencies must convert an existing SES rate of basic pay for a senior executive to an SES rate of
basic pay that is equal to the employee's rate of basic pay, plus any applicable locality-based comparability payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304 which the senior executive was receiving immediately before that date, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The newly converted rate is the senior executive's SES rate of basic pay. An agency's establishment of an SES rate of basic pay for a senior executive under this paragraph is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying § 534.404(c).
(b) An SES member's rate of basic pay, plus any applicable locality-based comparability payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304 to which the employee was entitled on November 24, 2003, may not be reduced for 1 year after the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004. If an SES member's rate of basic pay, plus any applicable locality-based comparability payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304 to which the employee was entitled on November 23, 2003, is higher than the rate in effect immediately prior to the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, the agency must use the higher rate for the purpose of converting SES members to the SES pay system.
(c) An SES member who is assigned to a position outside the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia to a position overseas or in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or other U.S. territories and possessions as of the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, will be converted to a new rate of basic pay that equals the senior executive's current rate of basic pay, plus the amount of locality pay authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5304 for the applicable locality pay area upon the employee's initial reassignment to a position in the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia. The adjustment will be prospective, not retroactive, and it will not be considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying § 534.404(c). If the senior executive's rate of basic pay did not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule while assigned to a position outside the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia, upon initial reassignment to a locality pay area the senior executive's converted rate of basic pay may not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. The newly converted rate is the senior executive's SES rate of basic pay.
(d) On the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, a law enforcement officer (LEO), as defined in 5 CFR 531.301, who is a member of the SES will have his or her rate of basic pay, plus any applicable special geographic pay adjustment established for LEOs under section 404(a) of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-509) to which he or she was entitled immediately before that date, converted to a new SES rate of basic pay. The newly converted rate is the senior executive's SES rate of basic pay, and any pay adjustments approved on or after January 11, 2004, must be computed based on the senior executive's converted rate of basic pay. Conversion to a new SES rate of basic pay is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying § 534.404(c).
[69 FR 70366, Dec. 6, 2004]
§ 534.407
Pay computation and aggregate compensation.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, pay for members of the SES must be computed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5504(b).
(b) To determine the hourly rate of pay for members of the SES, divide the annual SES rate of basic pay by 2,087 and round to the nearest cent, counting one-half cent and over as a whole cent. To derive the biweekly rate, multiply the hourly rate by 80.
(c) Senior executives are subject to the applicable aggregate limitation on pay in 5 CFR part 530, subpart B.

Restrictions on premium pay and compensatory time.
(a) Under 5 U.S.C. 5541(2)(xvi) and 5 CFR 550.101(b)(18), members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) are excluded from premium pay, including overtime pay.
(b) Since SES members are not eligible for overtime pay, they also are not eligible for compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay for work performed as an SES member. SES members are eligible, however, for compensatory time off for religious purposes under 5 U.S.C. 5550a and 5 CFR part 550, subpart J.

§ 534.501
Purpose.
This subpart provides rules for setting and adjusting rates of basic pay for senior-level (SL) and scientific or professional (ST) employees under 5 U.S.C. 5376. Section 5376, as amended by section 2 of the Senior Professional Performance Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-372, October 8, 2008), promotes performance-based pay by enabling an agency that attains certification of a performance appraisal system covering senior professionals to fix rates of basic pay for those employees up to the rate payable for level II of the Executive Schedule. Under 5 U.S.C. 5307(d) and subpart D of part 430 of this chapter, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) concurrence, grants certification only to a performance appraisal system that, in its design and application, makes meaningful distinctions based upon relative performance. This subpart implements the purpose of the law by providing for pay determinations for SL and ST employees to be based on individual performance, contributions to the agency's performance, or both, as determined through administration of the agency's performance management system(s) for SL and ST employees.
§ 534.502
Coverage.
(a) This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 5376 and applies to—

(b) This subpart does not apply to—
(1) Senior Executive Service positions established under 5 U.S.C. 3132, unless the incumbent of the position declined to convert to the SES and, under § 317.303 of this chapter, remained at grade GS-16, 17, or 18 (now the SL pay system) or under the ST pay system;
(2) Positions in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration Senior Executive Service, Defense Intelligence Executive Service, or Senior Cryptologic Executive Service; or

In an agency that employs ten or more senior professionals, these controls must include centralized review of ratings proposed under § 430.208 of this chapter and pay actions proposed under § 534.507 by a panel of individuals designated by the agency head to provide advice from an agency-wide perspective for authorized agency officials to consider before approving pay adjustments on whether—
(i) Ratings of record and performance ratings proposed for senior professionals accurately reflect their individual performance, contributions to agency performance, or both, and take into account, as appropriate, assessment of the agency's performance against program performance measures and other relevant considerations; and
(ii) Proposed pay adjustments for senior professionals conform to the requirements of § 534.507 and appropriately correspond to proposed ratings of record and performance ratings.
(b) Each agency's written procedure must provide that, effective at the beginning of the first applicable pay period commencing on or after the first day of the month in which an adjustment takes effect under 5 U.S.C. 5303 in the rates of basic pay under the General Schedule, the head of an agency will adjust a senior professional's rate of basic pay under the provisions of § 534.507.
(c) The following actions must be approved by the agency head or by a designee who provides the certifications described in § 430.404(a)(6)(i), (ii) and
(iii) of this chapter for all senior professionals in the agency, and this approval authority may not be further delegated:
(1) Any pay-setting action under § 534.506 or any pay increase under § 534.507 that results in a rate of basic pay that is within the highest 10 percent of the applicable rate range under § 534.504. A rate of basic pay equal to or above the amount derived using the following rules is considered to be within the highest 10 percent of the applicable pay range (in 2015, $177,166 or above if the applicable system is certified, or $164,026 or above if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply):
(i) Subtract the minimum rate of basic pay from the maximum rate of basic pay for the applicable rate range under § 534.504 (in 2015, $183,300−$121,956 = $61,344 if the applicable system is certified, or $168,700−$121,956 = $46,744 if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply);
(ii) Multiply the amount derived in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section by 0.10 (in 2015, $61,344 − 0.10 = $6,134 if the applicable system is certified, or $46,744 − 0.10 = $4,674 if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply); and
(iii) Subtract the amount derived in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section from the maximum rate of basic pay applicable under § 534.504 (in 2015, $183,300−$6,134 = $177,166 if the applicable system is certified, or $168,700−$4,674 = $164,026 if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply);
(2) Any pay increase under § 534.507 that results in a rate of basic pay more than 10 percent above the SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay as in effect on the last day of the preceding fiscal year or, if the individual was first appointed as an SL or ST employee in the agency after the last day of the preceding fiscal year, more than 10 percent above the rate of basic pay set at the time of that appointment. A rate of basic pay more than 10 percent above the applicable rate of basic pay is considered to be any rate of basic pay that exceeds the amount derived by multiplying the applicable rate of basic pay by a factor of 1.1;
(3) Any pay-setting action under § 534.506(c)(2) that results in a higher rate of basic pay than the senior professional had upon leaving the agency; and
(4) Any off-cycle pay increase under § 534.510.
(d) An agency must keep its written procedures for setting and increasing rates of basic pay up to date, make them available to affected SL and ST employees, periodically provide training or supplemental guidance to clarify how they are applied, and provide a copy to OPM upon request.
(e)(1) The head of an agency may delegate to an Inspector General the authority to set and adjust pay for senior professionals in the Office of the Inspector General, including authority for pay actions described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) An agency head who delegates to an Inspector General the authority to set and adjust pay for all senior professionals in the Office of the Inspector General, including all pay actions described in paragraph (c) of this section, may exclude those senior professionals from the count of agency senior professionals for the purpose of determining whether centralized review under paragraph (a)(5) of this section is required.
(3) An Inspector General to whom an agency head delegates authority to set and adjust pay for 10 or more senior professionals in the Office of the Inspector General must provide the centralized review required by paragraph (a)(5) of this section and may use Federal employees from outside the agency for that purpose or from the Inspector General community, whether or not in the same agency.
(f)(1) A panel performing centralized review under paragraphs (a)(5) or (e)(3) of this section for a senior professional who holds a career or career-conditional appointment or an appointment of equivalent tenure in the excepted service must have a majority of career appointees.
(2) For the purpose of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a career appointee is considered to be a career SES member or a senior professional who holds a career or career-conditional appointment
or an appointment of equivalent tenure in the excepted service.
(3) An agency head may include Federal employees from outside the agency on a panel performing centralized review.
(4) An agency using the discretion provided in § 430.403(d) of this chapter must do so in accordance with paragraphs (a)(5), (e) and (f) of this section, as applicable.

§ 534.506
Setting a rate of basic pay upon appointment.
(a) An authorized agency official may set the rate of basic pay of an individual who is not currently an SL or ST appointee of the agency at any rate within the applicable rate range under § 534.504(a) upon appointment to an SL or ST position in the agency, subject to the requirements of this section. In setting a new senior professional's rate of basic pay, an agency must consider the nature and quality of the individual's experience, accomplishments, and any unique skills, qualifications, or competencies the individual possesses as they relate to requirements of the senior professional position and its impact on the agency's performance. When making a first appointment (regardless of tenure) as a civilian employee of the Federal Government, an agency may not consider the individual's salary history (
i.e.,
existing salary or prior salary) or a salary from a competing job offer. Rates of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule, but less than or equal to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule, generally are reserved for those newly appointed senior professionals who possess superior leadership, scientific, professional or other competencies necessary to address key program and mission requirements, as determined by the agency through its strategic human capital planning process.
(b) Consistent with the agency's written procedures and paragraph (a) of this section, an authorized agency official may set the rate of basic pay for an SL or ST employee upon transfer from another agency at any rate of basic pay within the pay range that applies to the SL or ST position under § 534.504(a), except as provided in § 534.509(a).
(c)(1) Consistent with the agency's written procedures and paragraph (a) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an authorized agency official may set pay upon reappointment of a former SL or ST employee at any rate of basic pay within the pay range that applies to the SL or ST position under § 534.504(a). When setting pay, the agency may not consider the individual's non-Federal salary history (
i.e.,
existing salary or prior salary) or a salary from a competing job offer.
(2) If a former agency SL or ST employee is reappointed within 30 days to the same position or a successor position in the same agency, the agency may not give the individual a higher rate of basic pay upon reappointment unless the agency head or a designee who provides the certifications described in § 430.404(a)(6)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this chapter for all senior professionals in the agency determines that a higher rate of basic pay is warranted.
[79 FR 12357, Mar. 5, 2014, as amended at 89 FR 5755, Jan. 30, 2024]
§ 534.507
Annual increases in basic pay.
(a)(1) Effective at the beginning of the first applicable pay period commencing on or after the first day of the month in which an adjustment takes effect under 5 U.S.C. 5303 in the rates of basic pay under the General Schedule, the head of an agency must adjust a senior professional's rate of basic pay under paragraph (b) of this section by an amount he or she considers appropriate, subject to the applicable maximum rate under § 534.504(a), the agency's written procedures under § 534.505, and the provisions of this section.
(2) A determination by an authorized agency official to make a zero adjustment in pay after reviewing a senior professional's current rating of record or performance rating meets the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if the notice required by paragraph (h) of this section is provided to the senior professional.
(3) A pay adjustment under paragraph (a)(1) or a determination under
paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not restrict the authority of an agency head to increase pay at other times under § 534.510, if warranted.
(b)(1) An agency may provide a pay increase to a senior professional only upon a determination by the authorized agency official that the senior professional's performance and/or contributions to agency performance so warrant.
(2) Increases resulting in a rate of basic pay that exceeds the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule, but is less than or equal to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule, are reserved for those senior professionals who demonstrate the highest levels of individual performance, make the greatest contributions to the agency's performance, or both, as determined by the agency through the administration of its performance management system.
(3) A pay increase must reflect the agency's judgment concerning the value of the employee's characteristic and continuing service to the agency in the SL or ST position. A single noteworthy contribution that is not characteristic of the employee's continuing performance requirements, individual performance or contributions to the agency's performance should be recognized by an appropriate award under part 451, subpart A of this chapter or other appropriate authority, rather than by a permanent increase in the rate of basic pay.
(c) An agency must document the basis for each pay increase granted under paragraph (b) by means of—
(1) A current rating of record; or
(2) A performance rating that covers a period of at least 90 days and is assigned in accordance with subpart B of part 430 of this chapter and the centralized review required by § 534.505(a)(5), but only if a rating of record is not available or does not reflect current performance.
(d) Any increase under this section that results in a rate of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule may not be made effective unless—
(1) The rating of record or performance rating used to justify the increase covers a period of at least 90 days of performance during which the applicable performance appraisal system has continuously been certified under 5 U.S.C. 5307(d) and part 430, subpart D of this chapter;
(2) The rating of record or performance rating used to justify the increase becomes final while the applicable performance appraisal system is certified;
(3) The rating and pay increase are reviewed and approved in accordance with § 534.505(a);
(4) The pay increase is approved in accordance with § 534.505(c), as applicable, and the agency's written procedures; and
(5) The pay increase becomes effective while the applicable performance appraisal system is certified.
(e) Upon the initial certification under 5 U.S.C. 5307(d) and part 430, subpart D of this chapter by OPM, with OMB concurrence, of an agency performance appraisal system covering SL or ST employees, OPM may waive the requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The requirement may be waived only if OPM determines that the agency has, for a period of no less than 90 days prior to certification, consistently applied the same performance appraisal system to covered SL or ST employees in a manner consistent with certification. If OPM waives this requirement, OPM will notify the agency in writing.
(f) Except as required by paragraph (g) of this section, a pay increase under this section may not be provided to an employee—
(1) Who has a current rating of record below Level 3 (Fully Successful or equivalent), as described in § 430.208 of this chapter; or
(2) Who, after receiving a rating of record at Level 3 or above, receives a more recent performance rating that rates performance in a critical element at a level below Fully Successful, as described in § 430.206(b)(8)(i) of this chapter.
(g) An SL or ST employee whose rate of basic pay would otherwise fall below the minimum rate of the SL and ST pay range under § 534.504(a)(1) must be provided a pay adjustment sufficient to maintain the minimum rate of basic pay.
(h)(1) If the rates of basic pay under the General Schedule are increased under 5 U.S.C. 5303 on the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the agency head decides upon a zero adjustment for an SL or ST employee who has a current rating of record or applicable performance rating at Level 3 or above, as described in § 430.208 of this chapter, the agency must communicate the reasons for that decision to the employee in writing.
(2) Paragraph (h)(1) of this section does not apply to a senior professional with a rate of basic pay described in § 534.505(c)(1) unless—
(i) The rates of basic pay for the Executive Schedule are also increased on the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and
(ii) The senior professional has a current rating of record or applicable performance rating at Level 4 in an appraisal program that uses summary level pattern C or G, or at Level 5 in an appraisal program that uses summary level pattern B, E, F, or H, as described in § 430.208 of this chapter.
(3) Paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section may not be construed to require a pay increase for any senior professional employee.
§ 534.508
Reductions in a rate of basic pay.
(a) Any reduction in a rate of basic pay for an SL or ST employee is subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter except as otherwise provided in this section.
(b) If an employee is removed from an SL or ST position and placed in a General Schedule position under procedures in part 752, subpart D of this chapter or part 432 of this chapter providing for reduction in grade, or otherwise moves voluntarily or involuntarily to a General Schedule position, the employee is entitled to the minimum rate of basic pay, as defined in § 531.203 of this chapter, for the General Schedule grade unless the agency sets the employee's pay at a higher rate under—
(1) The maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221 of this chapter, if applicable;
(2) The superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority in § 531.212 of this chapter, if applicable; or
(3) The pay retention rules in part 536, subpart C of this chapter, if applicable.
(c) An agency may reduce an SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay, subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter, upon movement to a different SL or ST position within the agency. If an SL or ST employee elects to accept a reduction in pay to facilitate a reassignment and the agency documents the voluntary nature of the action, the resulting pay reduction is not subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter.
(d) If an agency justifies an increase in an SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay under § 534.510 upon the employee's movement to another SL or ST position having a substantially greater impact on agency performance with the understanding that the employee will be reduced to his or her former rate of basic pay upon movement out of the position, and the agency documents the voluntary nature of the action, the resulting reduction to the former rate of basic pay (or to a higher rate of basic pay determined under this subpart that is within the pay range applicable to the SL or ST position under § 534.504(a)) is not subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter.
(e) A reduction in the rate of basic pay of an SL or ST employee under § 534.506(b) upon transfer is considered voluntary upon the employee's acceptance of the appointment and is not subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter, except that an SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay may not be reduced upon transfer under circumstances described in § 534.509(a). A reduction in the rate of basic pay of an SL or ST employee upon a transfer of function under part 351, subpart C of this chapter from another agency is subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter unless otherwise provided by statute.
§ 534.509
Preservation of an established rate of basic pay.
(a) An SL or ST employee whose rate of basic pay is higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule may not suffer a reduction in pay as a result of transfer to an SL or ST position in another agency where the maximum rate of basic pay for the applicable SL
or ST rate range is equal to the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule.
(b) An SL or ST employee whose rate of basic pay is higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule may not suffer a reduction in pay because his or her agency's applicable performance appraisal system certification expires or is suspended under § 430.405(h) of this chapter. See § 530.203(g) and (h) of this chapter for treatment of the aggregate pay limit when certification status changes during the calendar year.
(c) An agency may continue an SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule upon that employee's movement within the agency to an SL or ST position that is not under a certified performance appraisal system. Pay may be reduced upon the movement only as provided in § 534.508.
(d) If an agency grants a temporary pay increase under conditions described in § 534.508(d) to an SL or ST employee subject to a certified performance appraisal system who, prior to the temporary pay increase, has a rate of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule, the agency may return the employee to an SL or ST position that is not subject to a certified performance appraisal system when the temporary assignment ends and set the SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay at the rate in effect immediately before the temporary pay increase.
(e) When a rate of basic pay that is higher than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule is preserved under a provision of this section, the SL or ST employee will continue to receive his or her current rate of basic pay and is not eligible for a pay increase until he or she is assigned to an SL or ST position covered by a certified performance appraisal system or his or her rate of basic pay is less than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule.
(f) An agency that is otherwise subject to the limitation in § 534.504(a)(2)(i) with respect to an SL or ST position occupied by an SL or ST employee whose rate of basic pay is authorized to be preserved under paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section may set that employee's rate of basic pay above EX-III only at the level required to preserve the applicable rate.
(g) Preservation of a rate of basic pay under this section does not preclude a subsequent reduction in pay as provided in § 534.508.
(h) The provisions of this section do not apply upon the appointment of a senior professional employee to a position in the Senior Executive Service or upon the appointment of a member of the Senior Executive Service to a senior professional position.
§ 534.510
Off-cycle pay increases.
(a) An authorized agency official may provide an off-cycle pay increase to a senior professional if, and only if, the agency head or a designee who provides the certifications described in § 430.404(a)(6)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this chapter for all senior professionals in the agency determines an off-cycle pay increase is warranted and approves the amount of the increase, subject to the requirements of this section and the agency's written procedures established under § 534.505. The authority to approve an off-cycle pay increase under this section may not be further delegated.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an off-cycle pay increase must be supported by factors that distinguish the level of the senior professional's performance and/or contributions to agency performance from that of his or her peers, as applicable, and from that sufficiently rewarded through the annual pay adjustment. In assessing the warrant for an off-cycle pay increase, the approving official may consider such factors as—
(1) A senior professional's exceptionally meritorious accomplishments that contribute significantly to the agency's performance;
(2) The need to offer a pay increase to reassign a senior professional to a position that has a substantially greater impact on agency performance; and
(3) The need to retain a senior professional whose contributions are critical to the agency and who is likely to leave the agency in the absence of a pay increase.
(c) Each off-cycle pay increase that is based upon such factors as are described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3)
of this section must be documented in accordance with § 534.507(b) through (e), except that the agency must also provide information to explain how each applicable factor was considered in determining the pay increase. This information may be derived from the agency's written pay procedures established under § 534.505, agency performance management system activities, or other sources the agency deems useful for this purpose.
(d) If the maximum rate of basic pay applicable to an agency's senior professionals increases during the 1 year period following the annual pay adjustment under § 534.507(a)(1) for reasons other than a change in the certification status of an applicable performance appraisal system, the agency head or a designee who provides the certifications described in § 430.404(a)(6)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this chapter for all senior professionals in the agency may consider whether, and to what extent, an additional pay increase may be warranted for a senior professional based on the same criteria used in determining his or her annual pay increase. However, if the increase in maximum rate of basic pay is due to a change in the certification status of an applicable performance appraisal system, the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply.
(e) An off-cycle pay increase granted under this section will be effective prospectively, not retroactively.
§ 534.511
Exemption from performance appraisal requirements.
(a) An agency responsible for setting and adjusting rates of basic pay for SL or ST employees or positions excluded from performance appraisal by or under statute is, with respect to those employees or positions, exempt from any provision of this subpart to the extent that it makes a pay determination contingent upon performance appraisal, including—
(1) Section 534.505(a)(1), (2) and (3) to the extent these paragraphs require that an agency's plan for setting and increasing rates of basic pay reflect meaningful distinctions among SL and ST employees based upon individual performance and include criteria that ensure individuals with the highest levels of individual performance, or the greatest contributions to agency performance, or both, receive the highest pay increases. The agency must still provide written procedures for setting and adjusting rates of pay for covered SL and ST employees that specify criteria that will be applied consistent with applicable law. The remaining provisions of § 534.505 apply, except for references in § 534.505(a)(5) to compliance with certification requirements and centralized review of ratings and pay actions;
(2) Section 534.507(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f). The agency must still document in writing the basis for each pay increase under § 534.507 in accordance with criteria specified in the agency's written procedures under § 534.505(a); and
(3) Section 534.510(b) and (c). The agency must still document in writing the basis for each off-cycle pay increase under § 534.510 in accordance with criteria specified in the agency's written procedures under § 534.505(a).
(b) Except as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, an agency responsible for setting and adjusting rates of basic pay for SL or ST employees excluded from performance appraisal by or under statute is subject to the requirements of this subpart with respect to those employees.
(c) The maximum rate of basic pay for an SL or ST employee or position not subject to performance appraisal is the maximum rate described in § 534.504(a)(2)(i). An agency head who uses the exemption in paragraph (a) of this section to set the rate of basic pay for SL or ST employees who are not subject to performance appraisal may not certify that those employees are covered by a performance appraisal system meeting the certification criteria established in part 430, subpart D of this chapter for purposes of authorizing rates of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule.
(d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, an agency responsible for setting and adjusting rates of basic pay for SL or ST employees or positions excluded from performance appraisal by or under statute is subject to § 534.509(a) when setting a rate of basic pay for an SL or ST employee upon transfer to such a position. The agency
may also apply § 534.509(c) upon movement of an SL or ST employee whose rate of basic pay was initially set under § 534.509(a) or (c) to another SL or ST position that is excluded from performance appraisal. Pay may be reduced upon the movement only as provided in § 534.508. In either case, the employee will not be eligible for a pay increase until he or she is appointed to an SL or ST position that is subject to a certified performance appraisal system or until his or her rate of basic pay is less than the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule.

§ 534.602
Definitions.
Administrative appeals judge position

§ 534.603
Rates of basic pay.
(a) The administrative appeals judge pay system (AA) has six rates of basic pay—AA-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. These rates correspond to the rates of basic pay for AL-3/A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively, of the administrative law judge pay system established under 5 U.S.C. 5372 and part 930, subpart B, of this chapter.
(b) The rates of basic pay of the administrative appeals judge pay system will be adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as adjustments are made in the corresponding rates of basic pay for the administrative law judge pay system under 5 U.S.C. 5372.
§ 534.604
Pay administration.
(a) The head of each agency must fix the rate of basic pay for each administrative appeals judge position within the agency.
(b) Upon initial appointment, an agency must set the rate of basic pay of an administrative appeals judge at the minimum rate AA-1 of the administrative appeals judge pay system, except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
(c) An agency must set the pay of an employee under the General Schedule pay system who is appointed to an administrative appeals judge position without a break in service at the lowest rate of basic pay of the administrative appeals judge pay system that equals or exceeds the rate of basic pay the employee received immediately prior to such appointment, not to exceed the rate of basic pay for AA-6. If the resulting basic pay increase is less than one-half of the dollar value of the employee's next within-grade increase, the agency must set the employee's rate of basic pay at the next higher rate of basic pay in the basic rate
range of the administrative appeals judge pay system, not to exceed the rate of basic pay for AA-6.
(d) An agency may offer an administrative appeals judge applicant with prior Federal service a rate up to the lowest rate of basic pay of the administrative appeals judge pay system that equals or exceeds the employee's highest previous rate of basic pay in a Federal civil service position, not to exceed the rate of basic pay for AA-6. Before setting pay under this paragraph, an agency must establish a policy that includes the following elements:
(1) Designation of officials with the authority to approve and set pay under this paragraph (d);
(2) Whether use of this authority is discretionary or mandatory;
(3) The factors the designated officials may or must consider in determining the rate at which to set the applicant's pay and which must include consideration of the rate of basic pay set for other administrative appeals judges (based on the level, type, or quality of the appointee's skills or competencies or other qualities and experiences); and
(4) Documentation and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to allow reconstruction of the action.
(e) An agency may offer an administrative appeals judge applicant (including a former administrative appeals judge) with superior qualifications who is not a current Federal employee a higher than minimum rate up to the maximum rate AA-6 when such a rate is clearly necessary to meet the needs of the Government. Superior qualifications for applicants include, but are not limited to, having legal practice before the hiring agency, having practice in another forum with legal issues of concern to the hiring agency, or having an outstanding reputation among others in the field. An agency must document all of the following:
(1) The superior qualifications of the applicant;
(2) The need of the Government for the applicant's services;
(3) Consideration of how pay has been set for administrative appeals judges who had similar qualifications (based on the level, type, or quality of the applicant's skills or competencies or other qualities and experiences) and who have been newly appointed to positions that are similar to the applicant's position (based on the position's occupational series, organization, geographic location, or other job-relevant factors), if applicable; and
(4) An explanation of the factors which were used to justify the rate at which the employee's pay is set, except an agency may not consider the applicant's salary history (
i.e.,
existing salary or prior salary) or a salary from a competing job offer.
(f) Administrative appeals judges will advance successively to rates AA-2, 3, and 4 upon completion of 52 weeks of service in the next lower rate, and to rates 5 and 6 upon completion of 104 weeks of service in the next lower rate. Advancement to a higher rate takes effect on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after completion of the required period of service. Time in a nonpay status is creditable service in the computation of a waiting period in so far as it does not exceed 2 weeks for each 52 weeks of service. Time in a nonpay status is fully creditable if the absence is due to military service, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8331(13), or receipt of injury compensation under chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code. Time under pay systems outside the administrative appeals judge pay system is not creditable service in computing the required waiting period, except that time under the administrative law judge pay system established under 5 U.S.C. 5372 is creditable when an individual moves from that system to the administrative appeals judge pay system without a break in service.
(g) An agency must use the following procedures to convert an administrative appeals judge's annual rate of basic pay to an hourly, daily, weekly, or biweekly rate:
(1) To derive an hourly rate, divide the annual rate of pay by 2,087 and round to the nearest cent, counting one-half cent and over as the next higher cent.
(2) To derive a daily rate, multiply the hourly rate by the number of daily hours of service required by the administrative appeals judge's basic daily tour of duty.
(3) To derive a weekly or biweekly rate, multiply the hourly rate by 40 or 80, as the case may be.
[66 FR 63908, Dec. 11, 2001, as amended at 89 FR 5756, Jan. 30, 2024]
§ 534.605
Conversion.
On the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after December 11, 2001, agencies must convert the rate of basic pay of an administrative appeals judge to the lowest rate of basic pay provided by § 534.603(a) of this subpart that equals or exceeds the rate of basic pay the administrative appeals judge received immediately before that date.

(2) To the extent necessary to recruit or retain an individual exceptionally well-qualified for the critical position.
(c) If critical position pay authority is granted for a position, the head of an agency may determine whether it is appropriate to exercise the authority with respect to any proposed appointee or incumbent of the position.
(d) An agency granted critical position pay authority may continue to use the authority for an authorized position as long as needed. OPM will monitor the use of critical position pay authorities annually, through the agency's required reports under § 535.107, and will terminate the authority associated with a given position after notifying the agency if, in OPM's judgment in consultation with OMB, the authority is no longer needed.
§ 535.104
Requests for and granting critical position pay authority.
(a) An agency may request critical position pay authority only after determining that the position in question cannot be filled with an exceptionally well-qualified individual through the use of other available human resources flexibilities and pay authorities. Agency requests must include the information in paragraph (d) of this section. OPM, in consultation with OMB, will review agency requests. OPM will advise the requesting agency as to whether the request is approved and when the agency's critical position pay authority becomes effective.
(b) A request for critical position pay authority (or authorities) must be signed by the head of an agency and submitted to OPM. Requests covering multiple positions must include a list of the positions in priority order. The head of an agency may request coverage of positions of a type not listed in 5 U.S.C. 5377(a)(2), as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5377(i)(2) and Executive Order 13415.
(c) Requests for critical position pay authority to set pay above the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule and up to the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule because of exceptional circumstances require information and data that justify the higher pay. Requests for critical position pay authority to set pay above the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule due to rare circumstances require approval by the President. The head of an agency must submit such requests to OPM with the information required in paragraph (d) of this section. If OPM, in consultation with OMB, concurs with a request to set pay above the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule, OPM will seek the President's approval. The President may establish a maximum limitation on the critical pay rate.
(d) At a minimum, all requests for critical position pay authority must include:
(1) Position title;
(2) Position appointment authority (for Senior Executive Service positions, appointment authority for any incumbent);
(3) Pay plan and grade/level;
(4) Occupational series of the position;
(5) Geographic location of the position;
(6) Current salary of the position or incumbent;
(7) Name of incumbent (or “Vacant”);
(8) Length of time the incumbent has been in the position or length of time the position has been vacant;
(9) A written evaluation of the need to designate the position as critical. Such an evaluation must include—
(i) The kinds of work required by the position and the context within which it operates;
(ii) The range of positions and qualification requirements that characterize the occupational field, including those that require extremely high levels of expertise;
(iii) The rates of pay reasonably and generally required in the public and private sectors for similar positions; and
(iv) The availability of individuals who possess the qualifications to do the work required by the position;
(10) Documentation, with appropriate supporting data, of the agency's experience and, as appropriate, the experience of other organizations, in efforts to recruit or retain exceptionally well-qualified individuals for the position or for a position sufficiently similar with respect to the occupational field, required qualifications, and other pertinent factors, to provide a reliable comparison;
(11) Assessment of why the agency could not, through diligent and comprehensive recruitment efforts and without using the critical position pay authority, fill the position within a reasonable period with an individual who could perform the duties and responsibilities in a manner sufficient to
fulfill the agency's mission. This assessment must include a justification as to why the agency could not, as an effective alternative, use other human resources flexibilities and pay authorities, such as recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives under 5 CFR part 575;
(12) An explanation regarding why the position should be designated a critical position and made eligible for a higher rate of pay under this part within its organizational context (
i.e.
, relative to other positions in the organization) and, when applicable, how it compares with other critical positions in the agency. The agency must include an explanation of how it will deal with perceived inequities among agency employees (e.g., situations in which employees in positions designated as critical would receive higher rates of pay than their peers, supervisors, or other employees in positions with higher-level duties and responsibilities);
(13) Documentation of the effect on the successful accomplishment of important agency missions if the position is not designated as a critical position, including an explanation and justification for OPM and OMB to expedite processing in cases where the agency believes that urgency warrants expedited processing;
(14) Any additional information the agency may deem appropriate to demonstrate that higher pay is needed to recruit or retain an employee for a critical position;
(15) Unless the position is an Executive Schedule position, a copy of the position description and qualification standard for the critical position; and
(16) The desired rate of basic pay for requests to set pay above the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule and justification to show that such a rate is necessary to recruit and retain an individual exceptionally well-qualified for the critical position.
§ 535.105
Setting and adjusting rates of basic pay.
(a) The rate of basic pay for a critical position may not be less than the rate of basic pay, including any locality-based comparability payments established under 5 U.S.C. 5304 or special rate supplement under 5 U.S.C. 5305 (or other similar payment or supplement under other legal authority) that would otherwise be payable for the position.
(b) If critical position pay authority is granted for a position, the head of an agency may set pay initially at any amount up to the rate of pay for level II or level I of the Executive Schedule, as applicable, without further approval unless a higher maximum rate is approved by the President under § 535.104(c).
(c) The head of an agency may make subsequent adjustments in the rate of basic pay for a critical position each January at the same time general pay adjustments are authorized for Executive Schedule employees under section 5318 of title 5, United States Code. Such adjusted rates may not exceed the new rate for Executive Schedule level II or other applicable maximum established for the critical position. However, the employee must have at least a rating of Fully Successful or equivalent, and subsequent adjustments must be based on labor market factors, recruitment and retention needs, and individual accomplishments and contributions to an agency's mission.
(d) Employees receiving critical position pay are not entitled to locality-based comparability payments established under 5 U.S.C. 5304, special rate supplements under 5 U.S.C. 5305, or other similar payments or supplements under other legal authority.
(e) If an agency discontinues critical position pay for a given position (on its own initiative or because OPM, in consultation with OMB, terminates the authority under § 535.103(d)), the employee's rate of basic pay will be set at the rate to which the employee would be entitled had he or she not received critical pay, as determined by the head of the agency, unless the employee is eligible for a higher payable rate under the General Schedule maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221 and the agency chooses to apply that rule.
§ 535.106
Treatment as rate of basic pay.
A critical position pay rate is considered a rate of basic pay for all purposes, including any applicable premium pay, except—
(a) Application of any saved pay or pay retention provisions (e.g., 5 U.S.C. 5363); or
(b) Application of any adverse action provisions (e.g., 5 U.S.C. 7512).
§ 535.107
Annual reporting requirements.
(a) OPM must submit an annual report to Congress on the use of the critical position pay authority. Agencies must submit the following information to OPM by January 31 of each year on their use of critical position pay authority for the previous calendar year:
(1) The name, title, pay plan, and grade/level of each employee receiving a higher rate of basic pay under this subpart;
(2) The annual rate or rates of basic pay paid in the preceding calendar year to each employee in a critical position;
(3) The beginning and ending dates of such rate(s) of basic pay, as applicable;
(4) The rate or rates of basic pay that would have been paid but for the grant of critical position pay. This includes what the rate or rates of basic pay were, or would have been, without critical position pay at the time critical position pay is initially exercised and any subsequent adjustments to basic pay that would have been made if critical position pay authority had not been exercised; and
(5) Whether the authority is still needed for the critical position(s).

§ 536.101
Purpose.
This part contains OPM regulations for the administration of grade and pay retention. This part supplements and implements the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5361-5366 and must be read together with those sections of law. Under 5 U.S.C. 5362, an employee under a covered pay system who is placed in a
lower grade (e.g., as a result of a reduction in force or when his or her position is reduced in grade as a result of a reclassification) is entitled to retain the grade held immediately before the reduction for a period of 2 years under the circumstances prescribed in this part. Under 5 U.S.C. 5363, an employee whose rate of basic pay otherwise would be reduced as a result of a management action is entitled to retain his or her rate of basic pay under the circumstances prescribed in this part.
§ 536.102
Coverage.
(a) Subject to the exclusions in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, this part covers any employee who, at the time this part is applied—
(1) Is in a covered pay system; or
(2) Is moving to a position under a covered pay system from a position not under a covered pay system, as long as the individual was an
employee
as defined in 5 CFR 536.103 while serving in the position in a noncovered pay system.
(b) An agency may not provide grade or pay retention under this part to an employee who—
(1) Is reduced in grade or pay for personal cause or at the employee's request;
(2) Was employed on a temporary or term basis immediately before the action causing the reduction in grade or pay;
(3) Does not satisfactorily complete the probationary period prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 3321(a)(2), and, as a result, is removed from a supervisory or managerial position;
(4) Is entitled to receive a saved rate of basic pay under 5 U.S.C. 3594(c) and 5 CFR 359.705 because of removal from the Senior Executive Service and placement in a civil service position (other than a Senior Executive Service position) under 5 U.S.C. 3594(b)(2);
(5) Moves from an Executive Schedule position paid under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter II, or a position whose rate of pay is fixed by law at a rate equal to a rate for the Executive Schedule;
(6) Moves between positions not under a covered pay system or from a position under a covered pay system to a position not under a covered pay system;
(7) Moves to a nonappropriated fund position as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c) (except a position occupied by a prevailing rate employee);
(8) Moves from a nonappropriated fund position as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c) (except a position occupied by a prevailing rate employee) to a position in a covered pay system, unless covered by § 536.302(a); or
(9) Is reduced in pay upon termination of a critical position pay authority under 5 CFR part 535.
(c) An agency may not provide grade or pay retention under this part based on the grade or rate of basic pay held by the employee during a temporary promotion or temporary reassignment. However, a temporary promotion or temporary reassignment does not affect an employee's preexisting entitlement to grade or pay retention.
(d) An agency may not provide grade retention under subpart B of this part to an employee who moves from a position not under a covered pay system to a position under a covered pay system.
(e) An employee loses eligibility for or entitlement to grade or pay retention under the conditions specified in §§ 536.207, 536.208, and 536.308.
[70 FR 31305, May 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 50183, Aug. 26, 2008]
§ 536.103
Definitions.
For the purpose of this part:
Authorized agency official
means the head of the agency or an official who is authorized to act for the head of the agency in the matter concerned.
Comparison rate
means—
(1) For the purpose of comparing grades that are under different covered pay systems under § 536.105 and after applying any applicable geographic conversion under § 536.105(b) for positions with different official worksites—
(i) The highest rate of basic pay that applies to the fourth step of the grade for a position covered by the General Schedule; and
(ii) The highest rate of basic pay that applies to the second step of the grade of a position under a regular prevailing rate system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV, or, in the case of a prevailing rate position with
a single rate, the single rate of basic pay for that position; and
(2) For the purpose of comparing grades or levels of work in making reasonable offer determinations when one of the grades or levels of work is not under a covered pay system and after applying any applicable geographic conversion rules under § 536.105(b) for positions with different official worksites—
(i) The maximum payable rate of basic pay that applies to the grade of a position covered by the General Schedule;
(ii) The maximum payable rate of basic pay that applies to the grade of a position under a regular prevailing rate system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV, or in the case of a prevailing rate position with a single rate, the single rate of basic pay for that position; and
(iii) The maximum payable rate of basic pay that applies to the grade or level of work in the case of a position not covered by paragraph (2)(i) or (ii) of this definition. In the case of a position with a single rate under such a schedule, the single rate of basic pay for that position is the comparison rate.
Covered pay system
means a covered pay schedule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5361(5)—
i.e.
, the General Schedule pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter III; a prevailing rate system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV; or a special occupational pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IX. The various prevailing rate systems under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV, are considered separate systems if they have separate job grading structures.
Employed on a temporary or term basis
means employment under an appointment having a definite time limitation or designated as temporary or term.
Employee
has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105, except that
employee
also includes—
(1) An individual employed by the U.S. Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission who would be considered an employee under 5 U.S.C. 2105 but for the exclusion in section 2105(e); and
(2) An individual employed by a Department of Defense or Coast Guard nonappropriated fund instrumentality (as described in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c)) who is moved without a break in service of more than 3 days from employment in such an instrumentality to a position under a covered pay system in the same agency.
FEPCA
means the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (section 529 of Pub. L. 101-509, November 5, 1990, as amended).
General Schedule
or
GS
means the classification and pay system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53. This term also refers to the pay schedule established under 5 U.S.C. 5332.
Highest applicable rate range
means the rate range applicable to an employee based on a given position of record and official worksite that provides the highest rates of basic pay, excluding any retained rates. For example, a rate range of special rates under 5 U.S.C. 5305 may exceed an applicable locality rate range under 5 U.S.C. 5304 for General Schedule employees. In certain circumstances, the
highest applicable rate range
may consist of two types of pay rates from different pay schedules—e.g., a range where special rates are higher in the lower portion of the range and locality rates are higher in the higher portion of the range.
Management action
means an action (not for personal cause) by an agency official not initiated or requested by an employee which may adversely affect the employee's grade or rate of basic pay. However, an employee's placement in or transfer to a position under a formal employee development program established by an agency for recruitment and employee advancement purposes (e.g., Recent Graduates Program) is considered a management action even though the employee initiates or requests such placement or transfer.
Official worksite
means the official location of the employee's position of record as determined under the rules of the applicable pay system (e.g., 5 CFR 531.605 for General Schedule employees).
Official worksite
is synonymous with the term “official duty station” as used in 5 U.S.C. 5363(c).
OPM
means the Office of Personnel Management.
Payable rate
means the highest rate of basic pay to which an employee is
entitled based on the employee's position of record, official worksite, and step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) or, if applicable, a retained rate.
Pay schedule
means a set of rate ranges established under a single authority—
i.e.
, the General Schedule, a law enforcement officer special base rate schedule (for grades GS-3 through 10) under section 403 of FEPCA; a prevailing rate schedule (including a special schedule or special rate schedule) under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV; a locality rate schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5304 based on GS rates; a locality rate schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5304 based on law enforcement officer special base rates (for grades GS-3 through 10); or a special rate schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5305 or similar authority. A pay schedule applies to or covers a defined category of employees based on established coverage conditions (e.g., official worksite, occupation). A pay schedule is considered to apply to or cover an employee who meets the established coverage conditions even when a rate under that schedule is not currently payable to the employee because of a higher pay entitlement under another pay schedule.
Position of record
means an employee's official position (defined by grade, occupational series, employing agency, LEO status, and any other condition that determines coverage under a pay schedule (other than official worksite)), as documented on the employee's most recent Notification of Personnel Action (Standard Form 50 or equivalent) and current position description. A position to which an employee is temporarily detailed is not documented as a position of record. For an employee whose change in official position is followed within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee's separation before he or she is required to report for duty in the new position, the position of record in effect immediately before the position change is deemed to remain the position of record through the date of separation.
Prevailing rate employee
has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 5342(a)(2) and refers to an employee in a position covered by a prevailing rate system or schedule established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter IV.
Rate of basic pay
means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee before any deductions, including a General Schedule rate under 5 U.S.C. 5332; a law enforcement officer special base rate under section 403 of FEPCA; a special rate under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, or similar payment under other legal authority; a locality rate under 5 CFR part 531, subpart F, or similar payment under other legal authority; a prevailing rate under 5 U.S.C. 5343; or a retained rate under this part, but excluding additional pay of any other kind (such as premium payments, differentials, and allowances).
Rate range
or
range
means the range of rates of basic pay for a grade within an established pay schedule, excluding any retained rate.
Reasonable offer
means an offer that meets the conditions in § 536.104.
Reduced in grade or pay at the employee's request
